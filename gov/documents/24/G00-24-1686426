              EES-1 GROUP ENVIRONMENT, SAFETY, AND HEALTH PLAN


   1. Purpose:
       The purpose of this group environment, safety, and health (ES&H)
       plan is:

       to state Laboratory and group ES&H policies,
       to define management, visitor, and employee responsibilities,
       to identify the ES&H issues associated with group activities and to
       define measures to control, mitigate, or eliminate them, and
       to establish the organizational structure and control systems to
       implement and manage the ES&H plan.

   2. Statement of Laboratory and Group Policy

   The Laboratory will provide the highest level of protection to its
   employees, the public, government property, and the environment from
   harm that could arise from Laboratory operations. Line management is
   responsible for ensuring that only those work activities that can be
   carried out following safe, environmentally acceptable procedures, and
   in accordance with (Laboratory Implementation Requirements)
   LIR300-00-01.1, Safe Work Practices, revised date 6 October 1999, are
   authorized. Laboratory employees are required to observe the ES&H
   procedures and requirements specified by applicable Laboratory LIRs and
   State and Federal ES&H laws and regulations.


   3. Group ES&H Organization and Responsibilities

   a. Group Leader and Deputy Group Leader

   The Group Leader has the prime responsibility for all aspects of ES&H
   within the group. This responsibility includes developing the group
   ES&H plan and then implementing and managing it through organizational
   structure, Hazard Control Plans (HCPs), Management Walkarounds, ES&H
   meetings, training, and collaboration with subject-matter experts and
   ES&H specialists. The organizational structure consists of the group
   ES&H Representative, Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) Coordinator, As Low
   as Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) Coordinator, Waste Management
   Coordinator, Electrical Safety Officer, supervisors, and mentors within
   the group. The Group Leader is responsible for ensuring supervisors/
   mentors know their responsibilities in implementing and managing this
   plan and applicable Laboratory LIRs. Key factors in managing the ES&H
   plan are hazard assessments of new or changing operations, informal
   day-to-day observations, and Management Walkarounds. Written records of
   these activities, as appropriate, will be kept to demonstrate the plan
   has been implemented as designed and is properly managed. The Deputy
   Group Leader assists the Group Leader with these responsibilities.

   b. Employee, Student, and Visitor ES&H Responsibilities

   Laboratory employees, students, and visitors are responsible for their
   own health and safety and for their activities as they affect the
   environment. Their responsibilities also include observing applicable
   Laboratory LIRs, using prescribed personal protective equipment;
   promptly reporting accidents, injuries, and unsafe conditions; and
   participating in required medical and biological monitoring programs.
   They will also complete and stay current in the appropriate ES&H
   training as determined by their supervisor/mentor. Employees will
   schedule their own training offered by ESH Division. General employee
   rights and responsibilities as outlined in the ES&H handbook for
   employees are:

   Worker ES&H Rights
       As a Laboratory employee, student, or visitor you are entitled to
       as safe a workplace as is reasonably achievable. You have the right
       to know the potential hazards associated with your work and work
       area as well as the control measures being used to protect you from
       those hazards. Your workplace is monitored for exposure to harmful
       substances and the results are available to you.
       Do you believe your work environment is unsafe? Take the following
       steps in the order given.

   1. Contact your supervisor/mentor.
       2. Contact ESH Division (7-4218) if you believe that insufficient
       action is taken by your supervisor/mentor. In most cases, the ESH
       staff will be able to resolve your problem.
       3. If you feel that your problem remains unresolved, submit your
       concern to the Safety Concern Program at Web address
       http://remedy.lanl.gov/scs or call the Laboratory's ES&H Hotline
       (5-5010) if you wish to remain anonymous.
       4. Call the DOE Inspector General Hotline (1-800-541-1625) for
       waste, fraud, or abuse with environmental matters, or file a formal
       complaint with the Department of Energy, Los Alamos Area Office
       (LAAO) (7-5105).

   The Group ES&H Representative will provide the administrative support
   to ensure compliance with the written program (all documents required
   or associated with executing the plan) of the group ES&H plan through a
   documented record. The record system will be a two- year history of
   ES&H activities and will reflect management, supervisory, and employee
   diligence in carrying out group ES&H responsibilities. This system
   includes an ES&H file, the Laboratory Employee Development System, and
   Hazard Control Plan (HCP) tracking system. It will contain signed
   records (such as the Employee Safety Commitment) required for all
   employees, students, and visitors. It will contain records of meetings
   (summaries and attendance) and ES&H correspondence.

   d. The HAZCOM Communications (HAZCOM) Coordinator

   The HAZCOM Coordinator acts as the EES-1 contact point with ES&H
   Division in matters concerning hazards communication. The HAZCOM
   Coordinator serves as the "expert" and the initial contact for HAZCOM
   information requests from group members; advises the EES-1 Group Leader
   on compliance related issues; ensures that hazardous materials and
   operations are identified and labeled; and ensures that an inventory of
   all chemicals in the group is conducted in April-May each year and that
   material safety data sheets (MSDS) are maintained from each hazardous
   material used in the laboratories. The current HAZCOM Coordinator is
   listed in Appendix A.

   e. ALARA Coordinator

   The ALARA Coordinator serves as the group's primary ALARA focal point
   and carries out responsibilities as described in LIR402-702-01.1, ALARA
   and the group X-Ray Radiation Protection Program. In summary these
   include: promote awareness and commitment to ALARA policy; identify and
   document possible radiation sources; determine monitoring or data
   collection requirements; review exposure data; investigate exposure
   situations; ensure ALARA is considered in training, operations, design
   and modification of facilities and equipment, and emergency response
   planning/procedures; ensure awareness of prenatal radiation exposure
   limits; and report periodically to Group Leader concerning status of
   program and accomplishments. The current ALARA Coordinator is listed in
   Appendix A.

   f. Waste Management Coordinator

   The Waste Management Coordinator supports waste generators. This
   support includes setting up proper satellite accumulation areas,
   preparing forms for waste characterization and disposal, serving as the
   primary contact for questions involving waste management regulations
   and waste minimization, maintaining Waste Profiles and waste disposal
   information, and ensuring that waste-related inspection deficiencies
   are corrected. The current Waste Management Coordinator is listed in
   Appendix A.

   g. ES&H Council

   The Group will have an ES&H Council. The membership of this Council
   includes, at a minimum, the Group Leader, Deputy Group Leader, ES&H
   Representative, HAZCOM Coordinator, ALARA Coordinator, Waste Management
   Coordinator, and the Electrical Safety Officer. The Group Leader or
   Deputy Group Leader is the head of the Council and may ask additional
   appropriate individuals to serve as members. The Council’s job is to
   review, discuss, and as necessary/appropriate take action on ES&H
   matters or issues within the group. The Council will meet at least
   twice a year. The Group Leader is responsible for conducting the
   meetings. Current Council members are listed in Appendix A.


   h. Supervisors/Mentors

   Supervisors (defined as any individual with the authority and
   responsibility to direct and authorize the activities of workers) have
   the responsibility for
   Defining the scope of the work;
       Ensuring that an effective hazard-control system is established to
       reduce the risk posed by the work to an acceptable level;
       A periodic review, at the division level, of the process used to
       assign and mitigate initial risk;
       Ensuring that institutional and facility requirements and
       restrictions on the work are followed;
       Understanding the work and associated hazard control system
       sufficiently to judge the acceptability of the residual risk prior
       to authorizing that work;
       Authorizing the defined work, when the risk has been controlled to
       an acceptable level;
       Ensuring that workers have the knowledge, skills, and abilities
       needed to perform the work safely;
       Authorizing workers to perform the work, when they have adequate
       knowledge, skills, and abilities;
       Ensuring that workers perform the work safely
       Improving the safety of the work by reviewing the work,
       commensurate with the level of risk, and ensuring the
       incorporations of lessons learned; and
       Ensuring that an appropriate change-control process is used to
       document and communicate changes made in the hazard-control system.

   i. Electrical Safety Officer

   The Group Electrical Safety Officer (GESO) is responsible for all
   electrical matters in the group. This includes approving all electrical
   work being performed by EES-1 qualified electrical workers.

   j. ES&H Person-In-Charge

   The Group Leader will appoint an ES&H person-in-charge for certain
   operations when the duration, remoteness, or level of effort warrants,
   in the judgment of the Group Leader, an on-site ES&H Representative.


   4. Safe Work Practices and Hazard Control Plans (HCPs).

   a. Existing Hazard Control Plans

   The group will conduct potentially hazardous activities in accordance
   with approved, written hazard control plans. Activities requiring HCPs
   will be identified through hazard assessments. Existing HCPs are:
   Rigaku 3064 Operation, HCP-EES-1-XRF-1
       Siemens
       q - q and q - 2q X-ray Diffraction Operations, HCP-EES-1-XRD-1
       INEL X-ray Diffractometer Operations, HCP-EES-1-XRD-2
       Scanning Electron Microscope Operations, HCP-EES-1-SEM-1
       Pressure Vessel Safety, HCP-EES-1-PRES-1
       Handling and Processing Samples containing Potentially Hazardous
       Fibrous Minerals, HCP-EES-1-FIB-1
       Low Temperature Asher & Tuning Transmitter, HCP-EES-1-LTA-1
       Microautoradiography
       Foreign Travel, HCP-EES-1-FT
       Computer Maintenance, HCP-EES-1-CM
       Office Work and Domestic Travel


   b. Hazard Control Plans for Field Operations

   EES-1 is involved in extensive field operations in the US and some
   foreign countries. AR 15-I defines field work as "the performance of
   Laboratory-related activities in areas that are removed or isolated
   from an established base of operations (that is, where emergency
   support and medical assistance are not readily available)." This work
   represents a wide variety of activities, each one with its unique set
   of conditions and hazards. Therefore, it is not possible to develop a
   generic field work HCP. To address this EES-1 provides guidance on the
   preparation of field work HCPs in Hazard Control Plans and standard
   Operating Procedures for Field Work. Copies of this document, and all
   other ES&H documents are available in the Group Office. The Group
   Leader is the approving authority for all minimal and low residual risk
   field operations. The EES Division Director is the approving authority
   for all medium residual risk field operations and all field operations
   conducted in foreign countries.

   c. Development of Hazard Control Plan

   When operations change significantly or new ones are to begin, a hazard
   assessment will be conducted following the guidance in LIR300-00-01.1,
   Safe Work Practices. HCPs will be prepared for all activities with
   medium or high initial risk. Subject-matter-experts will prepare a HCP
   for any other activity with low or minimal initial risk, if, in their
   judgement, and with the concurrence of the Group Leader, a HCP is
   needed. The HCPs will be prepared in accordance with LIR300-00-02.1,
   Documentation of Safe Work Practices.

   d. Annual Review of Hazard Control Plans and Standard Operating
   Procedures

   HCPs and SOPs will be reviewed at least once a year (unless specified
   otherwise) and revised as appropriate (see Change Control below). If
   changes are required, the HCP preparer will reissue the HCP as
   modified. If no changes are required only the HCP cover page will be
   updated. The Group ES&H Representative will be responsible for
   scheduling the reviews.

   e. Change Control

   Whenever the preparer/subject-matter expert determines that an existing
   HCP needs to be revised he or she will discuss the planned changes with
   the Group Leader. If the Group Leader concurs with the proposed
   changes, the HCP will be revised accordingly and reissued to all
   applicable workers. Each worker will sign a sign-off sheet indicating
   he or she has received the revised document and understand the changes
   that were made.


   5. Management Safety Walk-Arounds and Group Self Assessments

   The Group Leader and Deputy Group Leader will conduct monthly
   management walk-arounds in accordance with LIR307-01-03.1. The main
   focus will be communication from between the line manager and worker.
   Unsafe work practices or unsafe conditions will be identified.

   The group will conduct an annual ES&H self assessment of specific
   operations. The operations to be covered will be determined by the
   group ES&H council. The group ES&H assessment team will develop
   assessment criteria based on Laboratory administrative requirements,
   OSHA regulations, group SOPs, the group ES&H plan, and other
   appropriate requirements. These criteria will be used by the
   self-assessment team (consisting of the Group Leader, ES&H
   Representative, and, as appropriate, the Division ES&H Coordinator,
   staff members and/or lab technicians) to determine the degree of
   compliance with ES&H requirements. Deficiencies will be noted and
   summarized in an inspection report/action plan, which will identify the
   responsible person to correct the deficiencies and the corrective
   actions to be taken. The deficiency report will be completed by the
   group ES&H Representative and sent to the responsible persons and the
   Division ES&H Coordinator who will incorporate this deficiency report
   into a self assessment report to the Division Director. The Group ES&H
   Representative is responsible to ensure that all items are corrected
   and closed out.


   6. ES&H Meetings

   The primary purpose of ES&H meetings is to provide the appropriate ES&H
   information/ training to group employees, students, and visitors. These
   meetings may involve specific supervisors/mentors and their supervisees
   or the entire group, depending on the subject matter, ES&H issues will
   be the lead topic of every group meeting. The Group ES&H Representative
   will document all ES&H meetings in the ES&H file, including an
   attendance roster, an outline of topics covered, and a copy (or
   reference) of any material used for instruction, if appropriate. The
   Group Leader or Deputy Group Leader will meet with EES-1 employees who
   are absent from these meetings to discuss what they missed and have
   them sign and date the meeting roster.


   7. Personal Information Form

   A Personal Information form will be kept on file in the Group Office
   (Appendix B). These forms include information on each EES-1 employee to
   ensure that the Group has current information on whom to contact in the
   event of an accident, injury, or other emergency.


   8. ES&H Training and Programs

   a. ESH Division Training

   The line management and supervisors will ensure that all employees,
   students, and visitors receive the necessary ESH training. All training
   will be documented in the Laboratory Employee Development System
   database. Employees have the responsibility of scheduling their own
   training. The ES&H Representative will provide employees, supervisors,
   and mentors the names and telephone numbers of the appropriate training
   contacts in ES&H Division. Employees, students, and visitors and their
   supervisors/mentors share the responsibility to identify worker
   training needs as discussed earlier (see Section 3b). All new
   employees, students, and employees will receive General Employee
   Training (GET) before reporting to work.

   b. Other Training

   Training that may be necessary, but not offered by ES&H Division, will
   be planned and arranged for by the ES&H Representative. An example is
   survival training.

   c. Job-specific Training

   Supervisors are responsible for informing all new employees, students,
   and visitors on ES&H issues that pertain to their work area. They will
   be informed on the general and specific ES&H issues that may confront
   them in the immediate work place. All training shall be appropriate for
   the tasks that employees and visitors perform while at the site.
   Visitors without the appropriate level of training must be escorted at
   all times in hazardous facilities. Visitors who will be here for a
   short time and/or not using our equipment will receive only a verbal
   caution on the hazards in the area they visit. In a walk-through of the
   work area supervisors/mentors will point out safety features, such as
   locations of the fire extinguishers and exits, and the potential
   hazards that may exist in the area. They will brief the new employees
   and visitors on the general safety precautions to be followed and the
   hazardous materials that exist. Supervisors will give new workers
   copies of the Group ES&H Plan, Laboratory ES&H Handbook, and
   appropriate HCPs and SOPs that relate to the work they will be doing.

   Job-specific training must address at least the following topics, as
   appropriate and applicable, for the site and or the visitor: hazards
   and control measures, security procedures, workplace procedures, area
   warning lights and alarms, and emergency response. Supervisors will use
   the group checklist (Appendix C) as a guide to familiarize employees,
   students, and visitors with the work area and identify their training
   requirements. Individuals using the analytical facilities will also
   have an Analytical Laboratory ES&H Checklist completed for them (see
   Appendix D). When this indoctrination is complete, the checklist will
   be signed by the supervisor and the worker and approved by the Group
   Leader. Thereafter, the Group Leader, Deputy Group Leader, or
   supervisor will meet with each employee, student, or visitor as needed
   (at least annually during the performance appraisal process) to
   determine the job-specific individual training or knowledge that
   individuals need to do their jobs safely. This includes training
   requirements identified in hazard or self assessments or the initiation
   of new or modified operations. The supervisor/mentor who identifies
   such training will inform the employee/student/visitor of the training
   that is required. For training offered by ES&H Division, employees will
   schedule their own training. Mentors will schedule training of all
   students and visitors. The ES&H Representative will assist with
   scheduling training for students and visitors when requested by a
   mentor.

   d. Dosimetry Programs

   In accordance with LIR402-706-01.1, Personnel Dosimetry, EES-1
   personnel will be enrolled in the TLD badge and bioassay dosimetry
   programs as appropriate and applicable. The Employee Health Physics
   Checklist (Form 1528) will be completed and submitted to ESH-12 to
   enroll individuals in the dosimetry programs. Prior to enrollment into
   a dosimetry program personnel must attend GERT and may be required to
   also take RadWorker I and/or RadWorker II depending on their
   activities.

   e. Training Plans

   The Group Leader will ensure that the Laboratory Employee Development
   Training Plans include all applicable and appropriate training. The
   Group ES&H Representative will maintain the training plans and ensure
   that all EES-1 personnel and their respective supervisor/mentor are
   kept informed of their training status.


   9. Laboratory Operations

   a. Equipment Usage

   The EES-1 laboratories have instruments and sample preparation
   equipment that require individuals to be properly trained in their use,
   maintenance, and associated safety issues. The supervisor/mentor of new
   employees, students, and visitors who intend to use equipment in the
   laboratories will have the applicable laboratory custodian(s) provide
   training on the equipment that is to be used and authorize activities
   with minimal residual risk verbally. For equipment operations with low
   residual risk the laboratory technician will notify the Group
   Leader/Deputy Group Leader that the individual is fully qualified to
   perform the work and the Group Leader/Deputy Group Leader will inform
   the worker in writing (generally e-mail) that he or she is authorized
   to perform the activity. The Group Leader/Deputy Group Leader will also
   review each item on the Laboratory ES&H Checklist for New Employees and
   Visitors (Appendix D) with them. The completed checklist will be signed
   by the supervisor, the new employee/visitor, and Group Leader/Deputy
   Group Leader and placed in that person's personnel file.

   b. X-Ray Safety

   Supervisors and mentors will ensure workers involved in X-ray analysis
   have the appropriate training and follow the correct procedures to
   operate and control our X-ray equipment. This will be done through
   SOPs, equipment operating instructions, emergency response plans, and
   X-ray radiation training. To monitor for possible exposure, workers in
   the analytical labs with X-ray generating equipment will wear dosimeter
   badges. The ALARA Coordinator will transmit (confidentially) the
   results of the monitoring program to any worker with a reading greater
   than zero. The ES&H Representative will transmit (in confidence) the
   personal data summary annual report to each worker in the program.

   c. HAZCOM

   The person in charge of each analytical laboratory will maintain an
   inventory of hazardous materials present in the work area. This
   inventory, the material safety data sheets for these materials and the
   OSHA standard 1910.1200 will be available in the "Right-to-Know" area
   of the lab. The ES&H Representative will maintain an annual inventory
   for each laboratory, provided by the HAZCOM Coordinator, in the ES&H
   file. Supervisors will ensure that training is given to their
   employees, students, and visitors in the safe use (handling, toxicity,
   health effects, and disposal) of these materials. This training will be
   part of the training records for each worker.

   d. Energized Electrical Work

   Following the Laboratory Electrical Safety program LIR402-600-01.1 and
   LIG402-600-01, only those workers qualified by education, training, and
   experience may perform work on energized electrical parts. The EES-1
   Group Leader and ESH-5 authorize qualified persons to perform work.
   Appendix E, EES-1 Energized Electrical Work Requirements outlines the
   specific steps required for energized electrical work in EES-1.


   10. Emergency Response

   The Group Leader will ensure that employees, students, and visitors
   know appropriate responses to credible emergencies. This will be done
   through guidance within the group and by developing HCPs, SOPs, SWPs,
   and hazard assessments; CPR, first aid, hazard communication, and field
   survival training; and site-specific evacuation maps. The Group ES&H
   Representative will ensure that site emergency evacuation maps are
   posted in appropriate rooms and review them annually.


   11. Accident/Incident Reporting

   Each significant accident or facility incident will be reported
   following the EES Division notification procedure, See Appendix F. A
   significant accident is any accident that requires medical treatment. A
   significant facility incident is one that exceeds the facility safety
   envelope, causes major damage or an environmental release, or a
   facility stand-down is declared.

   ANNEX 1 (Employee Safety Commitment Form) to APPENDIX C, (EES-1 New
   Employee and Visitor Checklist) to EES-1 GROUP ENVIRONMENT, SAFETY AND
   HEALTH PLAN

   Los Alamos

   National Laboratory


                         EMPLOYEE SAFETY COMMITMENT

   The first line of defense to ensure a safe work place is individual
   awareness and commitment to safe work practices. All work performed on
   the Laboratory site must have appropriate work planning and hazard
   analysis before the work begins. Established safety procedures must be
   followed meticulously.

   Each activity at the Laboratory will be performed using the following
   5-step approach:

   Plan the work
       Analyze the hazards
       Develop and implement controls to mitigate the hazards
       Perform the work safety after you have confirmed your readiness to
       do so
       Identify improvements to further enhance the safety of the
       operations

   If it comes to a choice between meeting programmatic commitments and
   doing work safely-safety always comes first.

   Peer review and assessment of procedures for new processes and new
   activities are necessary to anticipate potentially hazardous conditions
   and their consequences. If it every worker’s responsibility to stop
   work for "clear and imminent danger" or "hazardous conditions" that
   have not been adequately mitigated.

   If the work to be performed contains hazards not identified in current
   Special Operating Procedures, Special Work Permits or Laboratory
   practice guidelines, then the work must be designated as "not normal"
   and subject to the 5-step approach outlined above, and the procedures
   revised accordingly.

   I have reviewed the safety of my current operations with my supervisor.

   I commit to use the 5-step approach to conducting work safely, now and
   in the future.

   I recognize that safety is my personal responsibility.

   I commit to employ safe work practices in everything I do at the
   Laboratory.
   I commit to follow approved and applicable procedures that I have been
       trained to perform.
