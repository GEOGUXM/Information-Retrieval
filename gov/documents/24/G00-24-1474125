      Education is the key to living safely with fire, reducing the
      destruction caused by wildland fires, and appreciating and preserving
      the natural resources that surround us. The California Department of
      Forestry and Fire Protection has a long history of providing fire
      prevention, fire safety, and natural resource information to the
      citizens and visitors of this State.
      CDF's Education Programs come in the form of school programs, fair
      exhibits, posters, flyers and thousands of other printed materials,
      radio and television spots, community meetings, one-on-one contact with
      wildland homeowners, and now the Internet. On these pages you will find
      information that will help keep your home and family fire safe and
      instill an appreciation of the beautiful natural resources of
      California.


   Education efforts pay off when homes survive wildland fires because
                                homeowners took fire safe precautions.

      For more information contact your nearest CDF facility and speak to a
      fire prevention officer or forester.
