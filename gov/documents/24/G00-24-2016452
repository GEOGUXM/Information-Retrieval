How to search for stuff in The Mission and Spacecraft Library

   Information contained in The Mission and Spacecraft Library can be
   accessed by simply browsing our index pages, or through a database
   serach. The search algorithms for the QuickLooks, Launch Facts, and
   Orbit Ephemeris Data, while fairly self-explanatory, each have their
   own nuances, so don't feel shy about reading the instructions below.

QuickLooks Pages

   Finding the QuickLook page(s) you are looking for can be accomplished
   in two ways: by browsing through one of several Quicklooks indexes and
   choosing what you like, or by searching for keywords.
     * Indices - Two indices currently exist to help guide you through the
       QuickLook pages - one sorted alphabetically by spacecraft name, and
       one sorted by mission category. There's also an alphabetical
       listing of all program pages contained in MSL. Each of these
       indices is updated whenever new material is added to the Library.
       Simply select the index you'd like, browse through the index to
       find the spacecraft you want, and click on a link to get more
       information. It's that simple...
     * QuickLook Search - The QuickLook Search scans through the text of
       all QuickLook and Program pages to find matches for a specified
       keyword. In a few seconds, you'll receive a page containing a list
       of all files that contained a match to the keyword, with hypertext
       links. To initiate a QuickLook Search, simply enter the keyword
       you'd like to find in the QuickLook Search box on the MSL Home
       page, and hit "Go!". Our computer does the rest...

Launch Facts

   Information in the Launch Facts database is accessed via a form used to
   specify parameters for a database search routine. This form has 8
   different selectable parameters, including Spacecraft Name, Spacecraft
   Mass, Launch Year, Orbit Class, Organization, Launch Site, Mission
   Type, and Launch Vehicle. After submitting a query with the desired
   parameter(s), our search algorithm will return a page containing all
   available data for each spacecraft meeting the query criteria. Plus, if
   the spacecraft has an associated QuickLook page, a hypertext link will
   be provided to the QuickLook.

   A description of each of the search parameters follows:

     * Spacecraft Name - the name of the spacecraft you wish to find.
       However, because labeling conventions for satellite names are not
       always consistent, e.g. some people use roman numbers while others
       use arabic characters, the search may not always find what you are
       looking for. If initially unsuccessful, try variations on the name,
       or use a subset of the name, e.g. look for "Intelsat" instead of
       "Intelsat 5 F3". One other note: spacecraft are sometimes renamed
       after reaching orbit, so you may need to find the latest
       designation for the spacecraft you're looking for.
     * Spacecraft Mass - the minimum or maximum mass of the spacecraft you
       wish to find. Right now, the search algorithm can only perform
       searches for masses greater than or less than a specified value.
       Depending on user feedback, searching for masses in a range of
       values may be implemented.
     * Launch Year - the year the spacecraft was launched.
     * Orbit Class - the general orbit category in which the spacecraft
       operated. Definitions of the orbit classes are given in the
       glossary. For spacecraft which changed orbit during flight, the
       orbit class is the one where the spacecraft spent most of the time,
       or performed most of its mission (e.g. a geostationary commsat
       would be listed in GEO, despite the fact that it may have started
       in a LEO or HEO parking/transfer orbit).
     * Organization - the organization which owns and operates the
       satellite. In many cases satellites are owned by national space
       agencies, and are listed by country. In cases where a satellite is
       privately owned, the private corporation is listed as the
       controlling organization. Where ownership of a satellite is
       uncertain or unknown, the country which launched the satellite is
       listed.
     * Launch Site - the place the satellite was launched from.
     * Mission Type - the general type of mission performed by the
       satellite. A list of the different mission types, and definitions
       for each type, are given in the glossary.
     * Launch Vehicle - the launch vehicle used to place the satellite
       into orbit. For satellites deployed from an already orbiting
       spacecraft, the launch vehicle originally used to launch the
       deploying spacecraft (not the deploying spacecraft itself) is
       listed.
