                Gas Scintillation Proportional Counter - GSPC

   We have developed high-pressure Gas Scintillation Proportional Counters
   (GSPC) for the focus of a balloon-borne hard-x-ray telescope. The
   device has a total active diameter of 50 mm, of which the central 20 mm
   only is used, and is filled with xenon + 4% helium at a total pressure
   of 106 Pa giving a quantum efficiency of greater than 85% up to 60 keV.
   The detector entrance is sealed with a beryllium window, 3-mm thick,
   which provides useful transmission down to 6 keV, well below the
   atmospheric cut-off at balloon float altitudes. Scintillation light
   exits the detector via a UV transmitting window in its base and is
   registered by a Hamamatsu position-sensitive crossed-grid-readout
   photomultiplier tube.

   Further information (published in SPIE, PDF format) on the initial
   testing and preliminary measurements of light yield, energy resolution
   and spatial resolution show that a spatial resolution of 0.5 mm FWHM or
   better should be achievable up to 60 keV, and this is well matched to
   the angular resolution and plate scale of the mirror system. The energy
   resolution has been measured to be around 5% at 22 keV. A paper in PDF
   format on in-flight cosmic-ray background simulations is also
   available.
