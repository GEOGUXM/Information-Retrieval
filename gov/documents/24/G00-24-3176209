                        Welcome to the NCI Metaphrase
                        Desktop Metathesaurus Browser

   Have you ever been unable to recall quite how to spell a biomedical
   term?  Or been unable to recall a specific term, although you can
   recall related terms?  Or have you  needed to find a code in a medical
   vocabulary with which you are unfamiliar?  If you have, you have come
   to the right place!

   This Web page enables you to search dozens of biomedical vocabularies
   for terms or for codes, to discover which terms or codes correspond to
   each other in different vocabularies, and much more.  The page is a
   service of the NCI Center for Bioinformatics, and is intended to meet
   the needs of NCI staff and business partners.

   Refer to the NCI Metaphrase User's Guide to for help in getting the
   most out of this page.

   For those interested in technical details, this page is produced by a
   Java servlet that accesses a vocabulary server called Metaphrase^TM,^ ^
   which in turn is running in front of an Oracle database containing the
   NCI Metathesaurus.  Metaphrase^TM is off-the-shelf commercial software
   that NCI has licenses from Apelon, Inc.  NCI Metathesaurus is a
   comprehensive biomedical terminology database, currently containing
   850,000 concepts mapped to 1,500,000 terms by over 4,500,000
   relationships.  NCI Metathesaurus is produced by the NCI Center for
   Bioinformatics Enterprise Vocabulary Service.  The NCI Metathesaurus
   currently contains all public domain vocabularies from the National
   Library of Medicine's UMLS Metathesaurus, plus several proprietary
   vocabularies that NCI has licensed  for its internal use, and a growing
   number of NCI-specific vocabularies developed by NCI.
