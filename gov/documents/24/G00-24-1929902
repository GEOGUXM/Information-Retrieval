   Federal Regulator Often Helps Banks Fighting Consumers --- Dependent on
                                Lenders' Fees
                       by Jess Bravin and Paul Beckett

     When a federal appeals court in San Francisco took up the issue of
   automated-teller-machine fees earlier this month, it sparked the latest
            round in the battle between big banks and customers.

    Sticking up for consumers were the cities of San Francisco and Santa
    Monica. They had banned certain ATM fees, after customers complained
     about being gouged when they use ATMs belonging to banks other than
    their own. Defending the fees were California's two largest banks --
   Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. -- which had won at trial.

    Also in the courtroom: the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
    the federal banking regulator. But in this case -- as in more than a
      dozen others in recent years -- the OCC wasn't there to check the
    economic power of banking titans. Instead, the regulator was helping
   the nationally chartered banks defend their fees. The appeals court is
                     expected to rule in coming months.

    Many federal regulators have a clear mandate to put consumers first.
    The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, refers to itself
                        as "the investor's advocate."

    It's less clearcut for the federal banking watchdog. Time and again,
    the U.S. agency that bank customers might assume is on their side has
    lined up with banks to fight state and local measures that purport to
                               aid consumers.

    In addition to the ATM-fees case in California, the OCC recently has
      supported banks in their effort to kill a ban in Texas on certain
      check-cashing fees. In Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, the OCC has
     weighed in on the side of giant FleetBoston Financial Corp. against
   consumer allegations of improper increases in credit-card rates. And in
   Michigan, the federal agency has even supported a push by banks making
      auto loans to curb a state law aimed at unscrupulous car dealers.

     The OCC's solicitousness toward the businesses it oversees stems in
       part from its need to compete for their loyalty. In an uncommon
   arrangement, banks can choose either a state or federal regulator, and
     the selection has financial consequences: The OCC and state banking
     departments subsist entirely on fees paid by the institutions they
                                  regulate.

   The competition, though discreet, can get intense. As consolidation has
    swept the industry, the OCC's once-mighty position has slipped. Since
     1990, as the number of U.S. banks dropped 31%, to 8,300, the number
    regulated by the OCC dropped 45%, to about 2,230. It still regulates
         the bulk of the banking industry as measured by assets, but
    consolidation has made the agency increasingly dependent on a few big
    players. Third-ranking Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., now
   pays $40 million a year to the OCC in fees, or the equivalent of 10% of
                  the agency's annual $400 million budget.

     The OCC promises federally chartered banks the predictability of a
   uniform set of rules, rather than the burden of complying with varying
   state standards. A further attraction is the likelihood that the agency
    will support its banks in court against aggressive state regulators.
    State banking authorities typically offer the competing enticement of
                           lower examination fees.

      The OCC, an arm of the Treasury Department with 2,900 employees,
         maintains that it safeguards customers by enforcing federal
     consumer-protection laws and by securing the overall health of the
     national banking system. But the agency's chief, John D. Hawke Jr.,
    says that state efforts to stick up for bank customers often threaten
    to undermine the right of national banks under federal law to operate
                      and charge fees as they see fit.

   The OCC's siding with banks in court fights "may operate in some cases
   to the disadvantage of consumers," says Mr. Hawke, a 68-year-old lawyer
   who in private practice represented both state- and federally chartered
    banks. But his agency "can't pick and choose whether a [state] law or
    action is good or bad" for consumers. If it cramps banks' freedom to
            operate in the eyes of the OCC, it must go, he says.

   History helps explain the OCC's stance. It was founded during the Civil
       War to oversee newly created national banks that were formed to
       circulate a national currency and finance the Union's military
    campaign. With strong backing from the federal courts, the OCC still
    interprets the National Bank Act of 1863 as authorizing it to oppose
       any state or municipal attempt to interfere with the ability of
   nationally chartered banks to engage in "the business of banking." When
      the agency goes to court, it also invokes a provision in the U.S.
   Constitution stating that federal law prevails in conflicts with state
                                    law.

   Frustrated consumers say the upshot is that the OCC favors the industry
   that pays its bills. "The individual bank customer is just no equal of
    the large banking institutions," says David Buda, an attorney in Fort
   Lee, N.J., who has complained unsuccessfully to the OCC about increases
     in the interest rate on his FleetBoston credit card. If "your only
     avenue is to complain to the comptroller of the currency, then all
   you're going to get is a form letter saying, `We can't help you,' " Mr.
                                 Buda adds.

   Other federal regulators operate differently. The SEC budget comes from
      fees from securities exchanges and publicly traded companies. But
   unlike banks, those companies don't have a choice of regulator, so the
    SEC isn't competing for their loyalty. About 12% of the Food and Drug

     Administration's budget comes from industry fees. The Federal Trade
                     Commission is funded by taxpayers.

    During tough economic times, the bank-regulatory setup comes under a
    brighter spotlight. Consumers find it harder to keep up financially.
     Banks, faced with rising loan losses, seek additional revenue with
     moves such as fee hikes on credit cards -- making it that much more
    likely that consumers will seek help from the federal bank regulator.

       Mr. Hawke, who was appointed by President Clinton in 1998 to a
   five-year term, says he spends time both looking out for consumers and
       seeking to defend his regulatory turf. In 1999, he introduced a
    12-minute video the OCC distributes to banks called "The Value of the
   National Bank Charter." In it, he describes "how the OCC and a national
        charter can help banking organizations achieve their goals."

         Sometimes, he makes personal appeals. In August 1999, when
   state-chartered AmSouth Bancorp of Birmingham, Ala., was in the process
    of buying OCC-chartered First American Corp. of Nashville, Tenn., Mr.
    Hawke flew to visit C. Dowd Ritter, AmSouth's chief executive. After
    exchanging pleasantries, Mr. Hawke reached into his briefcase to show
    Mr. Ritter a copy of a federal bank charter issued in 1884 to one of
                        AmSouth's predecessor banks.

    "This is something I thought you would like to see," Mr. Hawke said,
   according to Stephen Yoder, AmSouth's general counsel, who attended the
       meeting. "We have something in Washington that is part of your
                                  history."

    Despite the imaginative appeal, AmSouth rebuffed Mr. Hawke, retaining
    its Alabama state charter after the merger. The bank says it already
              had a good relationship with its state regulator.

   Mr. Hawke, who confirms the account, says that losing market share "is
   a matter of concern to us." But he stresses the OCC takes seriously its
     responsibility to protect consumers. He occasionally makes speeches
   chastising bankers for such practices as selling confidential customer
     information to telemarketing firms. And the agency enforces about a
    dozen federal consumer laws, including the Truth in Lending and Fair
     Credit Reporting Acts. Typically, the OCC enforces compliance with
      those laws during its routine bank examinations, agency spokesman
                            Robert Garsson says.

    Earlier this month, as the result of an examination, the OCC ordered
    Eagle National Bank, a small institution in Upper Darby, Pa., to get
      out of the business of funding so-called payday loans. These are
   high-interest loans repayable on the borrower's next payday and viewed
      by many regulators as exploitative. The OCC said it acted because
       Eagle's lack of oversight of the loans had placed its financial
                             viability at risk.
