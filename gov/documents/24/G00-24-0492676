                           ST. LOUIS METROPOLITAN
                             FUGITIVE TASK FORCE

     The top priority for the St. Louis FBI is to address and reduce
     violent crimes that afflict the citizens that we are sworn to
     protect. To rid the streets of the most violent felons, the FBI has
     joined with officers from the St. Louis Metropolitan Police
     Department, the St. Louis County Police Department, the Jefferson
     County Sheriff's Office, and the Missouri Highway Patrol to form the
     St. Louis Metropolitan Fugitive Task Force.
     History:
     The Violent Crimes and Omnibus Crimes Control Act of 1991 made
     federal funds available for the purpose of Safe Streets Task Forces.
     The purpose of the Safe Streets Initiative was to combine the
     efforts of federal, state and local agencies in an effort to stop
     violent felons from operating a criminal empire or continuing to
     conduct criminal activity (but did not expand federal authority in
     local criminal matters). St. Louis has two Safe Streets Task Forces,
     one to address the problem of gangs, and one to address fugitive
     matters, which is known as the St. Louis Metropolitan Fugitive Task
     Force (SLMFTF).
     The FBI has worked with local law enforcement in the St. Louis area
     for many years to address violent crimes. The SLMFTF was implemented
     to maintain a more cohesive force to address the most dangerous
     felons.  The SLMFTF was brought into one unit, under one roof and
     one command structure on February 19, 1997.
     Mission:
     The mission of the task force is to locate and apprehend violent
     fugitives; with a particular interest in felons who are at-large and
     who pose the most significant danger to the community by
     perpetrating the most egregious criminal conduct. Therefore, this
     unit is tasked with apprehending the most dangerous and
     difficult-to-locate criminals in the St. Louis area.

     Each federal officer has been cross-designated as a peace officer in
     the state of Missouri, and likewise, each local officer has been
     designated as a Special Deputy U.S. Marshal to provide them with
     federal authority.

     Fugitives sought by the SLMFTF must meet specific criteria. These
     criteria include an active warrant and,
     * believed or known to be a member of a violent street gang and/or;
     * have a documented history of violence and/or;
     * have committed a particularly dangerous violent act; threats to
       commit such an act or intimidating witnesses in a criminal action
       through force or violence and/or;
     * the warrant in these cases may be for lesser or nonviolent
       offenses, but cases will be worked if there is information to
       believe that the criminal is acting with others, or controlling a
       criminal enterprise that commits acts of violence or facilitates
       violent acts (such as a street gun dealer).

     The task force has enjoyed great success. While focusing on the most
     violent and difficult fugitives to capture, the SLMFTF has arrested
     over 500 fugitives in one year. These persons have been charged with
     murder, rape, sodomy, child molestation and many other violent
     charges.

     If you have information concerning the location of any individual
     you believe is wanted by law enforcement authorities, please
     telephone the FBI at (314) 589-2500.  All information provided will
     be kept confidential.
