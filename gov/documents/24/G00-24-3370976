   Combined LEP claim of Higgs excess (Jul 01)

Search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson at LEP

Authors: ALEPH,DELPHI, L3, OPAL, and the LEP Higgs Working Group
Report-no: LHWG Note/2001-03

The four LEP collaborations, ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, have
collected 2465 pb-1 of e+e- collision data at energies between 189 and
209 GeV, of which 542 pb-1 were collected above 206 GeV. Searches for
the Standard Model Higgs boson have been performed by each of the LEP
collaborations. Their data have been combined and examined for their
consistency with the Standard Model background and various Standard
Model Higgs boson mass hypotheses. A lower bound of 114.1 GeV has been
obtained at the 95% confidence level for the mass of the Higgs
boson. The likelihood analysis shows a preference for a Higgs boson
with a mass of 115.6 GeV. At this mass, the probability for the
background to generate the observed effect is 3.5%.

   From: Harvey Newman
   Subject: Announcement of the End of LEP
   Dear Colleagues,

   The CERN DG has decided to shut down LEP definitively, and to submit
   this recommendation to the CERN Council. You may be interested in the
   enclosed Press Release.

   Physicists in the LEP experiments are continuing to discuss the
   possibility of extending the run, to clarify the evidence for a Higgs
   boson at approximately 115 GeV. Dismantling will not start until the
   Council has approved DG Maini's recommendation.

   LEP had an illustrious eleven years. On to LHC, and great physics at
   CMS. best regards,

   Harvey Newman

   CERN press release: LEP run extended to Nov 2, 2000.

   Quotations:
     * "a number of events compatible with a Higgs boson production with
       mass around 114-115 GeV was reported in the combined results of the
       four LEP experiments, ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL. However, the
       topology of these events is also compatible with originating from
       other known standard model processes."
     * "The extension. the maximum still compatible with the tight LHC
       construction schedule, will effectively double the experimental
       data at centre-of-mass energy above 206 GeV."

   Combined LEP result for 4-jet events: (page 13 of Higgs Working Group
   Talk to LEPC 9-5-00)

   If you only look at one plot, this is the one to look at: Plot.

   This plot compares the data with Monte Carlo prediction of the
   background and Higgs signal assuming a 114 GeV Standard Model Higgs.
   The data are shown three times with cuts tightened to give
   Signal/Background of 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0. For the last case the result is
     * 12 data events, 5 expected background and 2 expected Higgs events.

   If one restricts the data to reconstructed masses above 110 GeV then
   there are
     * 7 data events, 2 expected background and 2 expected Higgs events.

   Recall that Fermilab claims that they can discover the Higgs in Run II
   if the mass is less than 135 GeV.

   Presentations to LEPC (LEP Experiments Committee) Sept 5, 2000:
     * Higgs Working Group
     * (1)Aleph see pages 8-26
     * (2)Delphi see pages 8-21
     * (3)Opal see pages 11-17
     * (4)L3 see pages 4-9

   At the LEPC meeting, Aleph and Delphi claimed and excess, L3 claimed no
   excess and Opal did not claim an excess (because they don't have one).

   (1)Aleph Presentation to LEPC on Sept. 5, 2000.

   Higgs evidence: pages 8-26. Pages 20, 25, and 26 contain the gist of
   the evidence.

   ALEPH tightens their cuts on the Standard Model Higgs search and
   observes 3 events with an expected background of only 0.3. They only
   expect 0.6 from the Higgs, so either they got lucky, the Higgs has a
   larger cross-section than expected or this is a fluctuation in the
   background. The signal events are also consistent with the hypothesis
   that they come from ZZ events (i.e. background).

   All three signal candidates are four jet events. LEP produces Higgs by
   e+e- -> Z and the Z boson then radiates a Higgs so you have a Z and
   Higgs final state. The light Higgs would preferentially decay to two b
   jets. The Z will decay to a pair of jets, or a pair of leptons. LEP is
   running at a center of mass energy of 206.5 GeV. So if this is a Higgs,
   then it would have a mass of about 114 GeV.

   Report from Vuko Brigljevic (Sep. 5, 2000)
     * The 3 other LEP experiments do not see any excess.
     * The LEP run has been extended until at least end of September (it
       should be finishing this week according to first plans).
     * They are thinking about extensions until the end of the year (2000)
       but the decision is quite hard because:
          + After October 1st, they will have to pay some significant
            money for every delayed day: according to contracts made with
            construction companies, they were supposed to start then and
            the companies of course want their money.
          + it may delay LHC by a year.
     * The news about a possible Higgs signal came big in the local
       (non-scientific) papers here, far exagerating what is really
       happening (as usual).
