                              Form Requirements
     __________________________________________________________________

   Any instrument presented for recording must satisfy the following
   conditions pursuant to Arizona Revised Statute 11-480

   11-480 . Requirements for form of instruments

   A. Only an instrument which upon presentation to a county recorder for
   recordation fails to meet any of the following conditions may be
   rejected for recordation at the time of presentation for recordation:

     1. Each instrument shall have a caption briefly stating the nature
     of the instrument, such as warranty deed, release of mortgage,
     notice of bulk sale and like captions. The county recorder shall
     have no obligation to index any instrument under any subject index
     category maintained by the county recorder unless that category is
     included in the caption to the instrument.

     2. Each instrument shall be an original or a copy of the original
     and shall be sufficiently legible for the recorder to make certified
     copies from the photographic or micrographic record. (Unless
     otherwise required by law ie. death certificates & judgments)

     3. Each instrument shall have original signatures or carbon copies
     of such signatures, except when otherwise provided by law.

     4. Each instrument dated and executed on or after January 1, 1991,
     shall be no larger than eight and one-half inches in width and no
     longer than fourteen inches and shall have a print size no smaller
     than ten point type.

   B. Each instrument dated and executed on or after January 1, 1991,
   shall have at least a one-half inch margin across the top, bottom and
   the left and right sides from the top to the bottom. Any markings,
   entries or text which are within the one-half inch margin shall be
   deemed not to impart the notice otherwise imparted by recordation
   unless such markings, entries or text appear in the reproduction
   produced under the direction and control of the county recorder.
   Failure to meet the one-half inch margin requirement of this subsection
   may affect notice imparted by the document but shall not constitute
   grounds for rejection for recordation pursuant to subsection A.

   C. The first page shall have a top margin of at least two inches which
   shall be reserved for recording information. The left three and
   one-half inches of the top margin of the first page or sheet may be
   used by the public to show the name of the person requesting recording
   and the name and address to which the document is to be returned
   following recording. If the first page of the instrument does not
   comply with the top margin requirements, a separate sheet that meets
   the requirement and that reflects the title of the document as required
   by subsection A, paragraph 1 shall be attached to the front of the
   document by the party requesting recording.

   D. Any instrument presented to a county recorder for recordation which
   modifies in any way the provisions of a previously recorded document
   must state the date of recordation and the docket and page of the
   document being modified.

   E. Any instrument accepted for recordation is not subject to a later
   claim of invalidity for failure to comply with the requirements of this
   section.
