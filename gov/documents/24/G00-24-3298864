                         Icing Research Tunnel (IRT)

   The Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) is Glenn's oldest and busiest facility.
   Built at the end of World War II, the IRT was instrumental in
   developing and testing ice protection systems for piston- and
   propeller-driven aircraft. Since that time, the IRT has been updated
   with a larger fan motor, improved fan blades, computerized tunnel
   controls, and electronic data acquisition, storage, and processing.

   The IRT has played a substantial role in developing, testing, and
   certifying methods to prevent ice buildup on gas-turbine-powered
   aircraft. Work continues today in the investigation of low-power
   electromechanical deicing and anti-icing fluids for use on the ground,
   deicing and anti-icing research on STOVL rotor systems and
   certification of ice protection systems for military and commercial
   aircraft.
   The IRT can produce continuous airspeeds from 50 to 400 mph and
   temperatures as low as -40F year-round, controllable to within one
   degree Fahrenheit. Supercooled water droplets between 15 and 40 mm with
   water content controllable between 0.5 and 2.5g/m3 can be produced to
   form an icing cloud. The 6 ft high, 9 ft wide, 20 ft long test section
   can accommodate many full-sized aircraft components as well as
   large-scale models and an 8.6 ft diameter turntable in the test section
   can rotate horizontally +/-20 degrees for various angles of attack.
