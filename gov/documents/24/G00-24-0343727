Introduction

   Extensions to the basic FITS format can be defined as specified in
   Grosb√∏l et al. (Astron. Astrophys. Suppl. 73, p359-364, 1988). The IAU
   FITS Working Group (WG) under Commission 5 registers the names of such
   conforming extensions. The status of a given extension can have one of
   the following levels:
   Status   Remarks
  ___________________________________________________________________________

     S      Standard FITS extension accepted by the IAU FITS WG
            and recommended by the IAU.

     P      Proposal for FITS extension accepted by local FITS
            committees but not yet by the IAU FITS WG.

     D      Draft proposal to be discussed in local FITS commitees.

     R      Reserved FITS extension name for which a full draft proposal
            has not yet been submitted.
