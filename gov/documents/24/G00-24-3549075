   IPRT's industrial-outreach programs serve as catalysts to identify and
   meet the needs of manufacturers and entrepreneurs in the state of
   Iowa.
     * Iowa Companies Assistance Program (ICAP)
     * Iowa Demonstration Laboratory (IDL)
     * Center for Advanced Technology Development/Iowa Industrial
       Incentive Program (IIP)
     * IPRT Technical Assistance Request

   The wide range of technologies available through the IPRT centers and
   through Iowa State University allows us to provide a wide variety of
   services, from technical coaching to nonroutine product testing,
   design, and beyond. We provide Iowa companies direct access to ISU's
   expertise, research capabilities, and laboratories outfitted with the
   latest equipment. Help is available from a variety of sources, from the
   IPRT centers to ISU academic departments.
   IPRT's outreach programs are customer-oriented. IPRT and ISU want to
   enhance Iowa's economic development by helping Iowa companies retain
   current jobs and create new jobs, and by helping Iowans start new
   companies.
   If you have a technical problem, want to improve your product or a
   manufacturing process, or have a new product idea, please contact the
   IPRT Industrial Liaison.
   At ISU and at IPRT, you will find a commitment to Iowa industry.
