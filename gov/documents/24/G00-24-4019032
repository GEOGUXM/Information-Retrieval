   Classroom Internet Integration
   One important goal of EDSITEment is to help educators integrate the
   Internet as a standard classroom resource. Once you tap into this
   seemingly boundless source of ideas, new experiences, and information,
   you will recognize that it holds a unique potential for inspiring real
   intellectual curiosity in your students and for stimulating
   multidimensional intellectual growth.

   You can use the Internet to:
     * Create increased sharing of the responsibility for learning among
       students and teachers.
     * Engage students in authentic tasks, designed to help them
       understand how scholars, for example, use primary materials to
       interpret events or human interaction or expressions.
     * Encourage students to work in teams, sparking questions and ideas
       off of each other, offering them an experience similar to
       modern-day practices in the workplace.
     * Enhance students' natural curiosity and love of exploration.
     * Stimulate analytical and synthetic thinking.
     * Train students to evaluate primary materials, develop and defend
       hypotheses with evidence, and comprehend and interpret texts and
       ideas.
     * Teach analysis of maps, pictures, and other visual representations
       to understand people, places, environments, and cultures.
     * Enhance foreign language learning by providing easily accessible
       authentic language and cultural materials.
     * Enhance written expressions as students seek to communicate with
       each other and to "publish" their ideas on web pages of their own.
