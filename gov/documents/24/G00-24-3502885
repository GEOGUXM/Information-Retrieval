Object Names

   Due to the rather small size of the CIO's object name field, the name
   formats of the CIO may not always match conventional usage. Some
   examples of common names and their CIO non-standard equivalents are:

           Common Name         CIO Name
   G (Gliese star)             GLIESE
   HH (Herbig-Haro object)     H-H
   HR (Yale bright star)       BS
   MKN, MRK (Markarian galaxy) MARK

   To search for a bright star with a Greek letter name, look under the
   three-letter constellation abbreviation. Greek letters are represented
   by the abbreviations listed in the table below.
   Examples: ALF CEN (Alpha Centauri) is listed with the CEN names, NUU
   PEG (Nu Pegasi) can be found with the PEG names, and ZET ORI (Zeta
   Orionis) is listed under the ORI names.

Searching for Catalog Listings by Source Name

   Infrared sources in the Catalog are listed alphabetically by their base
   name (such as a constellation name) in the Source Atlas. Many sources
   may also have prefixes and/or suffixes as part of their name. Most
   source names appear in the Catalog in abbreviated form. These
   abbreviations are not always intuitive. For these reasons, it can
   sometimes be difficult to locate a source in the Catalog. However,
   sources can more easily be recognized by browsing the alphabetical name
   list in the Source Atlas which is part of this database.

   After clicking on the appropriate green button, a list of source names
   arranged alphabetically by base name is displayed. Clicking on a
   highlighted source name directs the search engine to that RA/Dec in the
   Catalog.

  The Source Atlas is arranged alphabetically by the base name

   For example, to find. . .

   SOURCE      Prefix Base Suffix    Click on:
   ------      ------ ---- ------    --------
   Alpha Sco    ALPHA SCO              "S"
   NGC 1068           NGC  1068        "N"
   3C 273           3 C    273         "C"
   I ZW 10          I ZW   10          "Z"

Positions

   Positions in the CIO are taken directly from the relevant articles. In
   some cases, positions are derived by the editors or obtained from
   SIMBAD or NED, but "homogeneous" positions are not used. Therefore,
   data for a given object may appear at a wide variety of locations.

   Positions can be entered in the formats shown on the search page and a
   search will be made for all objects within the indicated ranges, which
   can be widened or narrowed as desired. When entering positions, leading
   zeroes are required.

   The symbols >, <, >=, and <= can be used to return all objects with RA
   or Dec greater than or less than the value typed in the box. For these
   cases, any entries in the position search range boxes are ignored. For
   example, to display all objects 1 degree or less from the North
   Celestial Pole, enter ">=+89" (without the quotation marks) in the Dec
   text box and leave the RA text box blank.

   When the search is completed, clicking an object name enters BROWSE
   mode, which displays 25 records on either side of the selected record,
   allowing the user to check for more data of interest near that
   position.

     __________________________________________________________________

Position Ranges

   By default, positions are searched over a range of one second of right
   ascension and ten arcseconds of declination. To specify a different
   range, type the desired value in the text box, and select a unit from
   the drop down box. Decimal values, such as 0.5 arcminutes, are
   acceptable.
     __________________________________________________________________

Wavelengths

   Enter wavelength in units of microns (µm). The symbols >, <, >=, and <=
   can be used to return all records with wavelengths greater than or less
   than the value typed in the first box. To search for a range of
   wavelengths, enter the desired values in the FROM and TO boxes. If you
   enter values in both boxes, the search will be *NON-INCLUSIVE* of the
   values you enter. Some examples are shown below.

   CAPTION: ENTRY EXAMPLES

   To Return All Observations... Enter in the boxes...
   ...at 10 µm                   [rangesw.gif]
   ...between 2.2 - 12.4 µm,
   not including those values
   ...greater than 25 µm
   ...less than or equal to 5 µm

     __________________________________________________________________

Fluxes

   The two boxes can be used to restrict the search to a specific flux
   value or range of flux values. The symbols >, <, >=, and <= can be used
   to return all records with fluxes greater than or less than the value
   typed in the first box. To search for a range of fluxes, enter the
   desired values in the FROM and TO boxes. If you enter values in both
   boxes, the search will be *NON-INCLUSIVE* of the values you enter. (See
   examples in the table below.)

   NOTE: In the case of objects with magnitude measurements (units "M" and
   "C"), specifying a range of "greater than" (>) will return fainter
   values, and specifying a range of "less than" (<) will return brighter
   values.

   CAPTION: ENTRY EXAMPLES

   To Return All Observations...     Enter in the boxes...
   ...flux of 10                     [rangesf.gif]
   ...flux between 100 and 1000,
   not including those values
   ...flux greater than 1000
   ...flux less than or equal to 2.0

     __________________________________________________________________

Units

   By default, a query returns all flux units appearing in the catalog. If
   you wish to specify one or more units, check the appropriate box(es)
   and/or choose a unit from one or more of the drop-down boxes. For
   example, to see only fluxes given in units of magnitude, check the
   Magnitudes box. The result will include records with flux units "M" and
   "C" (magnitude derived from a color measurement).

   The overwhelming majority of the fluxes in the catalog were measured in
   Janskys or Magnitudes. To specify one of the other catalog units,
   highlight it in the appropriate drop-down box.

   Occasionally the flux unit will include the qualifier "V" (variable or
   the mean of several values measured at the same beam size), "L" (lower
   limit), "E" (editors determined flux from maps, spectra, or other
   non-tabulated material), or "U" (upper limit). Records with these
   qualifiers will be returned by default.

Bibliographic Reference Number

   The bibliographic reference number identifies the original journal
   article for each observation in the Catalog. The reference number is
   made up of the year and month of publication, and a sequential number
   which is assigned to the article (for example, "790104" breaks down
   into 79-01-04, where 79 = 1979, 01 = January, and 04 = article randomly
   assigned as #4 in that month). References that do not indicate the
   month of publication have "00" in the month field.
