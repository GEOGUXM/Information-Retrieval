   Good and welcome to my site.  I am thankful for the honor and the
   privilege of serving the great state of Ohio in the United States
   Senate. As the parents of eight children and the grandparents of six,
   my wife, Fran, and I care deeply about our world and the future we
   create for America's children. And so, as a member of the Senate I am
   working hard on the issues that are important to all of Ohio. Please
   continue to visit my website and learn more about those issues and my
   efforts to make our world safe, strong and secure for future
   generations.
