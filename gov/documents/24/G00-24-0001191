   The Visualization and Virtual Reality for Manufacturing project is a
   SIMA (Systems Integration for Manufacturing Automation) funded project
   that examines the role of advanced user interfaces for manufacturing
   applications. Over the years we have produced many examples of VRML for
   manufacturing and technology purposes.

   The objective of the VVRM project is to explore the feasibility of a
   range of tools and techniques that support advanced manufacturing.
     * Working Model 3D VRML output - conveyer, rings, log-machine, robot,
       airplane landing, piston, man falling, digger.
     * Deneb 3D VRML output - car work cell, BIFUR Kinematic Model,
       GRIPPER, Hexapod, RobotCrane, Assembly Line.
     * Anthropometric Landmark Glossary, standing body, wheelchair bound
       body, head
     * Greg Seidman's VRML2 Widgets
     * Kinematics 'R Us
     * Group Demo Building- a very large environment (~15Mb) illustrating
       many projects of the VUG Group.

   The VVRM project is a product of the Visualization and Usability Group,
   Information Access Division, Information Technology Laboratory of the
   National Institute of Standards and Technology.
