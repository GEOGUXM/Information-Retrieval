                      VICTIM WITNESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

   Federal crime victims and witnesses are entitled to certain rights.
   These rights are set forth in the Victim Rights and Restitution Act of
   1990, 42 U.S.C. Section 10606(b) which states, "A crime victim has the
   following rights:
     * to be treated with fairness and with respect, dignity and privacy;
     * to be reasonably protected from the accused offender;
     * to be notified of court proceedings;
     * to be present at all public proceedings related to the offense,
       unless the court determines that testimony by the victim would be
       materially affected if the victim heard other testimony;
     * to confer with an attorney for the Government in the case;
     * to restitution; and
     * to information about the conviction, sentencing, imprisonment and
       release of the offender;

   Victims who are children, or victims of sex offenses, domestic
   violence, or telemarketing crimes, have additional rights.

   The Victim Witness Assistance Program is designed to provide
   information about and referral to emergency medical and social services
   for the innocent victims (and their family members) of federal
   violations. As Federal law enforcement professionals, the employees of
   the FBI are concerned about the problems experienced by victims and
   witnesses of crime. A Federal investigation can be complex and lengthy.
   It may involve several agencies, both Federal and local. Many victims
   will have questions and the Victim Witness Assistance Program exists to
   help provide the answers.

   Under Federal law, a victim will be kept informed of the status of the
   case during the investigation. The FBI Victim Witness Specialist will
   also provide information regarding harassment and/or threats, financial
   help, assist with employers and creditors, and will advise of an arrest
   in the case. However, concurrently, we need cooperation throughout the
   investigation and any other proceedings. The Victim Witness Specialist
   is the principle contact during this segment of the criminal justice
   process.

   Victim-Witness Assistance is an essential part of FBI investigations
   because of the need to assist those persons who have suffered loss
   resulting from the commission of a federal crime. Assistance is
   provided to victims/witnesses whose cases have not yet reached
   indictment but need to be informed about essential issues such as
   filing deadlines for crime victim compensation claims. Contact your FBI
   Victim/Witness Specialist for further information.
