                       We are transportation planning.

   The Flagstaff Metropolitan Planning Organization (FMPO) is responsible
   for comprehensive transportation planning in the region extending from
    Bellemont to Winona and Sunset Crater to Kachina Village. Federal law
   requires the existence a metropolitan planning organization in order to
                   receive federal transportation funding.

      FMPO will assist its member organizations, the City of Flagstaff,
      Coconino County, and the Arizona Department of Transportation, in
    programming transportation projects within the region. These projects
   will comply with a regional plan, one which is well coordinated across
    land use, transportation and the other elements of community life and
    set on the firm foundation of the Vision 2020 and Greenways and Open
                                 Space plan.

      The transportation element of the regional plan will identify and
   prioritize the roadway, transit and other projects the community wants
     and can afford over the next twenty years. By law, our plan must be
      fiscally constrained, meaning the public can have confidence that
       listed projects are not just wishful thinking, but supported by
     expected funding. This Annual Traffic Report is one product we can
   offer the public, and of great value in helping us determine our local
                            transportation needs.

    For more detailed information please contact the City of Flagstaff's
                 Traffic Engineering Office at 928-779-7692.
