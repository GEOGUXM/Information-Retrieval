   This Section describes several of the major national and international
   awards that have been won by LLNL scientists and engineers. Although
   many different awards are presented each year, the ones listed here
   were chosen because of (1) their prestige or international stature; (2)
   their relevance to LLNL research; and (3) their importance to DOE. In
   Section 1.1, we focused on eight major awards: the Nobel Prize, the
   MacArthur Foundation Fellowship Award, the E. O. Lawrence Award, the
   Enrico Fermi Presidential Award, the Edward Teller Award, the
   Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, the James
   Clerk Maxwell Prize for Plasma Physics, and the three awards presented
   by Fusion Power Associates. For each award, we describe its purpose,
   its nominating process, and a summary of recipients affiliated with
   national laboratories, universities and other government and private
   entities. A discussion of other awards and honors, including
   recognition from DOE and awards for intellectual property and
   technology transfer, will be found in Sections 2 and 3.
