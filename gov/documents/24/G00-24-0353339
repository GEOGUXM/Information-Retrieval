   Welcome to the Regulatory & Guidance Library (RGL) home page! The RGL
   is a set of searchable databases which contain regulatory, guidance and
   aviation product information. The RGL contains Federal Aviation
   Regulations (FARs) from 14 CFR both in their current version as well as
   historical versions. It gives the user the ability to assemble certain
   FAR Parts as they existed at any date in the past (this is referred to
   as a Regulatory Basis). The RGL also contains make/model information
   for all civil aviation products including all current Type Certificate
   Data Sheets (TCDS). In addition, it contains all current Airworthiness
   Directives (ADs) and all aviation safety Advisory Circulars (ACs).
   Select the desired section of the RGL you want to view from the
   following:
