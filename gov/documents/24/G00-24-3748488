   INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILING PRO SE SMALL CLAIMS

   NOTICE: THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT INTENDED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR LEGAL
   ADVICE FROM YOUR ATTORNEY. THESE ARE GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS ONLY. LAWS
   AND FEES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. QUESTIONS OF A LEGAL NATURE SHOULD BE
   DIRECTED TO YOUR OWN ATTORNEY.

   Small Claims complaints cannot exceed $2,500.00. If the amount for
   which you are asking exceeds $2,500.00, seek the advice of an attorney.
   Hearings are held on Thursday mornings at 9:00 a.m. and will be
   scheduled by the McLean County Circuit Clerk's office.

   FILING FEES:
     * Under $500.00 = $54.00
     * Certified Mail: $5.00 per defendant (After January 1, 2002, $8.80)
     * Over $500.00 = $69.00

    1. 1. Fill in the Plaintiff's name.
    2. Fill in the Defendant's name.
    3. Fill in the amount of money you are seeking, with a brief
       explanation of why you are filing the complaint. You may ask for

       signatures witnessed.

   B. Service of the Summons.

   The Small Claims Department will issue the summons. The summons can be
   served:
     * By the Sheriff of the county in which the defendant(s) reside(s)
       or,
     * By Certified Mail in McLean County only.
     * By a Private Process Server

   If you wish to have the summons served by the Sheriff, you will need to
   contact the Sheriff's office for the fees required to serve the
   summons. The McLean County Sheriff's department requires payment before
   the summons is served. If the McLean County Sheriff is to provide
   service, our office will deliver the papers to the Sheriff's office.

   If the summons is to be served outside of McLean County or by Private
   Process, the Circuit Clerk's office will prepare the summons and notify
   the Plaintiff when it is ready for pick up. Instructions will provide
   the county and county seat in which the Defendant(s) reside(s). It is
   the Plaintiff's responsibility to see that the paper work processed is
   delivered to the appropriate county, and once the summons has been
   served, it must be returned to the McLean County Circuit Clerk's
   Office.

   If the summons is to be sent by Certified Mail (McLean County
   only), there will be a$5.00 (after January 1, 2002-- 8.80) fee for each
   defendant. The Plaintiff will need to complete the "Affidavit of
   Mailing" on the back of the summons by printing the defendant's name
   and address, then signing the Affidavit. The signature must be
   witnessed. The Certified mail will be sent to the address provided on
