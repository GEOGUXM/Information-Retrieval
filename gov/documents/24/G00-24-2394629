     cedar tree on Teal Slough property believed to be approximately 800
                                  years old

   On June 8, 2001, the Trustees announced the acquisition and transfer
   into Refuge ownership of the Teal Slough property -- 338 acres of
   forest, 60 acres of which is old growth. This acquisition is one of
   several projects under the "Marbled Murrelet Habitat Protection"
   portion of the Tenyo Marue NRDA restoration plan, intended to provide
   nesting habitat for marbled murrelets, to restore local salmon runs,
   and to provide an important habitat for Van Dyke and Dunn's
   salamanders. The Willapa National Wildlife Refuge will own, protect,
   and manage this valuable resource.

   If you have any questions about any of the restoration activities being
   implemented under the Restoration Plan, please contact Cindy Chaffee.

                                SITE SUMMARY

   coast off the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary

   THE SPILL.
   On July 22, 1991, the Chinese freighter TUO HAI collided with the
   Japanese fishing vessel TENYO MARU approximately 25 miles northwest of
   Cape Flattery, off the northern Washington coast, and a short distance
   north of the United States-Canada border (in the Canadian EEZ). The
   TENYO MARU quickly sank in about 90 fathoms of water. At the time of
   the collision, the vessel had approximately 354,800 gallons of
   intermediate fuel oil and 97,800 gallons of diesel aboard, which began
   to be released as the vessel sank. The resulting slick was carried
   south and east by currents and wind and ultimately affected much of the
   Washington and a portion of the Oregon coasts.

   The northern Washington coast, the most heavily affected area, has
   immense biological, cultural and aesthetic importance and is now
   included within the (SRD) Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary
   (officially designated in July 1994). A highly productive, nearly
   pristine coastal environment of great scenic beauty, most of the
   affected area is included within the Olympic National Park, several
   wildlife refuges and the reservations of the Makah Indian Tribe, the
   Quillieute Indian Tribe, the Hoh Indian Tribe and the Quinalt Indian
   Tribe. The affected coastal waters are an extremely important area of
   bird life; the seabird colonies of Washington's outer coast are among
   the largest in the continental United States.

   The most immediately apparent injury from the spill was its impact on
   seabirds. A total of 4,300 dead birds were collected during the spill,
   including 643 which died at rehabilitation centers. Of this number,
   approximately 73% were common murres, a bird whose population was
   already substantially depressed from historic levels. The dead birds
   also included 45 marbled murrelets, a listed threatened species. A
   limited mark-recapture study conducted shortly after the spill
   indicated that the total mortalities may have been as much as 10-20
   times the number of recovered birds. The other primary immediately
   observable effect of the spill was a 108-day closure by the Indian
   Health Service of the Indian subsistence shellfish fishery in the
   affected area.

   THE SETTLEMENT
   lighthouse, On December 23, 1994, the United States (on behalf of NOAA,
   the Interior Department, the Department of Transportation and the
   National Pollution Fund), the Washington Department of Ecology and the
   Makah Indian Tribe entered into a settlement with the Maruha
   Corporation and the Japan Ship Owners' Mutual Protection and Indemnity
   Assn. (the owners and the insurers of the TENYO MARU), Tianjin Ocean
   Shipping Co., the China Ocean Shipping Co. and the United Kingdom
   Mutual Steam Ship Assurance Assn. (Bermuda) Ltd. (the owners, the
   operators and the insurers of the TUO HAI). The agreement covered
   claims by the United States, the State of Washington and the Makah
   Tribe for oil removal costs, natural resource damages and civil
   penalties arising from the oil spill.

   Under the settlement, the companies agreed to pay a total of $9,000,000
   (over and above approximately $2.4 million in removal costs previously
   paid). Of the total paid, $500,000 went to pay a civil penalty assessed
   by the U.S. Coast Guard, $3,000,000 went to reimburse oil removal
   costs, $340,028 was paid to reimburse damage assessment costs, and the
   balance ($5,159,972, plus interest) was allocated to natural resource
   damages.

   The consent decree
   containing the settlement was filed in the United States District Court
   for the Western District of Washington under the case name United
   States of America, the State of Washington and the Makah Indian Tribe
   vs. Maruha Corporation, the Japan Ship Owners' Mutual Protection and
   Indemnity Assn., Tianjin Ocean Shipping Co., China Ocean Shipping Co.,
   and the United Kingdom Mutual Steam Ship Assurance Assn. (Bermuda)
   Ltd., Civ. No. 94-1537 (W.D. Wash., Dec. 23, 1994).

                                 RESTORATION

   The Natural Resource Trustees for the spill (NOAA, the Interior
   Department, the State of Washington and the Makah Indian Tribe) entered
   into a memorandum of agreement and formed a Trustee Committee to guide
   planning and implementing restoration actions to be taken with the
   funds recovered for natural resource damages. The Final Restoration
   Plan is available to view or download -- see below. Status reports on
   the restoration projects will be posted here when available.

   RESTORATION PROJECTS:

     * Marbled Murrelet Habitat Protection and River Silt Reduction
          + Purpose: To permanently protect marbled murrelet nesting
            habitats in Washington State and to reduce silt deposits on
            kelp ecosystems at the mouths of streams and rivers in or near
            the ecosystems affected by the oil spill.
          + Goal: To permanently protected marbled murrelet nesting
            habitat and buffer habitats above and beyond those efforts
            required by other regulations and programs.
          + Estimated Budget: $2,570,000.
          + Project 1: Acquisition of Teal Slough: $1.2 million
          + Project 2: Conservation Easement on Waatch Valley property,
            northern Washington - pending
          + Project 3: Terrestrial surveys for marbled murrelet nesting
            habitat. Data will be collected in Summer 2001 (Year One), and
            potentially, depending on data results, in Summer 2002 (Year
            Two).
     * Public Education Signs and Brochures
          + Purpose: To inform boaters, kayakers, aircraft pilots, and
            other visitors about disturbance impacts to nesting seabird
            colonies and the Makah Indian Tribe's culturally sensitive
            areas and educate them on how to avoid such disturbances.
          + Goal: To educate the public on how modifying their behavior
            can decrease adverse impacts on seabird productivity and
            survival. This project complements the efforts underway by the
            Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary, the Olympic National
            Parks, and the USFWS.
          + Estimated Budget: $100,000.
          + Estimated Date of Completion: Summer 2001.
       Restoration of Common Murre Colonies in Copalis National Wildlife
       Refuge (NWR), Washington.
          + Purpose: To restore common murre colonies, using social
            attraction techniques, to locations in the Copalis NWR that
            are not used now for breeding but which were historically
            breeding colony locations.
          + Goal: To reestablish a self-sustainable breeding population of
            common murres.
          + Estimated Budget: $1,800,000.
          + Estimated Date of Completion: In Fall 2001, the data collected
            from the spring/summer 2001 (Year One) will be evaluated to
            determine the feasibility of installing social attraction
            devices on the rocks off the coast of the Refuge. Should the
            project be unable to be implemented, then the remaining funds
            will be redistributed to the Marbled Murrelet Habitat Project
            or a tufted puffin restoration project.
       Oiled Wildlife Rehabilitation Center
          + Completion Date: The State has until April 2003 to fully
            secure the remaining funds to construct and implement a
            rehabilitation facility before these settlement funds are
            redistributed to the Marbled Murrelet Habitat Project.
          + Purpose: To provide base funding (the State of Washington is
            to secure the remaining funds from other sources) to build a
            permanent rehabilitation facility in South Puget Sound and a
            primary care facility at Neah Bay in order to improve the
            capability to rehabilitate oiled wildlife (primarily seabirds)
            in western Washington.
          + Goal: To improve the State of Washington's ability to rescue,
            rehabilitate, and release oiled wildlife.
          + Budget: $500,000.
     * Emergency Towing Vessel at Entrance to Strait of Juan de Fuca for
       Winter Season (Dec. 1999- April 2000)
          Completion date: This project was completed in August 2000, with
            the receipt of the Report to Committee and the State's Final
            Report to the Legislature.
          Purpose: To provide assistance during the winter season, a
            high-risk season for vessels transiting the Strait of Juan de
            Fuca, the area impacted by the oil spill.
          Goal: To eliminate or mitigate the risk to restoration of
            affected sea bird populations, kelp beds and other marine
            resources posed by a drifting and/or disabled vessel during
            the winter season; to assist the State in the conduct of
            drills and exercises to test coordination with existing
            governmental and voluntary vessel safety and response
            measures; and to provide such data to the North Puget Sound
            Risk Assessment Panel as it considers improvements to the
            safety of marine transportation in North Puget Sound and the
            Strait of Juan de Fuca.
          Budget: $400,000. Unused funds or funds for which WDOE
            subsequently had obtained reimbursement from responsible
            parties, the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, and/or other
            sources, were to be redistributed to the Marbled Murrelet
            Habitat Project. Update: No unused funds were available for
            redistribution.
          Reports:. Report to Committee. The Committee has received the
            State's Final Report to the Legislature, dated December 2000.
