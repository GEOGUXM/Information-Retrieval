   Senator Graham recently completed his 365th workday - a year's worth of
   days spent laboring side-by-side with the people he represents. His
   workdays are an extension of his belief in a personal style of
   governing. He began workdays in 1974, teaching a semester of civics at
   Carol City Senior High School in Miami while serving in the Florida
   Senate. He has continued doing workdays throughout his tenure as
   governor and in the United States Senate.

   His jobs have included service as a policeman, railroad engineer,
   construction worker, fisherman, garbageman, factory worker, busboy, and
   teacher. On #365, he checked in customers, handled baggage and helped
   serve passengers on USAirways. By working closely with Floridians,
   Graham learns about the hopes and challenges they face. For him, there
   is no substitute for that kind of on-the-job experience.

   Below is a list of Senator Graham's South Florida workdays. Click on
