            Competitive Acquisitions | Acquisitions over $100,000

   In an effort to update our services and move to a paperless
   environment, HRSA invites you to participate in EC Web, a way to
   perform all solicitation, quote, and award processes electronically. EC
   Web Technologies (part of Compusearch, Inc. in McLean, VA) is now
   providing Level 1 Service free of charge to any vendor. This includes
   solicitation query, bidding, and electronic receipt of award, but no
   e-mail notifications, search or profiling capabilities (additional
   chargeable services). While we will still remain committed to obtaining
   the best services for the best price to the Government and therefore
   not excluding vendors from competition, this EC Web service would help
   make the award process run more smoothly and efficiently. If you are
   interested in EC Web, you may contact Compusearch at 703-481-3699.

Using Simplified Acquisition Procedures

   What follows are competitive acquisitions of $10,000 - $100,000. HRSA
   is now beginning to use Electronic Commerce (EC/EDI) for some
   simplified acquisitions. For further information about any of these
   solicitations send an e-mail to the appropriate buyer by clicking on
   the "contact" name. Telephone requests will NOT be honored. Request a
   copy of the solicitation by fax at (301) 443-5462, or email only.

   NOTE: Acquisitions under $100,000 are considered small purchases and
   are therefore limited to small businesses. For information on
   acquisitions over $25,000 see the Commerce Business Daily.
