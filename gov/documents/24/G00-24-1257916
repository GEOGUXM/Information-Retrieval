   GENERAL INFORMATION
   This form is in a "fillable" PDF format. If you have Adobe Acrobat
   software, you may either fill it out and print it, OR just print a
   blank copy. To bring the form to your screen, click on the icon above.
   You may also download the form before use by right clicking on that
   icon and selecting either the "Save Link As" option if using Netscape,
   OR the "Save Target As" option if using Internet Explorer. If
   downloaded, you may exit your Internet browser and access the form from
   an Adobe Acrobat 4.0 (or later) product. Adobe Acrobat Reader* is free
   for download from: http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/acrwin.htm.
   There is very little validation, computation or verification of the
   information you enter on this form. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL
   VERIFICATION such as making sure: (1) ALL required INFORMATION is
   ENTERED AND ACCURATE; (2) NONE of your text OVERWRITES any court text;
   AND (3) since at times you may be able to enter more text in a field
   than will actually print, be sure that ALL your TEXT actually SHOWS UP
   in the field AFTER you tab past it and that it PRINTS on the paper
   version of the form (i.e., you may have to do some editing as this is
   NOT "What You See Is What You Get")!
   *NOTE: Adobe Acrobat Reader only allows you to fill out and print a
   form. However both Adobe Acrobat, and Adobe Acrobat Business Tools,
   allow you to fill out and print a form, AND save the changes.
   NAVIGATION
   •To begin: Press <Tab> or mouse click to the first field (i.e., the
   debtor's name).
   •To accept text and/or move to the next field : Press <Tab>, or mouse
   click.
   •To return to a previous field : Press <Shift+Tab>, or mouse click.
   •To check boxes: Use space bar, <Enter> key or mouse click to place an
   "X" in the box.
   CAUTION: You should NOT use the <Enter> key to move to the next field.
   It can randomly move you to an undefined area, delete all highlighted
   text, etc. NOTE: If you accidently delete highlighted text, try using
   the <Esc> key to bring it back.
   PRINTING
   •After filling out the form: Press <Tab> from the last field and then
   press the space bar or click on the printer icon.
   •Before filling out the form (i.e., to print a blank form for filling
   out): Click on the printer icon at the bottom of the form.
   IMPORTANT: For the best quality output, UNCHECK ALL boxes located in
   the upper right side of the Print window (e.g., "Fit to page" should
   NOT be selected). Press OK or the <Enter> key to print.
