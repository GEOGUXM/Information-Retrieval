                            Dioxin Message Board

   The Dioxin Listserv is open to anyone interested in learning more about
   the Bay Area Dioxins Project and the dioxins issue in general. The goal
                         of this mailing list is to:
    1. facilitate discussion among the general public and agency staff
       concerned about dioxins and wishing to take action
    2. notify interested parties in public meetings -- when they are
       scheduled and what happened
    3. get the word out about informational topics in which you think
       people might be interested

             To subscribe to the list, send an e-mail message to
    maiser@listserv.abag.ca.gov with the text "subscribe dioxin-general"
   (without quotes) in the body of the message. After your subscription is
      confirmed, you can send messages to the list by e-mailing them to
                    dioxin-general@listserv.abag.ca.gov.
