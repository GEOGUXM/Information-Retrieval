   Overview

   When a hazardous material is accidentally released into the atmosphere,
   the Atmospheric Release Advisory Capability (ARAC) can map the probable
   spread of contamination in time for an emergency manager to decide if
   taking protective action is necessary. Located at the University of
   California's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, ARAC is a national
   emergency response service for real-time assessment of incidents
   involving nuclear, chemical, biological, or natural hazardous material.
   ARAC's primary function is to support the Department of Energy (DOE)
   and the Department of Defense (DoD) for radiological releases. Under
   the auspices of the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan and
   the Federal Response Plan, ARAC also assists several other federal
   agencies.

   National Atmospheric Release Advisory Center (NARAC)
   Livermore, CA Since 1979, ARAC has responded to more than 70 alerts,
   accidents, and disasters, and supported more than 800 exercises.
   Besides accidental radiological releases, ARAC has assessed natural
   disasters such as volcanic ash cloud and earthquake-induced hazardous
   spills, manmade disasters such as the Kuwaiti oil fires, and several
   toxic chemical accidents.
