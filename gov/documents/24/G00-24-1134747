 This page is written for the layperson, and is intended to introduce folks
  without a technical or scientific background to the concept of microwave
   temperature profiling, and why it is an important and useful technique.

      There will be two discussions: one short and one long. The short
     discussion will provide a top-level description of what an MTP does
     without getting into all the details and technical terms. The long
     discussion will go into more details and provide illustrations, but
      still at the layperson level. It may be useful to read the Short
                      Version before the Long Version.

   Temperature is a fundamental property of everything, big or small, and
   it can tell you important information about these systems. To determine
   whether or not you have a fever, you might place a thermometer  under
   your tongue. The thermometer directly measures your body temperature.
   To measure the vertical temperature structure of the atmosphere,
   scientists often rely on radiosondes which are launched from the ground
   and carried aloft by a helium balloon. This is also a direct
   temperature measurement. Radiosondes however are only launched twice a
   day, and launch sites are typically 500 km apart. Because the
   atmosphere's temperature can change significantly in 12 hours and over
   spatial scales much smaller than 500 km, atmospheric researchers often
   require a better means of measuring temperature. This is particularly
   important when research instruments are carried aboard aircraft to
   study problems such as the ozone holes, global warming, or the impact
   of aircraft emissions on atmospheric chemisty. Research aircraft are
   flying chemisty labs which measure dozens of gaseous species (e.g.,
   ozone, nitrous oxide, chlorine monoxide, methane, etc.) and aerosols
   (liquid or frozen particles) in the atmosphere.

   To interpret what these measurements mean, it is often necessary to
   know the temperature not just at the aircraft altitude -- where the
   chemical measurements are made -- but above and below the aircraft as
   well. The reason for this is that the vertical temperature profile
   provides meteorological context for the in situ measurements. For
   example, it is important to know whether the aircraft is in the
   troposphere (the lowest part of the atmosphere) or in the stratosphere
   (the next highest region). Ozone (O[3]) normally has much higher
   abundances in the stratosphere than the troposphere because it is
   produced there. Similarly, carbon monoxide (CO) has much higher
   abundances in the troposphere than in the stratosphere, because that's
   where it's produced. If high O[3] and low CO are seen, one might
   conclude that the aircraft is in the stratosphere. However, this
   condition can occur occasionly in the troposphere, and the only way to
   know for sure what the real situation is is to measure where the
   thermal tropopause is located, as this separates the troposphere from
   the stratosphere. To do this this we need to measure an altitude
   temperature profile.

   So how is the temperature profile of the atmosphere measured from an
   aircraft? There is really only one practicable, proven  way to do this,
   and that is to use a microwave temperature profiler (MTP). Obviously
   the MTP must make a remote temperature measurement. It does this by
   detecting the naturally-occuring thermal emission of microwaves from
   oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. As is explained in the detailed
   version of this write-up, oxygen molecules satisfy several criteria
   which make such a measurement possible. When the MTP is scanned in
   frequency and elevation about the flight altitude, it measures the
   total emission from oxygen molecules along the viewing direction. The
   temperature profile is not measured directly however. The 20 or 30
   measurements that the MTP makes in scanning from near-zenith to
   near-nadir, are converted into a temperature profile by performing a
   "retrieval" which takes into account where the aircraft is flying and
   the time of year. You might imagine that many different combinations of
   atmospheric conditions in the viewing direction might produce the same
   measurement, and you would be correct! The retrieval process, however,
   uses all of the measurements during a scan from zenith to nadir to
   figure out which is the most likely set of temperatures to produce the
   measurements, and this becomes the retrieved altitude temperature
   profile. In a nutshell, that is what an MTP does.

   MTPs have a many more potential applications beyond their use as a
   research instrument. They are useful for example in predicting the
   possibility of clear air turbulence (CAT) and icing hazard potential
   for commercial aircraft, and also improving their fuel efficiency. MTPs
   will also be able to detect when unstart conditions will occur is a
   supersonic transport (SST) fleet so that preventative measures can be
   taken. A key to making these and other applications affordable is the
   development of monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC)
   technology, which will reduce the cost of manufacture by about an order
   of magnitude.

   Introduction Most people would agree that the measurement of
   temperature is a useful thing to do. We like to know what the
   temperature is if we are planning some outdoor activity, or what our
   body temperature is if we are not feeling well.  Scientists and
   engineers have many, many more reasons to measure temperature, as it is
   a fundamental physical property of just about everything. Since my
   particular research interest is the measurement of the vertical profile
   of temperature through the atmosphere, and since that is what the
   Microwave Temperature Profiler (MTP) Web Pages are about, the ensuing
   discussion will be geared with that in mind.

How Temperature Measurements Are Made

   Generally temperature measurements are made with some kind of
   thermometer, and thermometers can be made in many different ways. The
   simplest thermometer just makes a relative temperature measurement. For
   example, if you want to check quickly whether someone has a fever, you
   might put your hand on their forehead. If their forehead is warmer than
   your hand, heat will flow to your hand, and you will conclude that they
   have a fever because they "feel" warmer than you.. Such a thermometer
   is not very useful however. What is needed is a device that can make
   absolute temperature measurements.  Thermometers are devices which are
   able to measure the average thermal energy (in an absolute sense) of
   some material or medium, and assign a temperature to it. And because
   the laws of physics are more simply expressed on a temperature scale
   with respect absolute zero, scientists generally measure temperature in
   Kelvins, rather than degrees Celcius or Fahrenheit.

   Most people are familiar with  in situ temperature measurements, where
   the thermometer is placed in or next to the thing whose temperature is
   to be determined. Often, however, this may not be possible: the medium
   may be so hot that the thermometer would either melt or loose
   calibration, or it may be so far away that it can't easily be reached.
   In these cases, remote sensing techniques must be used.  Unlike in situ
   sensors, which rely on directly heating the thermometer (e.g., a
   mercury bulb or a thermistor), remote sensing techniques rely on
   detecting the energy radiated by the object or medium of interest, and
   then determining a temperature based upon the properties of the
   radiation. We are all familiar, for example, with the "heat" energy
   that we feel near a smoldering log. This energy, which is invisible to
   the human eye, is called infrared (IR) radiation and our skin has
   evolved to be able to sense it (for obvious reasons), just like our
   eyes have evolved to sense visible light (also for obvious reasons).

   [ir20.gif] So what is it about radiation that let's us measure
   temperature? Radiation, or more properly electromagnetic radiation, is
   part of a broad energy spectrum of naturally occuring thermal (and
   non-thermal) emissions which are carried by particles called photons.
   Photons travel at the speed of light in a vacuum, and their energy is
   characterized by either their wavelength or their frequency. The most
   energetic photons have the shortest wavelengths (highest frequencies),
   and include gamma rays and x-rays. In the "middle" of the
   electromagnetic spectrum, at lower energy, are the ultraviolet (UV),
   visible and infrared (IR) photons. Microwaves and long radio waves, the
   least energetic of the photons, are at the longest wavelengths (lowest
   frequencies). Now, without getting into the thermal physics of all
   this, when an object is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its
   surroundings (that is, when it emits and absorbs equal amounts of
   energy), the intensity of its thermal emission at any frequency (or
   wavelength) depends on only one thing -- it's temperaure! This
   remarkable fact, which physicists refer to as the Planck Blackbody
   Distribution, is the basis for most remote temperature measurements.
   Generally, remote temperature sensing is done in the infrared at
   wavelengths between 0.7 and 20 microns. (see Infrared Temperature
   Measurement Theory and Application for an introductory discussion of IR
   remote sensing).

Microwave Remote Temperature Sensing

   In principle, however, temperature can be measured at any wavelength of
   the electromagnetic spectrum; the proper choice depends on the details
   of the application. In the case of atmospheric remote temperature
   sensing, advantage is taken of several properties of oxygen molecules,
   which comprise 23% of the mass of the Earth's atmosphere.

   First, oxygen molecules radiate (and absorb) at a number of discrete
   frequencies between 50 and 70 GHz (microwaves with a wavelength of ~0.5
   cm). These discrete frequencies, or spectral lines, are a consequence
   of rules of quantum mechanics which only allow oxygen molecules to have
   particular rotational energy states. Furthermore, since the oxygen
   molecules are in thermodynamic equilibrium with the local environment,
   this means that if we can measure the strength of the thermal emission
   from the oxygen molecules, then we can deduce the physical temperature
   of the molecules that produced this emission. Microwaves also have an
   advantage over infrared temperature sensing techniques in that they are
   only minimally affected by the presence of clouds. In addition, the
   receiver and detector technology is very mature.

   [O2abs.gif] Second, the oxygen absorption is strong enough that the
   effective distance that emission is "seen" from is of the order of a
   few kilometers, depending on the frequency and altitude, as is shown in
   the figure, which illustrates the absorption in units of Nepers/km for
   altitudes of 0, 10, and 20 km. On the ground the oxygen absorption is a
   single broad feature because individual oxygen emission lines have been
   blended together by what is known as pressure broadening. At 10 km
   (~33,000 feet, the approximate altitude jet liners fly)  individual
   absorption features (spectral lines) are beginning to be seen as
   pressure broadening of the emission lines becomes less important, and
   at 20 km (the approximate altitude the highest research aircraft fly)
   many individual spectral lines can be seen.

   [wf.GIF] Because any oxygen emission is absorbed in proportion to its
   distance from the instrument detecting it (a MTP in our case), nearby
   emission is absorbed little and the absorption increases exponentially
   with distance (r) in the viewing direction, which in the figure is
   inclined to the direction of flight. The integrated emission can be
   represented by a "weighting function" (W(r)) which characterizes the
   weighted mean distance of the emission. In the special case where the
   temperature lapses at a constant rate with distance, it is easy to show
   that the brightness temperature measured by the radiometer is exactly
   equal to the physical temperature at the e-folding (R[a])distance for
   the absorption. More complicated situations require more detailed
   treatment.

   Third, oxygen molecules are a well-mixed component of the atmosphere at
   all heights, which is to say that the number of emitting molecules at
   any height depends only on the pressure altitude. Water vapor, for
   example, could not be used as a temperature surrogate because it's
   distribution (or mixing ratio) compared to its surroundings varies
   erratically. This characteristic is important because the strength of
   the signal emitted by the oxygen molecules (which we want to use to
   determine the temperature) depends not only on their temperature, but
   also on the number of emitting molecules (as measured by the pressure),
   and to a much lesser degree humidity. We must understand these
   dependencies to interpret our measurements. It is clear from the figure
   above that absorption decreases with altitude; the effect of
   temperature on absorption is opposite to pressure: lower temperatures
   increase absorption. These two effects somewhat offset each other, but
   pressure wins out and there is a net decrease of absorption with
   altitude.

A Standard Atmosphere

   [StdAtmos.gif] The figure to the right shows how pressure and
   temperature vary with altitude for a standard atmospheric model, which
   for the case shown represents average conditions at mid-latitudes.
   Since pressure at any height is just the total weight per unit area of
   all the air above, it decreases exponentially with height (blue curve)
   and varies little from the exponential shape shown. The behaviour of
   temperature (red curve) is more complicated. It typically decreases
   with altitude until the tropopause is reached. The rate of temperature
   change with altitude (the lapse rate) varies from about -10 K/km for
   dry air to about -5 K/km for moist air. These large lapse rates are the
   result of convective mixing in the region below the tropopause called
   the troposphere. This is where most weather occurs. By contrast the
   region above the tropopause -- the stratosphere -- is relatively benign
   as it is convectively stable. The temperature in the stratosphere
   varies from being nearly constant (isothermal) at high latitudes (the
   polar regions) to increasing slowly with altitude at low latitudes (the
   tropics). The heat source in the stratosphere is the absorption of
   ultraviolet radiation from the sun by ozone molecules.

The Airborne Operation of a MTP

   [wamsu50.jpg] An MTP generally consists of two assemblies: a sensor
   unit (SU), which receives and detects the signal, and a data unit (DU),
   which controls the SU and records the data. In addition, on some
   platforms there may be a third element, a real-time analysis computer
   (RAC), which analyzes the data to produce temperature profiles and
   other data products in real time. The SU is shown in the image to the
   right and the DU and RAC are shown in the image below. The SU is
   connected to the DU with power, control, and data cables. In addition
   the DU has interfaces to the aircraft navigation data bus and the RAC,
   if one is present. Navigation data is needed so that information such
   as altitude, pitch and roll are available for the MTP data analysis.
   Aircraft altitude is needed to perform retrievals (which are altitude
   dependent), while pitch and roll are needed for controlling the
   position of a stepper motor which must drive a scanning mirror to
   predetermined elevation angles.

   [s50_adapter_ring.jpg] In the SU image the scanning mirror is almost
   edge on and pointing slightly upward and out of the page. The horn --
   the equivalent of an antenna -- which receives the signal is
   perpendicular to the left side of the box and faces the scanning mirror
   which is inclined at 45 degrees to the horn. This mirror rotates about
   an axis through the horn  which is nearly normal to the flight
   direction (perpendicular to the side of the box with JPL written on it)
   and allows viewing from near nadir (straight down) to near zenith
   (straight up). At each viewing position a radio frequency signal
   source, called a local oscillator (LO), is sequenced through two or
   more frequencies and combined with the oxygen signal reflected off of
   the mirror to produce a signal which is detected. A calibration target
   is the white object behind the scanning mirror. The SU box dimensions
   are 14 cm W x 16 cm H x 24 cm D and it weighs ~5 kg. The DU and RAC are
   shown below in a WB57F superpod. Their dimensions are 36 cm W x 10 cm H
   x 20 cm D and 25 cm W x 8 cm H x 35 cm D, respectively, and each unit
   weights ~5 kg.

   Because each frequency has a different effective viewing distance, the
   MTP is able to "see" to different distances by changing frequency. In
   addition, because the viewing direction is also varied and because the
   atmospheric opacity is temperature and pressure dependent, different
   effective viewing distances are also achieved through scanning in
   elevation. For a two-frequency radiometer with 10 elevation angles,
   each 15-second observing cycle produces a set of 20 signals (called
   brightness temperatures), which are converted through a data analysis
   procedure called a linear retrieval algorithm to a profile of air
   temperature versus altitude, T(z).

   [sss_951211a.gif] Finally, radiometric calibration is performed using
   the outside air temperature (OAT) and a heated reference target to
   determine the instrument gain. However, complete calibration of the
   system to include "window corrections" and other effects, requires
   tedious analysis and comparison with radiosondes near the aircraft
   flight path. This is probably the most important single factor
   contributing to reliable calibration. For stable MTPs, such
   calibrations appear to be reliable for many years. Such analysis is
   always performed before MTP data are placed on mission archive
   computers. An example of an altitude temperature profile (ATP) is shown
   to right in yellow. The location of the tropopause is shown be the
   horizontal white dashed line; the aircraft altitude is indicated by the
   short yellow horizontal line at 35,000 feet (right scale), just below
   the tropopause. More information on this and other MTP data products
   can be found here.

Glossary

   Lapse Rate The rate at which temperature changes with increasing
   altitude.

   Mixing Ratio By volume, the number of molecules of a particular
   specicies (e.g. water vapor) divided by the number of other molecules
   in a given volume. By mass, the mass of a particular species (e.g.
   water vapor) divided by the total mass of other molecules in a given
   volume.

   Nepers/km A unit of absorption defined such that the reciprocal of this
   quantity is the e-folding distance for the signal attenuation; that is,
   the distance at which the signal is reduced by a factor of exp(-1), or
   0.367 of the original signal strength. An absorption of 3 Nepers/km
   would reduce a signal of strength 1 unit to 0.05 units (or 5%) in one
   km.

   Tropopause   Because of convective mixing in the lower atmosphere
   (i.e., the troposphere) temperature decreases with increasing altitude
   because as rising air parcels enter regions of lower pressure, they
   expand and cool. This continues until a temperature inversion (that is,
   a warmer temperature) is encountered. At this point, rising air parcels
   are heavier than the surrounding air and sink back down. Normally this
   inversion occurs at the tropopause. Above the tropopause (in the
   stratosphere)  the air becomes warmer because it is being heated by the
   absorption of ultraviolet sunlight by ozone.
