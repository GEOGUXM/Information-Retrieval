                        TRMM Fire Product Image Page


   The TRMM/TSDIS Fire Products include two parts:

    1. The Daily hot spot image shows the geographic positions of global
       fire pixels daily. Typically, a pixel is identified as a fire pixel
       if the VIRS channel 3 brightness temperature is above 320 K and
       temperature difference between channel 3 and channel 4 is above 20
       K in daytime. In nighttime, the channel 3 brightness temperature is
       required to be above 315 K and the temperature difference between
       channel 3 and channel 4 to be above 15 K. The bare ground pixels
       and sun glint pixels are excluded in the Daily hot spot image.
    2. The Monthly product is a 0.5 latitude by 0.5 longitude composite
       map of fire counts for each month beginning January 1998. The Data
       Source File of the monthly product lists necessary information of
       all the hot spot pixels of the month. The information includes:
       date, granule number, solar zenith angle, latitude, longitude, land
       type, reflectance of channels 1&2, brightness temperatures of
       channels 3 &4, difference of channel 3 brightness temperatures and
       channel 4 brightness temperature and environmental channel 3 &4
       brightness temperatures. The sunglint pixels are not excluded in
       the Data Source File.
       NOTE: the data source files are normal text files that have been
       compressed with gzip.
