                            New PreView: IRS.gov.

   This redesigned Digital Daily home page is scheduled to be launched in
     January. This page is a PreView of what the Digital Daily home page
    will look like. Note the "intention-based" menu at the left, allowing
   you to get right to the information you are looking for without having
                              to search for it.


   Why are we redesigning it?
   We have redesigned the Digital Daily because we know that you want an
   easy to navigate website with information literally at your finger
   tips. Both the look and feel of the Digital Daily as well as the
   intention-based capability to access the most current tax information
   are part of this redesign effort. What that means to you is that the
   redesigned website will be more intuitive and user friendly. You will
   be able to target and access the information you want in fewer clicks!
   And the IRS will be able to update and manage the information on the
   Digital Daily more efficiently and accurately.
   What do I need to know?
   You need to know that bookmarks that have been placed on the current
   Digital Daily may not carry through to the redesigned site. You may be
   redirected to the corresponding new page for some period of time.
   Because the Digital Daily has been designed for you to more easily get
   what you need quickly, you will want to explore what it has to offer
   and re-bookmark the pages you intend to use frequently.
   What is next?
   Because the redesign of the Digital Daily is part of the IRS
   Modernization effort, we will continue to enhance and improve the site
   to keep it responsive to your tax information needs.
     * Please send us your comments on this PreView.
     * You can still access the current Digital Daily.
