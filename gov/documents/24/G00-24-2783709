   Who We Are
   How the DAACs Get Data

   art element T he science community sets priorities for data collected,
   archived and distributed by the DAACs, and for the services we provide.

   A User Working Group, with international memberships of independent
   research scientists, oversees each DAAC's management, meeting regularly
   to make sure data products address user needs. The DAACs maintain close
   ties with our science user communities, and with remote sensing
   instrument teams, in order to provide relevant, useful products. The
   DAACs collaborate with each other to provide standard services and
   documentation, access to common searching tools, and to preserve data
   for future generations of scientists.
