     Press Release: Senator Stabenow Announces Legislation to Honor the
              Victims of the September 11th Attacks (10/16/01)


                       Unity in the Spirit of America

   We all witnessed a great national tragedy on September the 11th. While
   the deaths and damage occurred in New York, Washington and the fields
   of Pennsylvania, a piece of all of us died that day.

                                [f1small.jpg]

   Many people came up to me in the weeks after the attack and asked:
   "What can I do? I've given blood. I've donated to the relief efforts.
   But I want to do more."

   We all shared in the horror. Now everyone wants to share in the
   healing.

   But how?

   Then a constituent of mine - Bob Van Oosterhout - wrote me with an
   idea. Why not have the federal government devise a program that would
   encourage communities throughout the nation to create something that
   would honor the memory of one of the victims lost in the attack?
   Together these local memorials to honor individuals would dot our
   nation and collectively honor all those lost in the attack.

   What could be simpler? Or more moving?
   From that idea came the Unity in the Spirit of America Act, which I am
   sponsoring.

   Here's how it would work:
   Communities - it could be as small as a neighborhood block - or
   non-profit organizations, houses of worship, businesses or local
   governments would choose some kind of project that would unite them and
   their community.

                                [f2small.jpg]

   Ultimately, each community service project would be dedicated to a
   specific victim of the attack of Sept. 11. Applications and the
   assigning of names for each project will be handled by the Points of
   Light Foundation, in cooperation with the Corporation for National
   Community Service.

                                [f3small.jpg]

   I hope we will pass this bill quickly. But in the meantime, I urge
   people to meet with their neighbors, or coworkers or fellow church
   members to start identifying projects that would make fitting memorials
   to victims of the attack.
   It could be cleaning or creating a park, adopting a school and
   mentoring students, creating a feeding program for the homeless . . .
   or just about anything that would do honor to the memories of those who
   died on September the 11th.
   The Points of Light Foundation will track each project's progress with
   a national database and publish the information on their web pages.
   The only rule would be that qualified projects should be completed by
   September 11, 2002.

                                [f4small.jpg]

   Then on that day - as all over America we gather to grieve over the
   first anniversary of the attack that enraged the world - we'll also be
   able to look over thousands and thousands of selfless acts that made
   our world better.
   In our sadness, we can create 6,000 points of life across our nation.
   And we will show the world that that our resolve was not fleeting, or
   our memories not short.
   They will see Unity in the Spirit of America.
   And what could bring more fitting honor to all those innocents we lost?
