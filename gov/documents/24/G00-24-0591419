     HRSA to Make Available Almost $25M for AIDS Education and Training
                               Centers Program

   HHS Health Resources and Services Administration today announced the
   availability of an estimated $24.8 million for a new cycle of
   competitive grants to support the training and education of health care
   professionals treating people living with HIV/AIDS.

   HRSA will award the grants under its AIDS Education and Training
   Centers (AETCs) program, which provides state-of-the-art treatment
   education, training, and consultation to health care professionals
   treating HIV-infected patients through a network of regional and
   national training centers.

   Funding is available for:

   ยง         Regional AETCs to provide education, training, consultation,
   and assistance to health care professionals in defined geographic
   areas;

   ยง         One AETC National Resource Center to coordinate the
   development of training materials, disseminate new treatment
   information, support the regional AETCs, and represent AETCs
   nationally; and

   ยง         One National Minority AETC to build capacity for HIV/AIDS
   care among minority health care professionals, with special emphasis on
   building capacity in Historically Black Colleges and Universities,
   Hispanic Serving Institutions, and Tribal Colleges.

   In addition, HRSA will consider providing funds to create AETC Centers
   for Excellence to focus on specific issues in HIV care.

   The grants will be awarded to public and nonprofit private entities,
   schools, and academic health sciences centers.  Special consideration
   will be given to applicants that can provide services to front-line HIV
   clinical care providers who serve minority and disproportionately
   affected populations.
   Application guidance materials are now available and may be obtained
   online at http://hab.hrsa.gov/grant.htm or by calling the HRSA Grants
   Application Center at 1-877-477-2123.  Applications are due March 15,
   2002.
