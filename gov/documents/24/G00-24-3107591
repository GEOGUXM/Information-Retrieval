   Airports & Logistics (AMA-600)

   The Airports and Logistics Division (AMA-600) provides training to all
   FAA airports' and logistics' personnel. Courses cover all phases of
   airport development and management, and all aspects of materiel
   management. AMA-600 also provides training to those outside the FAA,
   such as international students, and state personnel who work in the
   airport community.

   In 2001, the Airports and Logistics Division developed new resident and
   distance learning courses in both the Airports and the Logistics
   Branches. AMA-600 will continue to seek innovative ways to provide the
   highest quality and most cost effective training available. This
   division is dedicated to supporting the Academy's overall goal of being
   the premiere training organization worldwide.

   "We are small but mighty. We have highly trained, and highly motivated
   people. This gives us a double edged sword to meet any challenge!"
   -Alford L. Mitchell
