   Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center - Partners

   Major partners of our center include the National Park Service (Glacier
   National Park, Yellowstone National Park, and Grand Teton National
   Park), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land
   Management, the U.S. Forest Service, Montana State University, the
   University of Montana, Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks,
   Wyoming Game and Fish Department, and Idaho Department of Game and
   Fish.

   In addition to working with these institutions, our Center is closely
   involved with numerous partners in collaborative efforts through the
   Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee, the Greater Yellowstone
   Coordinating Committee, the Northern Yellowstone Cooperative Wildlife
   Working Group, the Pacific Flyway  Council, and other joint ventures.
   Our role in all of these activities is to provide objective scientific
   information that can be used by others in making natural resource
   management decisions.  As our Center continues to develop, it will
   increase the ability of USGS to provide such scientific support
