   Name Record Play (NRP) has been discontinued as a conference feature.
   The alternate conference type and feature suggested is Standard Service
   Level with the Enter / Announce feature. When reserving this type of
   conference, the Operator will answer the call from the participants,
   request their name and announce them into the conference. If necessary,
   NASA can request that the Operator perform a Roll Call before turning
   over the conference to the call leader. Please refer to the VoTS User
   Guide for more information.
