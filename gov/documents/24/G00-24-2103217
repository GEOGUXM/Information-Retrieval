       When composing a query there are several rules to keep in mind
                                    [Top]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Words separated by spaces or ordinary punctuation (which are not listed
   as special characters in the tables later in this section) are treated
   as a phrase. The search will only return documents that contain this
   phrase. However, words within the phrase which are listed in the noise
   list (such as a, as, and, but, for, etc.) are ignored completely.
   Matching is also case-insensitive. So searching for
the State; and the County
will also match

   the state of a county.

   To search for a phrase that contains quotation marks, or one of the
   special characters such as an exclamation mark, we have to enclose the
   whole phrase in quotation marks, and then place double quotation marks
   where we want a quotation mark to appear. For example,

   "he yelled ""Hello!"" from across the street".

   To search for several individual words in a document, we separate the
   words with a comma. The result will be documents that contain all, or
   only some, of the words listed. The more that match, however, the
   better the ranking of the result.

   Other than that, we can use the normal wildcard and Boolean operators.
   An asterisk matches any number of characters, and a question mark
   matches any single character. There's also the option of a fuzzy
   search. Adding two asterisks to the end of a word will match 'stem
   words' with the same meaning. A search for
catch**, for instance, will include catching and caught.

   To combine words in the search string, we use Boolean operators like
   this:

   Boolean Keywords Shorthand Meaning
   Apples AND Pears
Apples & Pears

   Both must exist in the document.
   Apples OR Pears
Apples | Pears

   Either must exist in the document.
   Apples AND NOT Pears
Apples & !Pears

   The first word must exist in the document, but the second must not.
   Apples NEAR Pears
Apples ~ Pears

   Both must exist in the document, and be within 50 words of each other.
   The closer they are, the higher the ranking in the search result.
   NOT @size < 2049
!@size < 2049

   Document must be larger than 2 KB.
