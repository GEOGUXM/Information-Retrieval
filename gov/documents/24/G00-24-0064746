   What's New

        Public Comment Period On Presidio Water Recycling Proposal To Begin
                                      Shortly


   We are pleased to announce that plans for a proposed water recycling
   plant on the Presidio are moving forward. The Water Recycling Project
   Environmental Assessment (EA) will be released shortly for public
   review and comment.

   The Trust is proposing a project to provide high quality recycled water
   for landscape irrigation at the Presidio, while minimizing wastewater
   flows entering San Francisco's combined sewer system. Use of recycled
   water has long been envisioned at the park, and was originally
   identified by the National Park Service as part of the General
   Management Plan Amendment (GMPA) of 1994. The proposed recycled water
   project, in combination with water conservation and best management
   practices, are cornerstones in the Trust's approach to sustainable
   water management.

   A copy of the EA, when available, will be posted on this website,
   placed in the Trust Library, or will be mailed upon request. Please
   call the Presidio Trust Planning Department at (415) 561-5414 or email
   planning@presidiotrust.gov if you would like to be included on the EA
   mailing list.
