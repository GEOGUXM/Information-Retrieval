   Burning Plasma Physics is Widely Accepted as the Primary Objective for
   a Next Step in Fusion Science * Grunder Panel (98) and Madison Forum
   endorsed Burning Plasmas as next step. * NRC Interim Report (99)
   identified "integrated physics of a self-heated plasma" as one of the
   critical unresolved fusion science issues. * The Snowmass Fusion Summer
   Study (99) endorsed the burning plasma physics objective, and that the
   tokamak was technically ready for high-gain experiment. A burning
   plasma experiment should also have advanced tokamak capability. * SEAB
   (99) noted that "There is general agreement that the next large machine
   should, at least, be one that allows the scientific exploration of
   burning plasmas" and if Japan and Europe do not proceed with ITER "the
   U. S. should pursue a less ambitious machine that will allow the
   exploration of the relevant science at lower cost." ..... "In any event
   the preliminary planning for such as machine should proceed now so as
   to allow the prompt pursuit of this option." * NRC/FuSAC (00) - "The US
   scientific community needs to take the lead in articulating the goals
   of an achievable, cost-effective scientific burning plasma experiment,
   and to develop flexible strategies to achieve it, including
   international collaboration." NSO/FIRE Community Discussions A
   Proactive NSO/FIRE Outreach Program has been undertaken to solicit
   comments and suggestions from the community on the next step in
   magnetic fusion. * Presentations have been made and comments received

   The FIRE web site has been developed to make information on FIRE and
   fusion science accessible and up to date. Over 15,000 visitors from
   around the world have logged on to the FIRE web site since the site was
   initiated in July, 1999. UFA Workshop on Burning Plasma Science First
   Workshop - 90 participants- December 11-13, 2000 University of Texas *
   Extension of Madison Forum, Snowmass discussions on burning plasmas. *
   Focused on Sciences Issues for/by burning plasmas * Five Science Issue
   Breakout groups were established: 1. Energetic Alpha Particles Issues
   for a Burning Plasma 2. Confinement, Transport and Self-heating in
   Burning Plasma 3. Macrostability in a Burning Plasma 4. Boundary Plasma
   Science 5. Relationship of Burning Plasma Science to Other Fields *
   Strong nonlinear coupling that will occur in a strongly burning plasma
   was an overall theme. Action Item - need to develop a more compelling
   case. * Some sentiment that a BP might be boring, that is,
   extrapolation too small from existing parameters. Others, expressed
   concern that strongly burning plasmas in an AT configuration with high
   bootstrap would be uncontrollable. Several areas identified where
   tokamak BP would shed light on understanding science issues for other
   configurations. Next Step Option PAC is Engaged and Active. * Members:

   17-18, 2001 at MIT, Cambridge, MA July 11-12, 2001 at Univ. Wisc,
   Madison, WI * Charge for First and Second meetings Scientific value of
   a Burning Plasma experiment Scientific readiness to proceed with such
   an experiment Is the FIRE mission scientifically appropriate? Is the
   initial FIRE design point optimal? * Extensive PAC Reports provide
   detailed recommendations for the FIRE activity to address. NSO-PAC
   reports are on FIRE (http://fire.pppl.gov), will discuss in more detail
   under FY 2001-03 Plans. Common Themes Emerging from NSO-PAC, UFA

   optimum config.? Baseline Wedged (BeCu) design meets requirem`ts, will
   start peer review critical systems. Beginning design of a Bucked and
   Wedged (Cu) Configuration. Internal hardware and PFCs are a common
   challenge for tokamaks and other MF configs. Community Involvement Must
   develop a more exciting and compelling case for a next step magnetic
   fusion exp`t. Presently an outreach emphasis, must transition to
   greater community involvement. UFA workshops, Science Initiatives for
   NSO, etc are opportunities for progress. Steps from the Vision to FIRE

   The coupling of advanced tokamak modes with strongly burning plasmas is
   a generic issue for all advanced "toroidal" systems. The VLT PAC,
   Snowmass Burning Plasma and Energy Subgroup B recommended that a
   burning plasma experiment should have AT capability. * FIRE, with
   strong plasma shaping, flexible double null poloidal divertor, low TF
   ripple, dual inside launch pellet injectors, and space reserved for the
   addition of current drive (LHCD) and/or a smart conducting wall, has
   the capabilities needed to investigate advanced tokamak regimes in a
   high gain burning plasma. * The LN inertially cooled TF coil has a
   pulse length capability ~250 s at 4T for DD plasmas. This long pulse -
   AT capability rivals that of any existing divertor tokamak or any under
   construction. The coils are not the limit. * Recent AT regimes on
   DIII-D (Shot 98977) sustained for ~ 16 !E serve as demonstration
   discharges for initial AT experiments on FIRE. Need to develop
   self-consistent scenarios with profile control on FIRE with durations ~
   3 !skin . TF Flattop Duration vs. Field Strength in the FIRE could

   Conclusions of the FIRE Design Study * Exploration, understanding and
   optimization of fusion-dominated (high-gain) burning plasmas are
   critical issues for all approaches to fusion. * The tokamak is a
   cost-effective vehicle to investigate fusion-dominated plasma physics
   and its coupling to advanced toroidal physics for MFE. The tokamak is
   technically ready for a next step to explore fusion plasma physics. *
   The FIRE compact high field tokamak can address the important fusion-
   dominated plasma issues, many of the long pulse advanced tokamak issues
   and begin the coupling of fusion-dominated plasmas with advanced
   toroidal physics in a $1B class facility. * The FIRE design point has
   been chosen to be a "stepping stone" between the physics accessible
   with present experiments and the physics required for the ARIES vision
   of magnetic fusion energy. * A plan is being developed for an Advanced
   Tokamak Next Step that will address physics, engineering and cost
   issues in FY 2000-2 with the goal of being ready to begin a Conceptual
   Design in 2003. Laboratories are Needed to Explore, Explain and Expand
