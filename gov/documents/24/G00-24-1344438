Provide Electronic Signatures

   Students and Parents can use this site to electronically sign FAFSA on
   the Web applications, including FAFSA on the Web, the Renewal FAFSA on
   the Web, and FAFSA Corrections on the Web.

   You must first submit a FAFSA in order to provide an electronic
   signature. If you have not filled out a FAFSA and would like to fill
   out a FAFSA on the Web, please select Filling Out a FAFSA.

   To electronically sign your FAFSA, students and parents (if applicable)
   must have a PIN. If you do not have or forgot your PIN, go to the PIN
   Site.

   In order to provide an electronic signature, we will ask you for some
   basic identifying information and your PIN, as well as whether you're
   signing as a student or a parent. If you're signing as a parent you
   will also need to supply information about the student. We will then
   ask you what type of application you want to electronically sign.

   Please note: if you do not receive a confirmation page and number, then
   the Department of Education has not received your electronic signature.



     What is the school year of the application you would like to sign?

   The 2002-2003 School Year (July 1st, 2002 - June 30th, 2003)
   The 2001-2002 School Year (July 1st, 2001 - June 30th, 2002)
