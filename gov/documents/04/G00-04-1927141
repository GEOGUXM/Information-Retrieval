   Dear Friends:

   Small amounts mail from the United States Postal Service (USPS) are
   being delivered to Senate offices. United Parcel Service, FedEx,
   courier and other delivery services are being delivered on a limited
   basis.

   All mail received by the United States Senate is being screened and
   irradiated before delivery.  Because of the irridation process,
   postcards will arrive in far better condition -- and more quickly --
   than regular mail. If possible, we will be grateful for your sending
   postcards instead of regular mail while this security process is
   necessary.

   It may take a week or more for our office to receive your letter so
   please contact one of my state offices or my Washington office by phone
   (202-224-6342) if you need immediate assistance.  You may also contact
   the office by facsmile (202-228-1339), e-mail
   (jesse_helms@helms.senate.gov)or using the webform if you are from
   North Carolina.

   I deeply appreciate your understanding.
