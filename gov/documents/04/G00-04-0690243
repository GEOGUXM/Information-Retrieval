   Welcome to the Infrared Data Subnode, located at NASA's Goddard Space
   Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Maryland. The Infrared Data Subnode
   is a subsidiary of the Planetary Atmospheres Node of NASA's Planetary
   Data System. We validate, archive and distribute digital data from
   infrared observations of planetary atmospheres, both from spacecraft
   and from ground-based observations.
