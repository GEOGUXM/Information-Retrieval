   [kerrypic.jpg] Welcome to the homepage of the United States Senates
   Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship. I invite you to have a
   look around and discover what the Senate and the Members of the
   Committee are doing to promote and protect small businesses in the
   United States. Small businesses are the backbone of our growing
   economy, and I am confident that this website will contribute to the
   recognition that small businesses deserve. On this site you will find
   information on both hearings and legislation, in addition to press
   releases from my office. I hope you find this site to be a very
   informational and useful tool.
