            Attention:  This site uses server push technology and the
        multipart/x-mixed-replace MIME type to deliver streaming images.
        These pages should be viewed with a NetScape compatible browser.

        If you have problems viewing the Live Video on these pages please
        update your WWW software to a version which supports Server Push
                                   Technology.
       Warning   NetScape Communicator Users: I have found that there is a
        bug in Communicator. When using the remote control options of the
         Microscopy and/or Macroscope, Communicator disconnects the live
        video feed from the server. You will have to "RELOAD" and/or just
                            switch back to Navigator
       Microsoft Internet Explorer will NOT display any live video images
          from the TPM Site, you will however be able to view all text
         information using Microsoft's Product, but will not be able to
                    participate in any interactive sessions.

        The TelePresence Microscopy Site has been optimized for operation
        on a 1024 x 768 Computer Monitor. You should also be operating in
       16-bit color mode (Thousands of Colors), if you are running in only
       8 bit mode (256 colors) then you will observe a degradation of the
          image quality. This may manifest itself as a segmentation or
       intensity layering effect and other related artifacts. If you reset
          your monitor to a larger bit depth remember to quit your WWW
        Browser and restart the program in-order to properly reinitialize
                                 its color map.
         Should you select a smaller size screen then you will have less
          functionality implemented, however, the live images should be
         displayed without clipping. If you are connecting using a modem
       connection to the Internet be forewarned that the Live Video images
       that this site is broadcasting will not be displayed in real time.
        You will need at least an ISDN line to view the images at even a
                           fraction of near live time.
