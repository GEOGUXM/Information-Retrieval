    EDUCATOR RESOURCE CENTER

   20,000 students will learn about current science research when their
   teachers learn to utilize the resources available at the NASA Educator
   Resource Center at Ames Research Center.

   You provide the very important link between information and classroom
   teachers. Train teachers how to use the Internet, inform them of the
   latest curriculum designed for their classrooms, assist at NASA
   educational workshops.

   Become a Docent at the Educator Resource Center and become aware of the
   wealth of information available to those in the know. Increase your
   knowledge through training and private tours for Team NASA volunteers.

   Call for information about program times.

    AMES AEROSPACE ENCOUNTER

   What is it like to be an astronaut, design an airplane, gaze at a rock
   from the moon? The Ames Aerospace Encounter provides the environment
   for 4th, 5th, and 6th grade students to try out all these experiences
   and more.

   You can be their docent guide on a 3 hour science, space, and
   technology adventure.

   Become a docent at the Ames Aerospace Encounter and you will have an
   opportunity to learn about the research being done here at the Ames
   Research Center through training and private tours for Team NASA
   volunteers.

   Ames Aerospace Encounter holds its programs Monday through Friday
