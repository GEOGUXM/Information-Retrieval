Computational Bioscience and Engineering Laboratory
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Computational Bioscience and Engineering Laboratory (CBEL) is a
   research and development organization that provides engineering and
   computer science expertise to support biomedical research activities at
   the National Institutes of Health.

   CBEL applies image processing and medical imaging technologies,
   high-performance parallel computing, high-speed networking, signal
   processing, state-of-the-art optical and electronic devices,
   bioinformatics, database technology, mathematical and statistical
   techniques, and modern hardware and software engineering principles to
   help solve biomedical research problems at NIH.

   CBEL presently has projects in positron emission tomography and
   electron paramagnetic resonance imaging, virtual endoscopy, virus
   structure determination using electron microscopy, three-dimension
   echocardiography visualization, protein structure determination using
   x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,
   computational radiotherapy, telemedicine with high resolution imaging,
   cDNA microarray analysis, human genetic linkage analysis, laser capture
   tissue microdissection and chromosome microdissection instrumentation
   systems design, cancer genome anatomy data visualization and storage,
   and computationally intensive statistical applications.
