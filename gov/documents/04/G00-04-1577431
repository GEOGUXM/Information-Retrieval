   Goddard Space Flight Centers Instrument Remote Control (IRC) project is
   an ongoing effort led by the Advanced Architectures and Automation
   Branch (Code 588). IRC supports NASAs mission by defining an adaptive
   framework that provides robust interactive and distributed control and
   monitoring of remote instruments. IRC technology will be used in an
   operational environment for the SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for
   Infrared Astronomy) project. SOFIA uses a Boeing 747-SP aircraft
   modified to accommodate a 2.5 meter reflecting telescope. SOFIA will be
   the largest airborne telescope in the world.
