                     Chemical Kinetics and Photochemical
              Data for Stratospheric Modeling -- Evaluation 13
            Supplement to Evaluation 12: Update of Key Reactions
                          JPL Publication No. 00-3

       Modeling stratospheric processes -- with particular emphasis on
                            possible ozone layer
     perturbations due to anthropogenic and natural phenomena -- is this
                         data's primary application.
   Evaluation 13 updates and supplements Evaluation 12; both documents may
             be downloaded.  New: Download Evaluation 13 Errata.
      This is the NASA Panel for Data Evaluation's 13th evaluated rate
                constant and photochemical cross section set.
