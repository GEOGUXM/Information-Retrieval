                              Mission Statement

    The mission of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
    Coral Health and Monitoring Program(CHAMP) is to provide services to
      help improve and sustain coral reef health throughout the world.

                          Our long term goals are:

     * Establish an international network of coral reef researchers for
       the purpose of sharing knowledge and information on coral health
       and monitoring.
     * Provide near real-time data products derived from satellite images
       and monitoring stations at coral reef areas.
     * Provide a data repository for historical data collected from coral
       reef areas.
     * Add to the general fund of coral reef knowledge.
