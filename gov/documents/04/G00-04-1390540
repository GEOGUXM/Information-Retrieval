                                Introduction

   The Fluid Dynamics Group (T-3) has a long history of innovation in the
      field of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A number of standard
     numerical techniques (such as PIC, MAC, ICE, and ALE methods) were
     developed in T-3 during the late 1950's and the 1960's. Now, in the
   1990's, T-3 continues to be active at the forefront of developments in
        CFD numerical techniques, applications, and physics modeling.

    A more detailed narrative of the history and present research in T-3
   can be found in a manuscript entitled "The Legacy and Future of CFD at
   Los Alamos" (385Kb pdf file) and in the related viewgraphs presented by
    group member Norman L. Johnson at the 1996 Canadian CFD Conference in
                        June, 1996 (881Kb pdf file).
