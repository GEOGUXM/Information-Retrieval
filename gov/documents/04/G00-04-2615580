   You can find general information about the TSP on this Web site.  If
   you are participating in the TSP, you can also obtain information about
   your individual TSP account in the Account Access section.  To do so,
   you will need your Social Security number and your 4-digit TSP Personal
   Identification Number (PIN).  If you do not know your PIN, you can
   request a new one in that section.

   The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, which administers the
   TSP, maintains another Web site, www.frtib.gov, which provides
   information about the FRTIB electronic reading room, procurements, and
   employment opportunities.
