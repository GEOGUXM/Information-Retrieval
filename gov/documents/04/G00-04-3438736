   As the holiday season approaches and 2001comes to an end, it is
   important for us to think about the true priorities of life. Now is the
   time to focus on friends and family, and to show our love and
   appreciation for them.

   While I am saddened by the tragic events our country has endured over
   the last several months, I am pleased that we have bonded together and
   pledged to prevent this from happening again. Our nation will continue
   to prevail. We will remain a nation committed to preserving peace,
   hope, justice, and liberty. Our flame of freedom will continue to burn
   for the whole world to see. We will continue to be a symbol of hope to
   all nations who look to us for leadership.

   I am proud to see Nevadans uniting, lifting each other up, and helping
   one another in this time of national need. It is an honor to serve you
   at this critical time in our nation's history. I am committed to
   defending the freedom and security of our nation at all costs and to
   ensuring that those Americans who lost their lives did not do so in
   vain. I want to encourage you to continue to join together, supporting
   one another through these challenging times.

   Best wishes to all and hope for a joyous New Year.
