   Welcome to NOAA's Web Site on the licensing of commercial remote
   sensing satellite systems. This Web Site is intended to provide U.S.
   laws, regulations, policies, and related information pertaining to the
   operation of commercial remote sensing satellite systems.

   Pursuant to the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act and Administration
   policy on foreign access to remote sensing space capabilities,
   responsibilities have been delegated from the Secretary of Commerce to
   the Assistant Administrator of NOAA's National Environmental Satellite,
   Data, and Information Service (NOAA/NESDIS) for the licensing of
   companies to operate private space-based remote sensing systems.

   NOAA/NESDIS encourages consultation meetings with potential applicants
   before a license application is submitted. These meetings will be
   informal and are not considered part of the agency record of an
   application.

   For questions, additional information, or to arrange for a
   pre-application consultation, please contact Timothy Stryker, Acting
   Remote Sensing Licensing Coordinator, at (301) 713-2024 x.205, or by
   e-mail at Timothy.Stryker@noaa.gov.
