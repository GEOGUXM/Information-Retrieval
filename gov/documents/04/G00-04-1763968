   elcome to the Center for Health Care Evaluation web site. The Center
   for Health Care Evaluation (CHCE) is an applied health services
   research group composed of individuals trained in health services,
   health economics, epidemiology, public health, evaluation research,
   social psychology, medical sociology, and biostatistics. We have
   primary affiliations with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
   Health Care System and Stanford University School of Medicine in Palo
   Alto, California. The Center is also affiliated with the Institute for
   Health Policy at the University of California in San Francisco and with
   the Alcohol Research Group and the Center for Mental Health Services
   Research at the University of California in Berkeley.
   CHCE's mission is to conduct and disseminate health services research
   that results in more effective and cost-effective care for veterans and
   for the nation's population as a whole. We work to develop an
   integrated body of knowledge about health care and to help the VA and
   the broader health care community plan and adapt to changes associated
   with health care reform.

   In order to achieve this mission, we have the following goals:
     * Improve the organization and delivery of health care services; we
       identify how to organize health care services to best meet
       patients' needs
     * Improve diagnostic assessment, screening procedures, and clinical
       decisionmaking; to aid staff in clinical practice, we refine
       clinical decisionmaking techniques and examine the effectiveness
       and cost-effectiveness of diagnostic methods and treatment
     * Improve treatment for substance use and psychiatric disorders; we
       find out what treatments work and how to match patients to the best
       treatment for their condition
     * Improve health services research methods; to better attain our
       other goals, we improve techniques for measuring program
       characteristics, health status and outcomes, and costs

   In planning our research in these four areas, we have a vision of an
   effective health care system. In addition to the broad principles of
   access, quality, and cost-effectiveness, we think health care should:
     * Consider the whole person, including psychosocial and life context
       factors and primary as well as secondary and tertiary prevention
     * Inform patients and enable them to be active partners in choosing,
       planning, and maintaining care
     * Establish continuity and coordination of care across treatment
       settings and providers
     * Use outcome-based practice guidelines to match patients with
       effective treatment and deliver personalized care guided by
       flexible standards of care
     * Encompass informal systems of care, such as mutual help groups,
       volunteers, and family caregivers
     * Create an effective work environment for health care staff
