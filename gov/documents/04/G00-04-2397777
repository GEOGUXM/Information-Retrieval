   Waiver Request Form for U.S. and Foreign-Registered Aircraft Operations
             Restricted by U.S. NOTAMs after September 11, 2001
   General aviation and corporate operators of U.S. and foreign-registered
    aircraft affected by U.S. NOTAM restrictions following the terrorist
       attacks on September 11, 2001 can request permission for flight
    operations to the U.S. from international locations and from the U.S.
      to international locations by submitting a waiver form. After you
      submit your waiver request, we ask that you not call the FAA Air
    Traffic Customer Advocate Office to inquire about the status of your
    request unless you are within 24 hours of the Date Waiver Needed you
      specified on the form. Calls to the FAA slow the waiver approval
       process. The FAA is prioritizing and processing the most urgent
   requests first. Your waiver request will be processed and faxed to you
    on or before the date you specify. Please submit requests seven days
             ahead of the date needed, as explained on the form.

                           Southern Africa Project
   The FAA and the International Air Transport Association are cooperating
      on a project to assist 14 Southern African Development Community
   countries and Kenya to improve flight safety in the region by providing
       flight inspection services. Flight inspection is the process of
   ensuring that ground-based equipment essential to navigation, take-off
         and landing is operating correctly. The U.S. Department of
   Transportation is funding the project through its Safe Skies for Africa
                                 initiative.

                        Ron Brown Airfield Initiative
       The FAA has a partnership with the National Imagery and Mapping
    Agency's Ron Brown Airfield Initiative. The goal of the initiative is
      to raise the level of navigational safety at approximately 1,000
    airports around the world by cooperating with aviation authorities in
    many countries and international aviation organizations. Digital maps
     of the airports will help develop flight procedures using satellite
                  navigation at airports around the globe.
