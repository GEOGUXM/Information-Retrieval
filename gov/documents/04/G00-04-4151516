   LLMPP Mission:
   The Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project is using Lymphochip
       cDNA microarrays to define the gene expression profiles of all
       types of human lymphoid malignancies. One primary goal of this
       Project is to redefine the classification of human lymphoid
       malignancies in molecular terms. A second major goal is to define
       molecular correlates of clinical parameters which can be used in
       prognosis and in the selection of appropriate therapy for these
       patients.

   Project, contact:
