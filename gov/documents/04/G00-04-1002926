   Our group, under the leadership of Dr. Hank Crawford, studies particle
   interactions in nuclear, high energy, and astrophysics experiments.
   [star_tnb.gif] STAR (Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC): particle production
   in the Big Bang [transport_tnb.gif] Transport: Measure nuclear
   interaction cross sections relevant to cosmic ray transport from
   sources to Earth
   [e896_tnb.gif] E896: Search for short-lived composite strange matter
   [e878_tnb.gif] E878: Investigate antinucleus production in order to
   understand origins of cosmic ray nuclei
   [gmsd_tnb.gif] GMSD: Gas microstructure detectors for gamma-ray and
   x-ray astronomy [e866_tnb.gif] E866: Investigate strange particle
   production in relativistic heavy ion collisions
   [nube_tnb.gif] Neutrino Burst: deep ocean detector for ultra high
   energy neutrinos from the most energetic events in the universe
