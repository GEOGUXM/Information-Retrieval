   months of intense evaluation, those selected are provided with
   opportunities to advance in a Federal public service career path. For
   decades, the NIH has attracted highly motivated candidates who today
   hold various senior management positions in NIH.  This experience
   provides incredible and unique opportunities for career advancement
