    The USGS provides maps, reports, and information to help others meet
    their needs to manage, develop, and protect America's water, energy,
    mineral, and land resources. We help find natural resources needed to
     build tomorrow, and supply scientific understanding needed to help
    minimize or mitigate the effects of natural hazards and environmental
   damage caused by human activities. The results of our efforts touch the
                    daily lives of almost every American.
