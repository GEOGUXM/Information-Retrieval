                                 Mail Alert

    The mail delivery system in the U.S. Congress is improving, but mail
    deliveries are still a little slow. Mail sent to my Washington, D.C.,
   office in October is finally being received and will be responded to as
   soon as possible.  Recently-sent mail is also being delivered; however,
    I would still encourage Idahoans to use phone, FAX and e-mail to send
     me any timely messages. Thanks for your patience and understanding
   during this time! I do appreciate the time you take to let me know how
   you feel about issues of concern. Thank you for your understanding and
                                  patience.

                                 Mike Crapo
