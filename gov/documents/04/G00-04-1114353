      The Intramural Research Program's Scientific Retreat provides an
    opportunity for NIMH & NINDS Fellows and Investigators to learn and
        discuss the science being done throughout the two IRPs in an
           informal, social environment. All NIMH & NINDS Fellows
     (Post-doctoral, Visiting, Research, Clinical, Post-baccalaureate,
        Technical) and Investigators are invited to participate. The
        two-and-a-half day event is co-sponsored by the Fellows' IRP
           Committee and the NIMH Office of Fellowship Training.

    This year's retreat will feature four Guest Lecturers as well as the
     New Investigators Forum with Dr. Plenz of NIMH and Dr. Diamond of
      NINDS. "Life after Fellowship" is the topic for the small group
    discussion. A panel discussion will focus on Neuroinformatics. This
    year, at the Monday evening banquet, the Institutes' Directors, Drs.
     Steven Hyman and Gerald Fischbach, will provide keynote talks. The
     NIMH Outstanding Mentor Award and the Seymour S. Kety Outstanding
            Fellow Awards will also be presented Monday evening.

      There is no charge to participants; all that is required is the
        submission of an abstract for a poster or oral presentation.
     Post-baccalaureate and Technical Fellows who do not want to submit
      an abstract may attend the retreat on just Monday, September 25.
       Transportation will be provided to and from NIH and the Airlie
                    Center on Monday for those who wish.

    On behalf of the IRP Fellows' Committee, welcome to this year's home
                                   page!
