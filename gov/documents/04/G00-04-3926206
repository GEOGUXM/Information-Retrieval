   USDA - Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is committed to making its
   web sites accessible to all USDA customers and employees. All of the
   agency web sites are undergoing review and redesign as necessary to
   ensure that they meet or exceed the requirements of Section 508 of the
   Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

   Many of our web sites currently meet the Section 508 accessibility
   standards. Furthermore, USDA - Agricultural Research Service (ARS)
   continues to work on making all web sites accessible. Thank you very
   much for your patience through this redesign process. If you have any
   comments or suggestions for improvement, please contact the Web Master
   of this page.
