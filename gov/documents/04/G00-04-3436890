   This is the distribution server for ups and upd products at Fermilab

   Information on its configuration is available, as are log summaries.

   The main ftp server ftp.fnal.gov is resident on this system, which
   provides anonymous access to Fermitools files, and access to registered
   hosts for general Fermilab software. The online registration form is
   available, as is a page to check if someplace is registered.

   For product maintainers, there is also a page to check who has
   downloaded a given ups product, and a script to check if you are
   registered to use upd addproduct.

   Two special-permission ftp servers allow access for U.S. Government
   Only products and Export Restricted products; which will give users
   "permission denied" errors on hosts that we do not know for certain are
   U.S. sites. These let us deal appropriately with licensing and export
   restrictions on software distribution.
