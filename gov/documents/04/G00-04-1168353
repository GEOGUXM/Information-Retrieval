   The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory's
   Subsurface Science Initiative (SSI) is a major research undertaking to
   expand our understanding of subsurface contaminant fate and transport
   in order to develop and validate reliable predictive models. These
   models are a critical component of decision-making to choose
   environmental remediation and long-term stewardship options.

   This research effort encompasses a broad range of scientific inquiry
   needed to address the Department of Energy's nationwide environmental
   management needs. A world-class peer review board and recommendations
   from the National Research Council help guide the Subsurface Science
   Initiative research program.

   We are developing new research capabilities and recruiting staff to
   advance subsurface investigation. Multidisciplinary research teams are
   now conducting mesoscale experimental campaigns designed to mimic
   complex real-world hydrological, microbiological, geochemical and
   geological subsurface processes. Additionally, we are planning a
   Subsurface Geosciences Laboratory user facility to enable experimental
   verification of predictive models.

   The Subsurface Science Initiative creates an exciting opportunity for
   scientists, engineers, and students to work in collaboration with INEEL
   personnel on cutting-edge research into problems whose solutions are
   important for ensuring a clean, safe environment for humanity and all
   life on earth.  Explore the opportunities and promises of the SSI
   through this web site.
