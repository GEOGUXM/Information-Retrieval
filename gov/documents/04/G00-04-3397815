   [usdalogo1.jpg] The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS),
   formerly the Soil Conservation Service, is the federal government
   agency that works hand-in-hand with the American people to conserve
   natural resources on private lands.  Using our scientific and technical
   expertise, and our partnerships with soil and water conservation
   districts and others, we help people conserve all natural resources on
   private lands.
