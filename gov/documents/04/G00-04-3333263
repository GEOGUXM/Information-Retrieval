   The Medium Energy Physics group in the Physics Division of Argonne
   National Laboratory emphasizes the study of nuclear processes in which
   the constituents of the nucleon are revealed. The thrusts of the
   research program are:

The Hermes Experiment at DESY.

   HERMES measures the interaction of polarized 25-30 GeV positrons with
   polarized internal targets of hydrogen, deuterium and Helium-3. The
   measurements focus on the deep inelastic spin structure functions of
   the nucleon and polarization observables in vector meson production and
   elastic scattering from deuterium. In 1995 the experiment is running
   with polarized positrons on a polarized Helium-3 target. In 1996, the
   polarized hydrogen target will be installed. The polarization of the
   sea will be measured using asymmetries of events with charged hadrons
   detected in coincidence with the scattered positrons.

JLAB Experiments.

   We are involved in a variety of experiments at JLAB (formerly CEBAF),
   including measurements of (e,e'p), (e,e'pi) , and (e,e'K) reactions and
   gamma+d-->p+n. Most of these experiments are performed in Hall C at
   JLAB. Argonne was responsible for the construction of the Short Orbit
   Spectrometer which is one of the two initial spectrometers in Hall C.

Optical Methods in Nuclear Physics.

   Argonne has developed a widely applicable, ultra-sensitive method (Atom
   Trap Trace Analysis, or ATTA) for analyzing trace isotopes at the
   parts-per-trillion level. The ATTA method is based on laser
   manipulation of neutral atoms with a table-top laser to slow, trap, and
   count atoms of interest.

E866 at FNAL.

   E866 measures the difference between the u and the d antiquark sea in
   the proton by measuring the Drell-Yan Process, production of virtual
   photons by the annihilation of quark-antiquark pairs in 800 GeV proton
   reactions on hydrogen and deuterium. This experiment collected data
   from the summer of 1996 to the summer of 1997. Additional measurements
   include the muon decay angular distributions of J/Psi production and
   the nuclear dependence of Drell-Yan cross sections.

   A letter of intent has been submitted to FNAL to push these Drell-Yan
   measurements to higher x values using the 120 GeV proton beams from the
   FNAL main injector.
