      BOLD NEW VISION PROPOSED FOR NASA AMES:
      NASA RESEARCH PARK

   Artist illustration of NASA Research Park campus
   In the heart of the Silicon Valley, NASA is planning to develop a
   world-class, shared-use educational and R&D campus at Moffett Field,
   California, that will focus on:

     We want to invite our partners in to help, because we have seen over
     and over again the benefits of NASA's longterm, high-risk research. If
     you are willing to work on revolutionary technology leaps that are both
     critical to our missions and will be productive for your universities
     or profitable for your companies, we'll provide the buildings and land
     to do it at Ames.

     Dr. Henry McDonald
     NASA Ames Research Center Director


   As part of the NASA Ames Development Plan, NASA officials plan to
   create partnerships with federal, state and local government agencies,
   universities, private industry and non-profit organizations in support
   of NASA's mission to conduct research and develop new technologies.

   DEVELOPMENT PLAN

   The plan includes the proposed development of four areas:

     NASA Research Park: A 213-acre parcel located between Ames Research
     Center (ARC) facilities, Moffett Federal Airfield, U.S. Highway 101
     and the U.S. Air Force military housing area.

     Eastside/Airfield District: A 952-acre parcel that includes Moffett
     Federal Airfield and property located east of the airfield.

     Bay View District: A 95-acre parcel located north of the Ames
     Research Center facilities.

     Ames Research Center Facilities: A 234-acre parcel comprising the
     existing NASA Ames Research Center campus.

   EXCITING INTERACTIVE CENTERS BEING PLANNED

   California Air and Space Center, Coming Soon!

   Computer History Museum: Open Now!
