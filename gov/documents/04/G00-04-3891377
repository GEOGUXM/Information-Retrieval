      Welcome to the GPS Applications Exchange, an online information
   source on the diverse uses of GPS technology all over the world. GPS is
   a public information service used by both the public and private
   sectors of our global economy to improve productivity, increase safety
   and protect the environment. Sponsored by NASA and representatives of
   the GPS community the Applications Exchange includes GPS application
   stories that you can browse and view by application type or by country.
   You can also access these applications by regions using the map below.
   Use the pull-down menus on this page to learn about the innovative ways
   that GPS is being put to work.
      We want the GPS Applications Exchange to grow! If you know of an
   interesting GPS application that isnt listed on this site, please tell
   us about it. We are also eager to spread the word about this valuable
   resource. Please tell your colleagues about the site and encourage them
   to submit their applications as well.
