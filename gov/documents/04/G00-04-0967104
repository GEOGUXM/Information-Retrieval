   The above images are of a dense molecular cloud where stars are being
   formed. The image at left is from the Second Palomar Observatory Sky
   Survey (POSS-II) red and blue plates, while the right image is from the
   Two Micron All Sky Survey. The cloud is nearly opaque at visible
   wavelengths, but is transparent in the infrared. We can see a number of
   newborn stars in the infrared, including the bright orange-red star
   just to the left of center (which is completely invisible in the left
   image - compare the star positions carefully!): this star is believed
   to be only a few hundred thousand years old.

                    Welcome to irastro/cougar/mirlinlab.

   [mirlin3_tiny.jpg] The principal reason for this page's existence is to
   provide a pointer to information about MIRLIN, a mid-infrared
   astronomical camera we have developed at JPL.

   forming debris disk which we imaged with MIRLIN at the Keck II
   telescope, click on the picture to the left.
