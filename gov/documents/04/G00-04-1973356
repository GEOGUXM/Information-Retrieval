   Frederick County Carbonate Aquifer Appraisal Website to view
   ground-water levels and streamflow data and to learn more about this
   study being conducted by USGS and Frederick County. Results of this

   important water resource in the Northern Shenandoah Valley.

   USGS, NPS Study Water Quality at Civil War Sites

   [DSCN0180test1.jpg] January 2002: Roger Moberg, hydrologic technician,
   prepares to grab a water sample from this small tributary to the James
   River in the Malvern Hill unit of Richmond National Battlefield Park.
   USGS is collecting water-quality data in several park units. The
   National Park Service will use the information to develop a plan for
   managing and protecting the streams and wetlands of these historically
   significant Civil War battlefields. For more information

   Southern Appalachian Conference

   Appalachian conference session October 2001: USGS scientists from
   Virginia participated in a workshop in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, to share
   information about the Southern Appalachian region. The region is unique
   in North America in its abundance of ecological diversity and natural
   resources. Participants gathered to develop new collaborative
   opportunities and to explore the results of previous or ongoing
   scientific investigations. Abstracts of selected presentations.

   Geological Field Conference Studies Effects of an Ancient Impact

   Impact crater geology field trip, Oct 2001 Oct. 20: Personnel from
   USGS, Virginia state agencies (DEQ, VDMR), universities and private
   industry attended this field trip, led by Gerald Johnson, College of
   William and Mary; David Powars, USGS; and Scott Bruce, DEQ. Attendees
   visited sites that show the effects of the impact, 35 million years
   ago, of a comet or asteroid that fell into the Atlantic Ocean near Cape
   Charles. The bluffs in the photo are along the north bank of the James
   River, on the grounds of the historic Carter's Grove farm, just outside
   the outer rim of the impact crater. The bluffs reveal a geologic
   formation known as the Yorktown Formation. These strata reflect
   intermittent movement (faulting) around the buried rim of the impact
   structure.
