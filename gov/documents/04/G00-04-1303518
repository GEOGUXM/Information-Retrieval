     __________________________________________________________________

   The Science Information System (SIS) is an automated query system
   established by the Chief Biologist, Biological Resources Division -
   (BRD), to provide rapid access to BRD Scientific Areas and Programs
   data at the project level. The SIS is designed to meet the information
   needs of scientists and resource managers -- both within the BRD and in
   partner organizations, client agencies, and interest groups.

   The SIS may be accessed and queried on the World Wide Web at
   http://cris.csrees.usda.gov/star/brd.html.

   The SIS provides information at the project level for BRD programs. A
   project is the smallest segment into which BRD science is divided; it
   is the level at which hypotheses are tested or specific questions are
   addressed. A project has a specific objective, which does not change
   over the life of the project, and a finite duration (i.e., well-defined
   start and end dates), and results in a specific end product or
   products. Projects are technically distinct in scope, objective, and
   duration from other science efforts, with which they may be aggregated
   for financial, administrative, or contracting purposes.
