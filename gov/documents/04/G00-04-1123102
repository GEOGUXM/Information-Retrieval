     EDUCATION PROGRAMS

   Staff at Los Alamos National Laboratory recognize that in order to
   maintain and cultivate a well-educated workforce, we must provide a
   quality learning environment for graduate, undergraduate and high
   school students. The expectation is that we will successfully influence
   career objectives. The Education Program Office (STB/EPO) strives to
   achieve this goal by providing internship opportunities through
   programs that will add meaningful work experiences that incorporate
   education and training activities.
