   Several multi-mission tools are in development and use for real-time,
   hardware-in-the-loop simulations for testing and verification of flight
   software and hardware.

   Tools:


   DARTS A high performance computational engine for flexible multibody
   dynamics. Adapted to develop NEIMO package for internal coordinates
   molecular dyanmics simulations. Winner of 1997 NASA Software Award
   Dshell A multi-mission simulation environment for real-time,
   hardware-in-the-loop spacecraft simulations.

   libSim A modeling and simulation framework for the development of
   spacecraft subsystem and hardware models.

   Research:

   Spatial Operator Algebra The Spatial Operator Algebra (SOA) is a new
   mathematical framework for the analysis of flexible multibody systems.
   References Publications on the topic of Spatial Operator Algebra (SOA).
