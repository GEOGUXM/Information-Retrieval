               NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions

Introduction

   Undoubtedly you are familiar with Abramowitz and Stegun's, Handbook of
   Mathematical Functions (with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical
   Tables), first published by the National Bureau of Standards in 1964,
   and still in print.

   A project is underway at the National Institute of Standards and
   Technology (the heir to NBS) to develop a replacement for the Handbook.
   This will be a major new mathematical reference source on the World
   Wide Web for special functions and their applications.

  About the project

   For more information about the project, see the Project web pages;
   including Upcoming Events and What's New! New!

Digital Library of Mathematical Functions Mockup

   Finally, we present the Mockup of NIST's Digital Library of
   Mathematical Functions. This mockup gives an idea of the current ideas
   about the design and organization of the new Digital Library; these
   ideas are, of course, subject to change. Content only is only available
   in a few places -- it is only a mockup. Give it a look, and give us
   your responses.

  Starting points:

     * Table of Contents
     * Search for keywords.
     * Help about the site.

     * Internal Pages for project members only.
