   This is NASA's official web site for news and information about the
   space agency's Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST), a powerful space
   telescope that will replace the highly successful Hubble Space
   Telescope (HST) when it retires near the end of this decade. Scheduled
   for launch in 2009, the telescope will carry cameras and spectrographs
   sensitive to infrared radiation. Over the telescope's 5-10 year
   lifetime astronomers hope to observe the farthest reaches of the
   universe.
