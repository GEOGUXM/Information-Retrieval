    The JPL High Performance Computing Group's mission is to advance the
   state-of-the-art in effective high performance computing technology for
   the NASA engineering and science community. The HPC Group maintains
   work in parallel algorithm development (activities that involve working
   with NASA Grand Challenge Teams), modeling and design of observational
   instruments,and in the development of parallel computer systems.
   Opportunities exist within and outside of NASA for collaboration with
   the HPC Group.

   The JPL High Performance Computing Group is a member of the Imaging and
   Spectrometry Systems Technology Section (385), within the Observational
   Systems Division (38).
