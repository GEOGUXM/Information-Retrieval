                     Celebrating America's Century Farms
   [transparent.gif] [transparent.gif] [transparent.gif]
   With a new century upon us, we celebrate American farms that have
   stayed in one family's hands for all of the last century or even
   longer.  These farms, which we call Century Farms, provide a window
   into both the history and the diversity of American agriculture.

   Accepting many risks, adapting to changing technologies, and enduring
   tremendous upheaval, these Century Farms -- and thousands like them
   around the country -- have built a remarkable family tradition, but
   they also remain, to this day, productive and vibrant economic
   entities.

   We have established this web site as an effort to both honor and
   catalogue the thousands of Century Farms that are such a integral part
   of this Nation's heritage, and it's economy.  We invite you to explore
   this site, and to find out how your farm and ranch can apply for
   recognition under the Century Farms project.  We hope that in the
   process you will learn about the history of these Century Farms -- and
   all the farms and ranches that make up the fabric of American
   Agriculture -- and why they make ours the safest, most abundant and
   affordable food supply on Earth!

      The American farmer, living on his own land, remains our ideal of
       self-reliance and spiritual balance - the source from which the
   reservoirs of our nation's strength are constantly renewed." President
