      Statement by Under Secretary Mark Rey, Sierra Nevada Forest Plan
      Amendment Appeals
      WASHINGTON December 27, 2001--"Yesterday I completed my examination of
      the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment appeals to determine if
      departmental discretionary review of Forest Service Chief Dale

      Bosworth's decision and his instructions to the Pacific Southwest
      regional forester. Therefore, I will not conduct a discretionary
      review."
