   WRDA Funding: A Crucial Step In Saving Louisianas Coast

   For nearly 70 years Louisianas complex system of coastal marshes,
   waterways, lakes and barrier islands has been radically changed by the
   influence of man and industry. While land subsidence and sea level rise
   have taken their toll, the development of oil and gas resources, the
   shipping industry and flood control levees have exacted a price as
   well. Countless channels and canals have been carved through protective
   reefs and deep into freshwater wetlands, redirecting flows and
   providing avenues for salt-bearing tides. Spoil banks and levees have
   isolated marshes from their natural supplies of fresh water, sediment
   and nutrients, causing vegetation to fail and exposing a weakened
   environment to erosion. As a result, this remarkable ecosystem is being
   converted to open water at the rate of 25 to 35 square miles a yearthe
   equivalent of a football field every 30 minutesputting southern
   Louisiana on track to lose 1,000 additional square miles of coastal
   wetlands by the year 2050.

   CWPPRA
   Louisiana is blessed with an abundance of natural resources.
   Approximately 40 percent of the coastal wetlands of the lower 48 states
   is located in Louisiana.

   This fragile environment is disappearing at an alarming rate. Louisiana
   has lost up to 40 square miles of marsh a year for several decades -
   that's 80 percent of the nation's annual coastal wetland loss. If the
   current rate of loss is not slowed, by the year 2040 an additional
   800,000 acres of wetlands will disappear, and the Louisiana shoreline
   will advance inland as much as 33 miles in some areas.

   This prompted Congress to pass the Coastal Wetlands Planning,
   Protection and Restoration Act (CWPPRA) in 1990. It funds wetland
   enhancement projects nationwide, designating approximately $50 million
   annually for work in Louisiana.

   Project List
   The CWPPRA Taskforce annually develops a list of high-priority projects
   to be constructed. To date, ten such priority lists have been
   formulated. The projects funded by CWPPRA all focus on marsh creation,
   restoration, protection or enhancement.

   Site
   The Louisiana Coastal Wetlands Conservation and Restoration Task Force
   web site contains information and links relating to coastal restoration
   projects in coastal Louisiana.
