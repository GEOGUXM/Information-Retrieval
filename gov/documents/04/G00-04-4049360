The Catalog of Infrared Observations (CIO) Version 5.1 is a database of over
396,000 published infrared observations of more than 64,000 individual
astronomical sources over the wavelength range from 1 to 1000 microns.
Version 5.1 includes observations published through 1998. The last printed
edition of the Catalog (Third Edition) was released in June 1993 as NASA
Reference Publication RP-1294.

1. Access the Catalog Data

   There are three ways to interactively access the data in the on-line
   Catalog: 1) Browse the Catalog (scroll through the Catalog listings),
   2) Access the Catalog data by source name, or 3) Search the Catalog
   listings by specifying position/wavelength/flux. You can also access
   the database of bibliographic references for each Catalog data entry by
   searching the bibliography of journal articles from which the catalog
   data were obtained.

2. Access the Atlas of Infrared Sources

   It can be difficult to locate a source in the Catalog by its name,
   because source names are not standardized and are often abbreviated in
   the database. However, all of the object names contained in the
   database are listed alphabetically in an Atlas of Infrared Sources,
   which is a supporting tool built into the Catalog.

   Click on the red button to find the source name in the Atlas, and link
   to its location in the Catalog. You can then scroll up and down to
   identify records corresponding to the source. Obviously, this option
   does not restrict the results to any particular source, but does
   provide an efficient way to find the source in the Catalog.

3. Access the Bibliography

   You can view the collection of journal articles from which the Catalog
   data were obtained, arranged alphabetically by first author. The
   listing includes the title of the paper and the bibliographic reference
   number. From the CIO Search Page you can search the bibliographic
   database by typing in a bibliographic reference number.

   Select the button corresponding to the last name of the first author:

   [A] [B] [C] [D] [E] [F] [G] [H] [I] [J] [K] [L] [M]
   [N] [O] [P] [Q] [R] [S] [T] [U] [V] [W] [X] [Y] [Z]

4. Supporting Material

   [Help] CIO Help Page
   [Intro] User's Manual for the Catalog of Infrared Observations and
   database
   [Download] Download the Catalog of Infrared Observations data files.
   (NOTE: It is not necessary to download the data files in order to
   access the Catalog. You can access all of the Catalog data directly
   from this Website using option #1 above.) Use this option to download
   any of the database files to your computer for local processing and
   analysis.

   The CIO (v. 3.5) is available on CD-ROM from the ADC (Astronomical Data
   Center). It is included in their CD-ROM Selected Astronomical Catalogs
   Vol. 3. [Link to ADC CD-ROM page]

   The search engine for this site was designed by Terry Beck, (Advanced
   Computer Concepts, Inc.) using MySql; under contract with NASA/Goddard
   Space Flight Center, Laboratory for Astronomy and Solar Physics (LASP).

   Special thanks are due to Dan Kodesh, formerly of NASA/Goddard Space
   Flight Center and Global Science & Technology Inc., who designed the
   original Search Page software using ObjectStore at the Applied
   Information Sciences Branch (Code 935) at NASA/Goddard Space Flight
   Center, and to Bob Cromp, formerly of Code 935.

   Version 4 of the CIO was created with the help of Mila Airapetian,
   Velma Greenlee, Leonid Marochnik, and Denise Proctor, of Computer
   Sciences Corporation.

   We made use of two invaluable resources to locate positions and verify
   identifications of astronomical objects: 1) Set of Identifications,
   Measurements and Bibliography for Astronomical Data (SIMBAD) of the
   Centre de Données Astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS), 2) NASA
   Extragalactic Database (NED), a service of the Infrared Processing and
   Analysis Center (IPAC)

   IRAS Point Source Catalog cross-identifications and flux data for
   version 5.1 were obtained from CATSCAN, another excellent IPAC utility

   Some of the icons used on the CIO Web pages were obtained from The
   Graphic Station, The Icon Browser, Pam Bytes Free Web Graphics, Randy's
   Icon Bazaar
