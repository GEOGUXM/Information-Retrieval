   USGS Streamgage Enhanced

                          Stream gage centennial
   August 27: Congressman Bob Goodlatte joined USGS Virginia District
   personnel in celebrating the centennial of a USGS streamgage in
   Roanoke, Va. This gage, which has been in operation since 1899, and 13
   others in Virginia have been upgraded in the past two years with a
   real-time data system. The improvement in the data availability will
   aid the National Weather Service in warning people more quickly about
   rising floodwaters. Floods and Droughts in Roanoke, Virginia (In Adobe

   Getting to the Bottom of an Impact Crater

   Drill rig in Mathews County July 2001: USGS is beginning the arduous
   task of drilling another corehole into the Chesapeake Bay impact
   crater. Just beyond the drill rig in the photo is the Bay, underneath
   which lies much of the central portion of this large, buried impact
   crater created 35 million years ago. Despite the mud and mosquitoes
   that prevail in this part of Virginia in the summer, USGS scientists
   are excited about this corehole—it's the closest to the crater's center
   that goes all the way to bedrock, and is expected to yield a wealth of
   data about the ground water of southeastern Va. For more information.
