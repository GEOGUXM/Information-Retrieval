   This program locates novel RNA genes based on the premise that all
   stable, functional RNAs share common structural elements and that
   sequences corresponding to these elements would occur preferentially in
   RNA genes. These structural elements include double helices, GNRA
   tetraloops, uridine turns, and non-Watson Crick mispairs in a symmetric
   internal loop. Also UNCG tetraloops, tetraloop receptors and adenosine
   platforms are expected to occur in higher frequency in RNA genes and
   thus to be useful for their identification. Initially neural networks
   have been trained to recognize RNA genes in E. coli. Since neural
   networks based on the occurrence of RNA structural elements can not be
   expected to identify non-RNA sequences in a positive manner, we used
   additional sequence based neural networks based on global sequence
   descriptors (previously applied to protein fold prediction) to
   discriminate RNA genes from non-RNA genes.
   We have used 6 structural parameters for RNA gene prediction:
     * number of UNCG tetraloops;
     * GNRA tetraloops;
     * uridine turns;
     * tetraloop receptors;
     * CTAG tetramers
     * the calculated free energy of folding.

   The Sequence based descriptors include:
     * 4 composition parameters - the number of A, C, G, T bases;
     * 16 transition parameters, (dinucleotide frequency).

   The structure based and sequence based neural networks are trained on
   very different parameters and therefore can be expected to be
   complimentary in their predictions. In order to optimize prediction, we
   used a voting procedure in which predictions were accepted only when
   predicted by both types of networks.
