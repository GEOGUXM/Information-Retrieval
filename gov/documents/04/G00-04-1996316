   This website is split in two sections, one for each beamline. Please
   select one:

   [forward.gif] [h_space.gif] 8-ID: The insertion device beamline is
   dedicated to condensed matter physics and the study of non-equilibrium
   phenomena through time-resolved X-ray scattering.

   [forward.gif] [h_space.gif] 8-BM: The bending magnet beamline is a
   biology beamline dedicated to macromolecular X-ray diffraction.
