       The Southwest Fisheries Science Center is the research arm of the
   National Marine Fisheries Service Southwest Region. The Center consists
   of four laboratories--three are located in California at La Jolla
   (headquarters), Pacific Grove, and Santa Cruz, and one is located in
   Honolulu, Hawaii.

       The Center conducts marine biological, economic, and oceanographic
   research at these laboratories. Center scientists gather and analyze
   data on living marine resources and their environment throughout the
   Pacific and in the Antarctic. The ultimate purpose of the data
   collection and analysis is for protection and management of these
   resources, to ensure that fish, marine mammal, and sea turtle
   populations remain at sustainable and healthy levels and that the most
   effective fishing regulations and international fisheries treaties are
   implemented.
