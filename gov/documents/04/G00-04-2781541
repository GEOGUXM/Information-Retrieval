What is the 1-800-RECYCLE database?

   The Washington State Department of Ecology maintains a database of
   recycling opportunities available in Washington State.
     * History

     Since 1976, information from this database has been available by
     calling 1-800-RECYCLE, the states toll-free recycling hotline.

     * Contents

     The database contains information provided by the organizations that
     operate recycling sites and services in Washington State.

     * Updates

     Every six months to a year, Ecology staff contact those
     organizations to update their information.

     * Limitations

     The services provided at last report are subject to change (due to
     fluctuating markets, political developments, or other causes). We
     therefore advise you to call a firm or agency directly before
     transporting anything to a location.
     __________________________________________________________________

How can you use the database?

     * By telephone

     You can still dial 1-800-RECYCLE and talk to a real person, between
     9 a.m. and 4 p.m. (closed for lunch, noon to 1p.m.) Monday through
     Friday (except holidays).

     * On-line

     You can search Ecologys recycling database directly on the Internet
     and use it to locate sites or services that recycle or safely
     dispose of household wastes.

On-line Results

     You will find more details about particular services as you search
     out sites in the database. If you still need more details, phone
     numbers will be found in the listings. And youre always welcome to
     call 1-800-RECYCLE during business hours.

Who should use the database?

     * Household recycling

     The database presented here lists services available to private
     households. In many cases, these services would not be available to
     businesses.

     * Residence requirements

     In cases where a service is funded by a local government agency, use
     of the service might be limited to only those households located
     within that particular county or city. This is particularly true of
     the household hazardous waste (HHW) sites listed in the database.
     Not only will they turn business waste away, but in almost all cases
     they will also turn away residents of other counties.

Disclaimer

     Ecology does not endorse any of the companies or guarantee the
     quality of the service provided. This database is not necessarily
     complete, and there may be other companies qualified to offer these
     services in addition to those listed.
