        The Washington State Gambling Commission is a public service agency
        operated under the executive branch of state government. The commission
        was created by the 1973 legislature as a law enforcement agency tasked
        with the responsibility of regulating social gambling activities
        authorized by the legislature and controlling unauthorized gambling
        activities. In 1992, the legislature added the responsibility to
        negotiate tribal/state compacts for casino gambling activities and to
        implement the terms of such agreements reached with tribes.

     Our Mission

        Protect the public by ensuring that gambling is legal and honest.
