   The Office of Global Programs (OGP) leads the NOAA Climate and Global
   Change (C&GC) Program. OGP assists NOAA by sponsoring focused
   scientific research aimed at understanding climate variability and its
   predictability. Through studies in these areas, researchers coordinate
   activities that jointly contribute to improved predictions and
   assessments of climate variability over a continuum of timescales from
   season to season, year to year, and over the course of a decade and
   beyond.
