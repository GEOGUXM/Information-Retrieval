   MiniBooNE Detector To test for neutrino mass via a search for neutrino
   oscillations. Neutrino mass is important because it may lead us to
   physics beyond the standard model. Masses in the range accessible to
   MiniBooNE will expand our understanding of how the universe has
   evolved.
   The MiniBooNE project began in 1997. Construction of the MiniBooNE
   project is on track, and we expect to begin collecting neutrino event
   data in 2002.
