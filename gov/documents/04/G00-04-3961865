   National Resources Inventory


   The Natural Resources Conservation Service works with West Virginia's
   14 Soil Conservation Districts, West Virginia Soil Conservation Agency,
   6 WV Resource Conservation and Development Councils, and other federal,
   state, and local agencies to help farmers and landowners conserve,
   improve, and sustain natural resources on West Virginia's 15.5 million
   acres of land.

   Nearly one fourth of the state is farmland which contributes more than
   $323.5 million to West Virginia's economy each year.

   Conservation practices benefit everyone as they help to improve water
   quality, decrease soil erosion, and assist West Virginia's farmers in
   continuing their long tradition of good land stewardship and a
   productive and environmentally friendly industry.
