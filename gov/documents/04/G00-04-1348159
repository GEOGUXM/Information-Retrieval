Service Life Prediction of Polymer Coatings

   Description:  NIST is conducting basic and applied research to
   investigate degradation mechanisms, improve characterization methods,
   and develop mathematical models of polymer coating degradation due to
   exposure to outdoor environments. Stochastic models, which are based in
   reliability theory and life-testing analysis, are included in the
   modeling efforts.

Service Life Prediction of Sealant Materials

   Description:  Researchers at NIST are investigating degradation
   mechanisms, improving characterization methods, and developing
   mathematical models of the degradation of sealant used in a variety of
   applications. Similar methodology to the polymer coatings research is
   being employed.

Polymer Interphases Consortium

   Description:  Researchers from three NIST laboratories are
   investigating the development of interphase regions and their effects
   on the performance of polymeric systems. Advanced characterization
   methods and models are being developed in three interrelated areas:
   Near-Field Scanning Optical Microscopy
    1. Characterization of Polymer Surfaces
          + Scratch and Mar Resistance
    2. Effects of Shear Flow and Thermal Gradients
    3. Interphase Characterization

Measurement Science for Optical Reflectance and Scattering

   Description: Collaborative research between four NIST laboratories is
   aimed at advancing the science of measuring optical reflectance
   properties and characterizing appearance properties of materials.
   Measurement techniques and mathematical models for quantifying light
   scattering from a material are being developed and used as input for
   computer rendering models and procedures for determining appearance
   characteristics. The research developments will be applicable in
   ecommerce and in the design, manufacture and sale of materials.
