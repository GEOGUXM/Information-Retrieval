                                 Welcome to

                U.S. District Court California Northern PACER

   Electronic Filing began at California Northern on 4/2/2001. With it
   came a new database. All civil cases filed on or after 4/2 can be found
   only in the new system, at ecf.cand.uscourts.gov. Your PACER login will
   allow you access to the new system. Use the "Live E-Filing Login" link,
   and choose "Reports" from the blue toolbar on the welcome page to run a
   docket sheet. (Case number cutoffs: cases with numbers greater than
   01cv1296 for SF and Oakland venue cases, or greater than 01cv20269 for
   San Jose venue cases, are only to be found in the new system.)

   UPDATES: Dockets on the system are updated every night; the info you
   find should be current as of the previous business day. Updates are
   usually posted to this system by 1 AM Pacific time.

   CONTENT: This system contains all Civil cases filed between 8/90 and
   3/31/01, and all Criminal cases filed since 8/91. Some but not all
   earlier filed cases which were pending on those dates can also be
   found. Miscellaneous case dockets are also available.
