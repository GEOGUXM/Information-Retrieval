   Education Programs
   Providing strategic leadership in educational and laboratory-directed
   research activities


   The primary objective of the INEEL's Education and Research Initiative
   (ERI) program is to provide strategic leadership in educational and
   laboratory-directed research activities. INEEL educational programs
   work with students over the entire education continuum to ensure a
   future workforce that will continue the long-term mission of the INEEL.

   INEEL has a long history of supporting pre-college and college-level
   internships and fellowships. The Inland Northwest Research Alliance
   (INRA), consisting of seven universities, is a partner in the
   management team of Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC, the management and
   operating contractor for the INEEL. We expect that these partnerships
   will lead to joint INRA-INEEL research initiatives for university
   faculty and students.

   INEEL's education encompasses Pre-college (K-12) and university-level.
   You will find more information about these programs below and elsewhere
   on this Web site.

   Pre-college
   The K-12 Education Program reflects the science, engineering, and
   technology mission areas of the INEEL. It is an investment in the next
   generation workforce such that a talent pool for science and
   engineering is increased. Programs the INEEL supports are:
     * JASON Idaho
     * Teaming Teachers with INEEL (TTI)
     * Student Action Teams (SAT)
     * Math and Science Equipment Gift Program
     * Science Exposition
     * Scholastic Tournament
     * Adopt-a-School is supported as a part of DOE's Adopt-a-School
       program

   University Programs
   University Programs, in partnership with regional and national colleges
   and universities, and in collaboration with the Inland Northwest
   Research Alliance, supports the mission of the INEEL.

   Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC, the management and operating contractor for
   the INEEL, provides higher education opportunities for employees
   through the INEEL employee education programs, as well as offering
   various scholarship programs and the Bechtel Foundation Matching Gifts
   Program.

   Opportunities for non-employees include:
     * Practicum
     * Undergraduate Fellowship
     * Computer Science Power Fellowship Program
     * Graduate Fellowship
     * Postgraduate Internship
     * Faculty research and sabbatical fellowships

   By linking colleges, universities, DOE laboratory facilities, and INEEL
   scientists and engineers (mentors) in research and applied learning
   activities, University Programs helps meet the DOE and INEEL goals of
   fostering science and engineering literacy and developing a future
   qualified workforce.

   University Programs also coordinates with and directs the Mid-West
   Regional Resource Center for Innovations, which promotes regional
   technical outreach and provides commercialization assistance to
   inventors and innovators.
