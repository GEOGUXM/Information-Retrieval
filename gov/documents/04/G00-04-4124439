                                   Mission

   The mission of the Independent Oversight (IO) Office is to
   independently analyze and verify the effectiveness of BNL systems and
   processes and to report these results to Laboratory management.  IO

     * Verifies the effectiveness, efficiency and adequacy of
       Self-Assessment Programs of each Directorate;
     * Evaluates and determines the significance of events that are not in
       compliance with the Price-Anderson Amendments Act (PAAA) in
       conjunction with the PAAA Working Group;
     * Conducts Special Studies/Investigations of Laboratory systems and
       processes as requested by line managers;
     * Captures and selectively distributes Lessons Learned from BNL and
       DOE work experiences that have applicability to a larger audience;
     * Coordinates external assessments of Laboratory-wide ESH&Q programs;
     * Manages the BNL Assessment Tracking System (ATS);
     * Manages the BNL Occurrence Reporting (ORPS) Program; and
     * Manages the BNL Tracking/Trending/Analysis (TT&A) Database.
