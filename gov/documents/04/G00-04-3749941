   The Space Environment Center (SEC) provides the downlink, and initial
   processing of all SXI imagery. Their site provides a variety of
   information, including operational status reports, a scientific user's
   guide, and a mission overview.

                           SXI STATUS (2001-12-20)

   GOES 12 and SXI have successfully completed Post-Launch Testing (PLT).
     The spacecraft has been placed in a storage mode as of December 20,
   2001 as a backup to the currently operational GOES spacecraft. GOES 12
   and SXI will become operational when needed as a replacement for either
    GOES 8 or GOES 10. No new SXI data will be available until that time.

      However, there are plans to release FITS format data from the PLT
    period by the summer of 2002, when additional instrument performance
                     analysis will have been completed.

   Real-time access to GOES SXI data is accomplished through a cooperative
   effort between NOAA's Space Environment Center (SEC) and National
   Geophysical Data Center (NGDC). SEC collects the data from GOES-12,
   provides initial processing, and integrates the observation into their
   real-time space weather alert and forecast services. The data are
   instantaneously transmitted to NGDC where they are archived and made
   available via this web interface.
