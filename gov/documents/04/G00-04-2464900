   The acquisition by the People's Republic of China of advanced military
   or dual-use technologies from the United States by trade (including

   transfers, if any, that contribute to the proliferation of weapons of
   mass destruction or their delivery systems, or that undermine
   international agreements or United States laws with respect to

   Any transfers, other than those identified under subparagraph (B), to
   the military systems of the People's Republic of China made by United
   States firms and United States-based multinational corporations;
