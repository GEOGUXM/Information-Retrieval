   By a 6-3 vote, the United States Supreme Court today ruled in EEOC v.
   Waffle House, Inc. (No. 99-1823) that a private arbitration agreement
   between an individual and that individual's employer does not prevent
   the EEOC from filing a court action in its own name and recovering
   monetary damages for the individual. The Supreme Court reversed a lower
   court decision that had prevented the EEOC from recovering monetary
   damages on behalf of an individual who had previously agreed with his
   employer to arbitrate the individual's private claim of discrimination.
