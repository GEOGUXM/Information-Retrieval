                  NTIS-GPO Imaging Pilot Project: Phase One


   The National Technical Information Service (NTIS) and the Government
   Printing Office (GPO) would like to welcome you to the NTIS-GPO Imaging
   Pilot Project: Phase One. Agency planners have been working long and
   hard on this project. We are pleased to announce that we are ready for
   the first phase of implementation.

   BACKGROUND: The American Technology Preeminence Act established
   procedures for Federal agencies to transfer unclassified information
   resulting from federally-funded research and development activities to
   the National Technical Information Service. In the regulations
   implementing the act, NTIS proposed giving the Depository Library
   community free access to the agency's document image files as soon as
   it was technically feasible. As technology progressed, many people at
   NTIS and the Government Printing Office worked to orchestrate the
   administrative support the project needed. NTIS and GPO wanted the
   pilot project to be operated under the sponsorship of the Federal
   Depository Library Program. In December 1997, an interagency agreement
   between NTIS and GPO laid the groundwork for conducting a pilot project
   with 20 libraries. NTIS is realizing the design of a fully automated
   document search, order, and delivery system for use in the pilot
   project. The system will be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
