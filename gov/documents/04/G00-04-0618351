   Overview of the 2002-03 Governor's Budget (January 15, 2002)
   The 2002-03 Governor's Budget offers a plan for addressing the state's
   $12-plus billion budgetary shortfall. While "on paper" the plan appears
   to work, many of its assumptions are overly optimistic, it relies
   largely on one-time solutions, and it results in substantial long- term
   out-year costs. Moreover, the plan does not resolve the state's
   budgetary imbalance in subsequent years.

   Review of the Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) (December 5,
   2001)
   A member requested comprehensive review of the Department of Managed
   Health Cares (DMHC) $30 million budget and its daily operations. We
   offer a series of options for further reform of the managed care
   industry, including licensing and certification of medical groups and
   expanded state review of HMO contracts for medical services.

   Addressing the State's Fiscal Problem (December 19, 2001)
   Due to weak economic and revenue performance, California faces a $12.4
   billion budget shortfall in 2002-03. We identify several key
   budget-balancing principles and strategies and identify specific
   spending and revenue options for implementing these strategies.
   Finally, we review the administration's initial proposals to address
   the current-year shortfall and offer additional current-year options
   for the Legislature to consider.
