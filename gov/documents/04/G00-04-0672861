                   Coordinated Data Analysis Web (CDAWeb)
     __________________________________________________________________

   The CDAWeb data service directly supports graphics, digital listings
   and simultaneous multi-mission, multi-instrument selection and
   comparison of science data among a wide range of current space
   missions, including ACE, Cluster, Equator-S, FAST, Geotail, IMAGE,
   IMP-8, ISTP (Polar and Wind), Interball (Tail and Aurora), SAMPEX, SOHO
   and Ulysses. CDAWeb also supports data from geosynchronous satellites
   including GOES 6/7/8/9/10 and LANL 1989/1990/1991/1994/1997; from
   ground-based facilities including CANOPUS, DARN, the Finnish
   Meteorological Institute and SESAME; from older space missions
   including Dynamics Explorer (DE-1, DE-2), Hawkeye, and ISIS; and for
   key data dedicated to use by specific science teams, including the
   Cluster Prime Parameters.
