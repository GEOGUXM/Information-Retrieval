   Happy Holidays

   As Congress adjourns, I would like to take this opportunity to wish
   each and every one of you a very happy holiday season. This has been a
   year unlike any other, with situations that have challenged all of us.
   This holiday season, lets especially take time to enjoy the little
   things in life: the look on a childs face on Christmas morning, the
   special holiday dinners with friends and family gathered together, and
   the celebrations that take us into a New Year.

   Congress will resume session in January and Ill work hard on the
   issues important to you. Well pass a new Farm Bill that will provide a
   true safety net to our farmers and ranchers, and Ill keep working to
   boost our economy and bring more good paying jobs to our state. Please
   keep in touch with my office as we move into 2002 and let me know your
   concerns and suggestions.

   Enjoy your holidays, keep close to your loved ones, and have a very
   Happy New Year!

   Max
