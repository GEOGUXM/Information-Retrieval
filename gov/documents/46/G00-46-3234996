   California Cooperative Occupational Information System (CCOIS)
          The California Cooperative Occupational Information System
          (CCOIS) is a partnership of state and local agencies that
          produces local occupational and labor market information. It is
          a statewide program that is operational at 35 sites that
          represent 58 counties throughout California. The local agencies,
          referred to as Local Partners, consist of Workforce Development
          Boards, local Workforce Investment Boards and other workforce
          investment agencies, and Economic Development Agencies.

   California Community College Occupational Education Programs
          Under a contract with the California Community Colleges
          Chancellor's Office, the Labor Market Information Division of
          the EDD tabulates its projections of employment by occupation
          into the TOP code structure.  These tabulations are available as
          Excel spreadsheets at
          http://www.calmis.ca.gov/htmlfile/programs/coccc/Intro.htm

   LMI Advisory Group
          The Labor Market Information Division (LMID) established the LMI
          Advisory Group as a way to get policy level direction on unmet
          customer information needs and on changes to existing products
          and services. Members represent the State, local and Federal
          government entities; the workforce preparation community;
          economic development agencies; economists; and researchers; as
          well as the employer and job seeker communities.  The agendas
          and minutes of the quarterly meetings are on-line.

   Prevailing Wage Program for H-1B and Permanent Visas
          One aspect of granting a visa under the 1990 Immigration Act for
          skilled and professional foreign workers requires determining if
          the wage the employer intends to pay the alien meets the
          "prevailing wage" for that occupation in the geographic area in
          which the alien will be employed.  The prevailing wage
          determinations are completed by the Wage Research Unit of the
          Labor Market Information Division, Employment Development
          Department.  Information and forms to file for such a
          determination are available on-line.

   Workforce Investment Act of 1998
          The Workforce Investment Act rewrites federal laws governing
          workforce preparation programs including job training, adult
          education and literacy, and vocational rehabilitation, replacing
          them with streamlined and more flexible systems.  As one of the
          lead agencies for the Welfare to Work and the Workforce
          Investment Act in California, there are many resources and
          contacts available.  Go to the Workforce Investment Community.
          Additional information is also available on the Workforce
          Investment Act.
