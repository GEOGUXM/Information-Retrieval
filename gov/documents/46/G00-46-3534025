     __________________________________________________________________

   The Secretary of State assigns an Assembly or Senate bill (bill) a
   number known as the chapter number; when the Governor approves, signs,
   dates, and deposits the bill with the Secretary of State. This copy is
   the official record and law of the State.
   The bills are numbered consecutively in the order in which they are
   received, and the resulting sequence is presumed to be the order in
   which the Governor approved the bills. (Government Code 9510)
   When the Governor vetoes a bill, he or she returns it to the House of
   orgin, with his or her objections.
   A statute enacted at a regular session usually goes into effect on
   January 1 next following a 90-day period from the date of enactment of
   the statute and a statute enacted at a special session shall go into
   effect on the 91st day after adjournment of the special session at
   which the bill was passed. Statutes calling for elections, providing
   for tax levies or appropriations for the usual current expenses of the
   state, and urgency measures go into effect immediately upon their
   enactment. Every concurrent and joint resolution takes effect upon
   filing with the Secretary of State. (Government Code 9600)
   We have provided you with an opportunity to view specific Bill Letters.
   California's legislative session is two years e.g., 1997-1998,
   1999-2000. Bill Letters are published monthly (January through May),
   weekly (June through August), or daily (September through October) per
   calendar year.
   TERMS DEFINED

   ACTION CODES - Bills that note one of the following codes, usually,
   take effect immediately.
     * T = TAX LEVY - Any bill that imposes, repeals, or materially alters
       a state tax. Legislative Counsel determines whether a bill is a tax
       levy.
     * U = URGENCY - A clause adopted by the House by a two-thirds vote of
       the elected members
     * A = APPROPRIATION
     * E = ELECTION

   BILL - A draft of a proposed law introduced by a member of the
   Legislature. (Assembly Bill 4000 = AB 4000 or Senate Bill 10 = SB 10)
   CHAPTER - After a bill has been signed by the Governor, the Secretary
   of State assigns the bill a "Chapter Number" such as "Chapter 123,
   Statutes of 1992," which is subsequently used to refer to the measure
   rather than the bill number.
   CONCURRENT RESOLUTION - A measure that can be introduced in either
   house, but must be approved by both houses and filed with the Secretary
   of State to take effect. These measures usually involve the business of
   the Legislature. (e.g., adoption of the Joint Rules.)
   HOUSE RESOLUTION - A document that is the expression of one house.
   House resolutions are generally used to amend house rules or to create
   committees.
   JOINT RESOLUTION - Expresses an opinion about an issue pertaining to
   the federal government; forwarded to Congress for its information.
   Joint resolutions require the approval of both the Assembly and Senate
   but does not require the signature of the Governor to take effect.
   VETO - The formal action when the Governor disapproves a bill. A
   two-thirds vote of each house is necessary to override the veto and
   make the bill become law.
