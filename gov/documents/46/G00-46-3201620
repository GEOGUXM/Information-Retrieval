               S/MORE - Shuttle-MIR Online Research Experience

   S/MORE is a K-12 project providing a behind-the-scenes look at the life
   sciences research conducted in space aboard the Mir station. S/MORE
   focuses on the men and women doing and supporting this research. The
   goal is to encourage students' interest in science and technology
   careers by portraying the NASA experts as friendly people through
   biographies and field journals of day-to-day activities. While the
   project was active (Fall 1996), students were encouraged to interact
   with these enthusiastic folks as a way to further engage them in the
   process of cutting-edge research. In addition, a special activity
   highlights the cross-cultural nature of this US/Russian effort.
   Although S/MORE is no longer interactive (ie no more chats or email
   responses), the archive will remain available indefinitely and remains
   educationally useful.

   The S/MORE Web pages include:
     * Project News: recent updates
     * Featured Events: project segments to stimulate students
     * The Shuttle-Mir Team:
          + Biographical sketches of the men and women of the project will
            help students relate to the project at a human level.
          + Journal reports from Mir personnel describe their day-to-day
            activities and their particular role in the project. These
            reports will help students understand the diversity of people
            and skills that are needed for success in a modern science
            project.
     * Background information:
          + Mir space station
          + Microgravity
          + Science
          + Related Web pages
     * Photo Gallery: interesting and relevant images
     * Teacher's Resource Center:
          + A place for discussion among teachers (available through email
            or Web)
          + Classroom activities
     * Student Activities:
          + Projects for kids
          + Gallery of student work
          + Gallery of participating classrooms
     * Cultural Activities provide the opportunity for cross-cultural
       interaction to build better understanding between classrooms of
       diverse backgrounds.
     * Questions provide an ability for students to ask questions of
       project participants via email.
