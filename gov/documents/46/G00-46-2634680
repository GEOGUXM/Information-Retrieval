     Estrogen Doesn't Prevent Second Strokes: Protective Effects of Hormone

Overview

   Estrogen hormone replacement therapy does not reduce the risk of stroke
   or death in postmenopausal women who have already had a stroke or a
   transient ischemic attack (TIA), according to a report from the first
   randomized, controlled clinical trial of estrogen therapy for secondary
   prevention of cerebrovascular disease.

   Estrogen hormone replacement therapy does not reduce the risk of stroke
   or death in postmenopausal women who have already had a stroke or a
   transient ischemic attack (TIA), according to a report from the first
   randomized, controlled clinical trial of estrogen therapy for secondary
   prevention of cerebrovascular disease.

   Previous observational studies have suggested that estrogen replacement
   therapy may reduce the risk of stroke and death in postmenopausal
   women. However, it was not clear whether the apparent benefits of
   estrogen among women in those studies were due to the hormone therapy
   or other factors. The new randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
   study, called the Women's Estrogen for Stroke Trial (WEST), was
   designed to resolve this question. The study, led by Ralph I. Horwitz,
   M.D., of the Yale University School of Medicine, was funded by the
   National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and
   will be published in the October 25, 2001, issue of The New England
   Journal of Medicine.*

   "The good news is that we have taken a lot of guesswork out of treating
   women with strokes. The benefits from estrogen that we hoped for are
   not there to balance the risks," says John R. Marler, M.D., NINDS
   Associate Director for Clinical Trials.

   Based on this finding, the investigators say, estrogen therapy should
   not be prescribed for the purpose of preventing a second stroke or
   death in postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women who are already
   taking estrogen or who wish to take it for other reasons should seek
   the advice of their personal physicians to decide whether to continue
   or start therapy. Estrogen has rarely been prescribed specifically for
   stroke prevention, says Lawrence M. Brass, M.D., of the Yale University
   School of Medicine, principal neurologist on the study. However, it has
   been widely prescribed for prevention of osteoporosis (thinning of the
   bones) and relief of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes.

   The researchers enrolled 664 postmenopausal women with an average age
   of 71 years who had experienced an ischemic stroke or a TIA within the
   previous 90 days. Ischemic strokes and TIAs result from blockages in
   the vessels that supply blood to the brain. Participants were given a
   number of initial assessments, including the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS)
   of neurological impairment and the Barthel index of functional ability
   in activities of daily living. In addition to the usual best care for
   patients who have had a stroke, women in the trial received either oral
   estrogen (estradiol 17-beta at the standard replacement dose of 1 mg
   daily) or a matching placebo. Patients were studied for an average of
   2.8 years. They stopped receiving the estrogen or placebo if they had a
   stroke.

   The researchers found that there was no significant difference in the
   incidence of stroke or death in the women who were randomly assigned to
   receive estrogen instead of placebo. However, they found that the
   incidence of death due to stroke was higher in the estrogen group and
   that the non-fatal strokes in that group were associated with slightly
   worse neurological and functional impairments at 1 month after stroke.
   Tthe risk of stroke within the first 6 months after enrollment in the
   study was also higher among women in the estrogen group. There were no
   significant differences between treatment groups in the number of TIAs
   or non-fatal heart attacks. However, participants receiving estrogen
   were more likely to experience gynecologic complications, particularly
   vaginal bleeding.

   While this is the first controlled clinical trial to evaluate estrogen
   for stroke prevention, the results are similar to findings from the
   Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS), the first
   placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of hormone replacement
   therapy for prevention of heart disease in postmenopausal women who had
   pre-existing heart disease. The HERS results, published in 1998, showed
   that treating these women with a combination of estrogen and progestin
   did not reduce heart attacks or death from heart disease. That study
   also found no reduction in strokes among women who received the study
   drug. Additional information about the benefits and risks of hormone
   replacement therapy is expected from the Women's Health Initiative
   (WHI), a long-term prospective study of more than 27,000 healthy
   postmenopausal women that is examining whether estrogen or an
   estrogen/progestin combination can help prevent heart disease. Results
   from the first 2 years of the WHI study suggest a small increase in the
   number of heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots in women receiving
   the hormone therapy.

   While the WEST study provides important information about the use of
   estrogen in women with existing cerebrovascular disease, many questions
   remain to be answered, according to the investigators. They are
   planning additional analyses of their data to look at the effects of
   estrogen on cognition and physical function. The study results also may
   change researchers' understanding of how estrogen affects blood vessels
   and lead to new research in that area, says Dr. Horwitz.

   The NINDS is a component of the National Institutes of Health in
   Bethesda, Maryland, and is the nation's primary supporter of biomedical
   research on the brain and nervous system. The Institute is celebrating
   its 50th anniversary this year.
