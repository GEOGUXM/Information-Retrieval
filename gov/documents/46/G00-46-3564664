   Ambiguity in the UMLS® Metathesaurus® 2000 Edition Alan R. Aronson
   February 24, 2000 1. Introduction The number of explicitly ambiguous
   Metathesaurus terms in the 2000 edition has grown some- what over the
   1999 edition. Table 1 shows several counts that indicate that growth in
   broad terms. % 1999 2000 change Strings with an ambiguity designator
   7,912 9,416 +19% Concepts with one or more ambiguity 6,565 7,409 +13%
   Cases of ambiguity 3,669 4,361 +19% Table 1. Measures of ambiguity in
   the UMLS Metathesaurus Some examples will clarify the meaning of the
   counts. There are 54 Metathesaurus strings `Other ' for n ranging from
   1 to 54; these strings occur in 54 distinct concepts but represent a
   single case of ambiguity. Some concepts contain more than one ambiguous
   string. In fact, the concept `Optic Nerve Glioma, Childhood' has 37
   ambiguous strings. A more manageable example of a concept with multiple
   ambiguities is `Arthrogryposis' which has the following six ambiguous
   strings: Amyoplasia congenita <1> Congenital Arthromyodysplasia <1>
   Congenital multiple arthrogryposis <1> myodystrophia fetalis deformans
   <2> myodystrophia foetalis deformans <2> pterygium universale <2> All
   but the last string are ambiguous with strings belonging to the concept
   `Amyoplasia congenita disruptive sequence'. The concept containing
   `pterygium universale <1>', however, is `Multiple pterygium syndrome'.
   1 2. Review of the Problem The information in Table 1 shows that the
   amount of ambiguity in the Metathesaurus increased almost 20% from 1999
   to 2000 and that several concepts involved in the new ambiguities have
   more than one ambiguity. Examining the cases of ambiguity more closely,
   consider the degree of ambiguity, i.e., the number of ways a string is
   ambiguous. `Other ', for example, has degree 54. Table 2 contains the
   distribution of ambiguities in the Metathesaurus according to degree.
   Degree of 1999 2000 % ambiguity cases cases change 54 1 1 - 23 1 1 - 18
   1 1 - 16 2 2 - 8 3 3 - 7 2 2 - 6 1 2 +100% 5 9 9 - 4 52 71 +37% 3 321

   2. Metathesaurus ambiguity distribution by degree Note that an
   ambiguity of degree one is not actually an ambiguity. `Abbreviations
   <1>', for exam- ple, is not ambiguous since there are no other
   `Abbreviations ' strings in the Metathesaurus. The most important thing
   to note about the table is that changes in ambiguity are focused on
   ambiguities of degree four or less and mainly of degree two. At least
   for 2000 there is no prolifer- ation of the problematic ambiguity of
   high degree. The purpose of this study is to examine the growth in
   ambiguity to be able to characterize its effect on text processing
   applications. Section 2 reviews the highly ambiguous cases discovered
   in the 1999 edition of this report. Section 3 examines the effect of
   removing suppressible synonyms from the study. Section 4 focuses on the
   cases of ambiguity of lesser degree. And Section 5 con- tains a summary
   of the results and recommendations for handling ambiguity in the Meta-
   thesaurus. 2. Review of the Problem The UMLS Metathesaurus denotes
   explicit ambiguity by appending an ambiguity designator, a number in
   angle brackets, to the end of an ambiguous string. Because strings with
   ambiguity des- ignators require significant special processing, the
   original string (with possible case changes) is always included as
   another string for the concept involved. Thus each concept with a
   string `aaa Ambiguity in the UMLS Metathesaurus (2000 Edition) 2 2.
   Review of the Problem ' also has string `aaa' (ignoring case
   differences). But now any application which gains access to the
   Metathesaurus textually, cannot tell the difference among the concepts
   of an ambiguous cluster `aaa ' each of which is represented by `aaa'.
   English Metathesaurus strings with the largest degree of ambiguity are
   listed below in decreasing order. Bold text indicates the difference
   between the 1999 and 2000 Metathesaurus. The differ- ences for
   ambiguities of degree 5 or more are that `Cold ' and `Stomach ' each
   got an additional ambiguity. They are described in detail below. * 54

   UMLS Metathesaurus (2000 Edition) 3 3. Removing Suppressible Synonyms
   2.1 `Cold ' The concepts associated with the six senses of `Cold' are *
   `cold temperature' * `Common Cold' * `Cold Therapy' * `Chronic
   Obstructive Airway Disease' (which has strings `COLD' and `Chronic
   Obstructive Lung Disease' * `Cold Sensation' * `Cold brand of
   chlorpheniramine-phenylpropanolamine' The new sense is shown in bold
   and comes from the Multum MediSource Lexicon (MMSL99). In 1999 I argued
   that all five senses of cold were legitimate. COLD was considered a
   valid sense because the Metathesaurus does not yet distinguish case.
   Research on word sense disambiguation has made me rethink my position.
   I now believe that `cold temperature', `Common Cold' and `Cold
   Sensation' are legitimate senses of cold. `Cold Therapy' is not a
   legitimate sense of cold. The word cold does not convey enough of the
   meaning of `Cold Therapy'. Equivalently, it is diffi- cult to construct
   a reasonable sentence containing the word cold without the word therapy
   but with the `Cold Therapy' sense. COLD is also not legitimate and can
   be treated properly by any system which recognizes case differences.
   Finally, the new sense, `Cold brand of chlorphe-
   niramine-phenylpropanolamine' is not a legitimate sense for the same
   reason that `Cold Therapy' is not. 2.2 `Stomach ' The concepts
   associated with the five senses of `Stomach' are * `Stomach' * `Benign
   neoplasm of stomach' * `Carcinoma in situ of stomach' * `Neoplasm of
   uncertain or unknown behavior of stomach' * `Stomach problem' Only the
   first concept, `Stomach' is a legitimate sense of the word stomach.
   Appropriately, the `Stomach ' and `Stomach' strings associated with the
   remaining concepts are marked as sup- pressible synonyms. 3. Removing
   Suppressible Synonyms Each Metathesaurus string is assigned a term
   status: P for preferred terms, S for synonyms, and s for suppressible
   synonyms. Suppressible synonyms are shortened forms of other terms (see
   sec- tions 2.1 and 2.2 above for examples) and are best ignored for
   text processing of the Meta- thesaurus. The 2000 edition of the
   Metathesaurus has 1,018 suppressible synonyms, 9% more than the 932
   such strings in the 1999 edition. Removing suppressible synonyms from
   the Meta- Ambiguity in the UMLS Metathesaurus (2000 Edition) 4 3.
   Removing Suppressible Synonyms thesaurus produces the ambiguity
   distribution shown in Table 3. There are now 4,139 cases of Cases Cases

   represent a significant reduction in the high ambiguity cases. The list

   differences from the previous list are shown in bold. * 5 `Other '

   4 `ET - Esotropia ' * 4 `HRF ' * 4 `U ' * 4 `lupus ' * 4 `ms ' * ...
   The five remaining senses of `Other ' are * `Other' (<1>) * `Other
   location of complaint' (<2>) * `Other activities involving preparation
   of a routine non-injectable drug product' (<52>) * `Other activities
   involving preparation of compounded non-parenteral medications' (<53>)
   * `Other activities involving preparation of compounded parenteral
   medications' (<54>) All but the first sense need to be suppressed. The
   two remaining senses of `Injuries ' are * `Physical trauma' (<1>) *
   `Injury inflicted to the body by an external force' (<2>) Although the
   senses which were clearly wrong have been removed, the remaining senses
   seem to be synonymous (and the first sense is a MeSH subheading). The
   two remaining senses of `prostate ' are * `Prostate' (<1>) * `Prostatic
   Diseases' (<5>) The second sense needs to be suppressed since a
   prostatic disease is not a prostate just as a stom- ach problem is not
   a stomach. Similar analyses apply to `urethra ', `conjunctiva ' and
   `cornea ' each of which have an erroneous disease sense in addition to
   the correct body part sense. Finally, all of the senses of the
   following high degree cases also need to be suppressed * 23 `Protocols

   Ambiguity of Lesser Degree This section explores all 34 cases of
   ambiguity of degree 4 and 50 randomly selected cases of ambiguity of
   degree 3 or 2. (As Table 3 indicates, there are 303 cases of degree 3
   and 3,435 cases of degree 2.) 4.1 Ambiguity of degree 4 4.1.1 `AD ' *
   `Alzheimer's Disease' * `Dactinomycin' (which has string `Actinomycin
   D') * `Anterodorsal nucleus of thalamus' * `Admitting diagnosis' AD is
   an acronym in each case; suppress them. 4.1.2 `Aspiration ' *
   `Breathing' * `Endotracheal aspiration' * `Aspiration-action' *
   `Pulmonary aspiration' The two senses defined in Dorland seem to be
   represented by `Breathing' and `Aspiration-action'. The other two
   senses may be too specific and should probably be suppressed. 4.1.3
   `Blood Pressure ' * `Blood Pressure' (senses <1> and <3>; Organism
   Function) * `Blood pressure determination' (Diagnostic Procedure) *
   `Arterial pressure' (Laboratory or Test Result) It seems like there
   should only be two senses, the organism function (`Blood Pressure') and
   the diagnostic procedure/lab result (the other two concepts). This
   would argue for suppressing one of `Blood pressure determination' or
   `Arterial pressure', but it is not clear which one to choose. Ambiguity
   in the UMLS Metathesaurus (2000 Edition) 7 4. Ambiguity of Lesser
   Degree 4.1.4 `CAM ' * `Cell Adhesion Molecules' * `chorioallantoic
   membrane' * `CAM brand of Ephedrine Hydrochloride' * `Cam, topical
   lotion' The first two senses are acronyms and should be suppressed. The
   third sense should probably be suppressed as being too specific. And
   the fourth sense might be legitimate. 4.1.5 `Cl ' * `Chlorine' (`Cl
   <4>') * `Cycloleucine' (`CL <2>') * `centiliter' (`cL <1>') * `Chloride
   Ion' (`CL <3>') Although most of the senses can be distinguished
   because of case differences, I'm inclined to sup- press them all
   because they are acronyms/abbreviations. 4.1.6 `COPE ' *
   `cisplatin/cyclophosphamide/etoposide/vincristine' * `COPE <1>' (which
   has only one other string, `COPE') * `Cope brand of aspirin-caffeine' *
   `COPE <3>' (which also has only one other string, `COPE') `COPE <1>'
   and `COPE <3>' appear to have incomplete representations in the
   Metathesaurus, and the third sense is another brand. Thus everything
   except the first sense could be suppressed. 4.1.7 `CVP ' *
   `cyclophosphamide/prednisone/vincristine' * `Measurement of central
   venous pressure' * `cisplatin/cyclophosphamide/etoposide' * `Central
   Venous Pressure-Biological function' The third sense seems odd; but
   otherwise, they can all be suppressed as acronyms. 4.1.8 `Dandruff ' *
   `Seborrheic dermatitis of scalp' (Disease or Syndrome) * `Scurfiness of
   scalp' (Finding) * `Pityriasis simplex' (Disease or Syndrome) *
   `Dandruff brand of pyrithione zinc' (Phramacologic Substance) The brand
   name should be suppressed. Everything else seems reasonable. 4.1.9
   `Dressing ' * `Sterile coverings' (Medical Device) * `Clothing
   assistance' (Health Care Activity) * `Dressing of skin or wound'
   (Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure) * `Dressing self-care' (Finding)
   All senses seem to be legitimate. Ambiguity in the UMLS Metathesaurus
   (2000 Edition) 8 4. Ambiguity of Lesser Degree 4.1.10 `ET - Esotropia '
   * `Esotropia' * `Manifest alternating convergent squint' *
   `Intermittent convergent squint' * `Incomitant esotropia' All senses
   except the first seem to be findings associated with the first sense
   and could be sup- pressed. 4.1.11 `Evaluation ' * `Health evaluation'
   (<2>) * `Evaluation' (<1> and <3>) * `Pulmonary evaluation' (<4>) The
   third sense is too specific and should be suppressed. 4.1.12 `Fire ' *
   `Accident caused by unspecified fire' (Injury or Poisoning) * `Fire -
   disasters' (Phenomenon or Process) * `Fire - physical phenomenon'
   (Phenomenon or Process) * `Fire as a heat source' (Human-caused
   Phenomenon or Process) The first sense is a result of a fire, not a
   fire, itself; it should be suppressed. 4.1.13 `Grafts ' *
   `transplantation' (<2> and <3>; Functional Concept) * `Graft material'
   (<4>; Biomedical or Dental Material) * `Homologous Grafts' (<1>; Body
   Part, Organ, or Organ Component) The second sense is used in a graft
   but is not, itself, a graft. It should be suppressed. The third sense
   may or may not be too specific. See also `Graft ' which is three ways
   ambiguous involv- ing the same concepts. 4.1.14 `HRF ' * `Hypothalamic
   Releasing Factor' * `Gonadorelin' (which has string `FSH-Releasing
   Hormone') * `homologous restriction factor' * `HRF <3>' The fourth
   sense is not completely defined, but all of the senses can be
   suppressed as acronyms. 4.1.15 `Lupus ' * `Lupus Vulgaris' * `Lupus
   Erythematosus, Discoid' * `Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic' * `Lupus
   Erythematosus' As in the previous edition, the four senses seem to be
   legitimate although the second and third seem to be specific types of
   sense four and as such could be suppressed. Ambiguity in the UMLS
   Metathesaurus (2000 Edition) 9 4. Ambiguity of Lesser Degree 4.1.16
   `Mole ' * `Mole the mammal' * `Nevus, Pigmented' * `Benign melanocytic
   nevus of skin' * `Mole, unit of measurement' `Nevus, Pigmented' is a
   kind of `Benign melanocytic nevus of skin' and could be suppressed.
   4.1.17 `Morphology ' * `Morphology, NOS' (Finding) * `morphological'
   (Biomedical Occupation or Discipline) * `morphology <4>' (which has
   strings `physical form' and `physical shape'; Natural Phenome- non or
   Process) * `Science of Morphology' (Biomedical Occupation or
   Discipline) Based on the semantic types of the sense concepts, the
   second and fourth senses seem to be the same thing; one of them should
   be suppressed. In addition, the difference between the Finding and
   Natural Phenomenon or Process senses is small but probably legitimate.
   4.1.18 `Mosaic ' * `Mosaicism' (Organism Attribute) * `Embryonic
   Mosaic' (Cell or Molecular Dysfunction) * `Spatial Mosaic' (Spatial
   Concept) * `Mosaic - computer software' (Intellectual Product) All
   senses seem legitimate although the first two are closely related.
   4.1.19 `MS ' * `Mitral Valve Stenosis' (`ms <4>'!) * `Multiple
   Sclerosis' (`MS <3>') * `Morphine Sulfate' (`MS <2>') * `millisecond'
   (`ms <1>') The first three senses are acronyms and should be
   suppressed. The last sense, `millisecond', is an example of an
   ubiquitous acronym (or abbreviation), that is one which almost always
   appears in text without definition. Ubiquitous acronyms can be left
   unsuppressed, but they should also be explicitly accumulated into a
   list for text processing purposes. 4.1.20 `Nutrition ' * `Science of
   nutrition' (Biomedical Occupation or Discipline) * `Nutritional status'
   (Organism Attribute) * `Nutrition outcomes' (Intellectual Product) *
   `Feeding and dietary regimes' (Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure)
   Although senses two and three seem very close in meaning, all senses
   are probably reasonable. 4.1.21 `Orbital Prosthesis ' * `Ocular
   Prosthesis' (<1>) * `Orbital prosthesis implantation' (<2> and <4>) *
   `External orbital prosthesis' (<3>) Ambiguity in the UMLS Metathesaurus
   (2000 Edition) 10 4. Ambiguity of Lesser Degree The second and third
   senses should be suppressed; the second is a procedure involving an
   orbital prosthesis, and the third is too specific. 4.1.22 `P ' *
   `Phosphorus' * `Properdin' * `upper case pea' * `lower case pea' The
   first two cases are acronyms/abbreviations, and the last two are self
   referential. They should all be suppressed. 4.1.23 `Peripheral
   Neuroectodermal Tumor ' * `Neuroectodermal Tumor, Peripheral' *
   `Extraosseous Ewings sarcoma-primitive neuroepithelial tumor' * `Ewings
   sarcoma' * `Ewings sarcoma-primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET)' All
   senses but the first are more specific than the first and should be
   suppressed. 4.1.24 `PNET ' * `Neuroectodermal Tumor, Primitive' *
   `Extraosseous Ewings sarcoma-primitive neuroepithelial tumor' * `Ewings
   sarcoma' * `Ewings sarcoma-primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET)' This
   case is identical to the previous one; suppress all senses except the
   first. 4.1.25 `Pressure ' * `Pressure- physical agent' (Phenomenon or
   Process) * `Baresthesia' (Organ or Tissue Function) * `Pressure'
   (Functional Concept) * `Pressure - action' (Therapeutic or Preventive
   Procedure) All senses seem reasonable. 4.1.26 primitive neuroectodermal
   tumor * `Neuroectodermal Tumor, Primitive' * `Extraosseous Ewings
   sarcoma-primitive neuroepithelial tumor' * `Ewings sarcoma' * `Ewings
   sarcoma-primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET)' Except for replacing
   the word peripheral with primitive, this is exactly the same as example
   4.1.23. All senses except the first should be suppressed. 4.1.27
   `Relapse ' * `Relapse' * `Relapsing course' * `Relapse phase' * Cancer
   Relapse' All senses except for the first are too specific and should be
   suppressed. Ambiguity in the UMLS Metathesaurus (2000 Edition) 11 4.
   Ambiguity of Lesser Degree 4.1.28 `Screening ' * `Screening for cancer'
   (Health Care Activity) * `Screening procedure' (Diagnostic Procedure) *
   `Aspects of disease screening' (Intellectual Product) * `Screening for
   unspecified condition' (Finding) It may be that the fourth sense should
   have semantic type Diagnostic Procedure in which case it seems
   synonymous with sense two. Meanwhile, it could be suppressed. Senses
   one and three are too specific and should be suppressed. 4.1.29
   `Sensitivity ' * `Statistical sensitivity' (Quantitative Concept) *
   `Personality Sensitivity' (Mental Process) * `Antimicrobial
   susceptibility' (Laboratory or Test Result) * `Sensitivity <4>'
   (Finding) Each sense seems reasonable although `Sensitivity <4>' is not
   completely defined. (I was sur- prised to find that it is a child of
   `Social Interaction Skills' rather than having to do with being
   sensitive to touch.) Note, too, that psychological senses of words
   having other senses (such as `Personality Sensitivity') have often been
   suppressed. 4.1.30 `Sperm Count ' * `Sperm Count Procedure' (Laboratory
   Procedure) * `Sperm number' (Quantitative Concept) * `Encounter due to
   sperm count' (Finding) * `Sperm number observed' (Laboratory or Test
   Result) There are too many senses here. Perhaps the fourth sense, which
   seems to be part of sense one, could be suppressed. In addition, the
   third sense seems to be part of the more general notion of semen
   analysis and could also be suppressed. 4.1.31 `TEM ' *
   `Triethylenemelamine' * `Transmission Electron Microscopes' *
   `Transmissible mink encephalopathy' * `Transmission Electron
   Microscopy' All senses are acronyms/abbreviations and should be
   suppressed. Also, the third sense may be erroneous; it has no synonyms
   with the proper ordering of the acronym letters. 4.1.32 `Translocation
   ' * `Chromosomal translocation' (Genetic Function) * `Cellular
   translocation' (Cell Function) * `Intracellular translocation' (Cell
   Function) * `Protein translocation' (Cell Function) Senses two through
   four come only from CSP98 and seem redundant. Perhaps senses three and
   four could be suppressed. 4.1.33 `U ' * `Uranium' (<3> and <4>)
   Ambiguity in the UMLS Metathesaurus (2000 Edition) 12 4. Ambiguity of
   Lesser Degree * `Lower case you' (<1>) * `Unit' (<2>) All senses are
   abbreviatory or self referential and should be suppressed. 4.1.34 `XT -
   Exotropia ' * `Manifest divergent squint' * `Manifest alternating
   divergent squint' * `Intermittent divergent squint' * `Incomitant
   exotropia' All senses are findings of `Exotropia' which is not present
   in this case; they should all be sup- pressed. Note the similarity with
   example 4.1.10 except for the presence of the underlying con- cept. 4.2
   Ambiguity of degree 3 and 2 The first 4 cases below have ambiguity
   degree 3 and the remaining 46 have degree 2. 4.2.1 `Energy Conservation
   ' * `Physiological energy management' (Therapeutic or Preventive
   Procedure) * `Thermodynamic energy conservation' (Natural Phenomenon or
   Process) * `Energy Conservation <2>' (Finding) All senses seem
   appropriate. 4.2.2 `MAC ' * `Complement Membrane Attack Complex' *
   `MacAndrew Alcoholism Scale' * `Raincoat' All senses are abbreviatory
   and should be suppressed. 4.2.3 `PTC ' * `Factor IX' (which has string
   `Plasma Thromboplastin Component') * `Percutaneous transhepatic
   cholangiography' * `Oncogene, RET' (which has string `ret
   proto-oncogene (multiple endocrine neoplasia MEN2A, MEN2B and medullary
   thyroid carcinoma 1, Hirschsprung disease)) All senses seem to be
   abbreviatory and should be suppressed. 4.2.4 `Therapy ' * `Care
   involving unspecified rehabilitation procedure' (Finding) * `therapy
   <1>' (Functional Concept) * `Therapeutic procedure' (Therapeutic or
   Preventive Procedure) Sense one may be subsumed by sense three and
   could be suppressed. Sense two is a MeSH sub- heading. Its definition
   is Used with diseases for therapeutic interventions except drug
   therapy, diet therapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, for which specific
   subheadings exist. The concept is also used for articles and books
   dealing with multiple therapies. As with all subheadings, it may be
   best to suppress because of its specialized use. Ambiguity in the UMLS
   Metathesaurus (2000 Edition) 13 4. Ambiguity of Lesser Degree 4.2.5
   17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase * `3 (or 17)-beta-hydroxysteroid
   dehydrogenase' (<1> and <2>) There is really only one sense. 4.2.6 `22G
   ' * `22 gauge' * `22 grams' Both senses are abbreviatory and should be
   suppressed. 4.2.7 `alpha-L-iduronidase deficiency ' *
   `Mucopolysaccharidosis I' (which has synonym `Hurler-Pfaundler
   syndrome'; Disease or Syn- drome) * `Hurler-Scheie Syndrome' (Disease
   or Syndrome) The second sense is narrower than the first and so could
   be suppressed. 4.2.8 `Aminocaproic Acid ' * `6-Aminocaproic Acid'
   (Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein and Pharmacologic Substance) *
   `Aminocaproic Acids' (Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein and Pharmacologic
   Substance) This is a common type of ambiguity in the Metathesaurus in
   which a term represents both a group of something and a specific,
   usually paradigmatic instance of that group. For text processing pur-
   poses, it would help to suppress the group sense. Then the choice
   between the senses reduces to determining whether the form of the word
   acid is singular or plural. 4.2.9 `BL19 ' * `BL-19
   (epsilon-biotinamidocaproyl-beta-Ala-beta-Ala-lisinopril)' * `BL19
   Bladder Acupuncture Point' Both senses are abbreviatory and should be
   suppressed. 4.2.10 `Blood group antibody C' * `Blood group antibody C'
   (Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein and Immunologic Factor) * `Blood group
   antibody c' (Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein and Immunologic Factor)
   These two senses differ only by case. Since they have synonyms `Blood
   group antibody Rh2' and `Blood group antibody Rh4', respectively, they
   appear to represent legitimate ambiguity (assum- ing case
   insensitivity). 4.2.11 `Body Length ' * `Body Height' (Organism
   Attribute and Quantitative Concept) * `Length of body' (Organism
   Attribute) Oddly enough, `Length of body' is a child of `Body Height'
   in RCD99. Perhaps the senses are synonymous, but if not I would favor
   suppressing `Body Height'. 4.2.12 `BSE ' * `Breast Self-Examination' *
   `Encephalopathy, Bovine Spongiform' Both senses are abbreviatory and
   should be suppressed. Ambiguity in the UMLS Metathesaurus (2000
   Edition) 14 4. Ambiguity of Lesser Degree 4.2.13 `Comb ' *
   `bleomycin/cyclophosphamide/semustine/vincristine protocol' (with
   string `COMB') * `Comb animal structure' The first sense is
   abbreviatory (somehow) and should be suppressed. 4.2.14 `Context ' *
   `Context <1>' (Finding; child of `Attribute' in RCD99) * `context <2>'
   (Functional Concept; with string `setting' and child of `social
   psychology' in AOD95) The second sense is quite specific and could be
   suppressed. 4.2.15 `Cork ' * `Cork' * `Cork County, Ireland' The senses
   are legitimate. 4.2.16 `Crabs - pubic lice ' * `Infestation by Phthirus
   pubis' (Disease or Syndrome) * `Phthirus pubis' (Invertebrate) The
   senses seem legitimate. 4.2.17 `Degree ' * `Degree or extent' *
   `Academic degree' The senses are legitimate. 4.2.18 `Delusional
   Disorders ' * `Delusional disorder' * `Paranoid Schizophrenia' The
   second sense may be too specific and could be suppressed. 4.2.19
   `Duration ' * `Duration' * `Duration brand of oxymetazoline' The second
   sense should be suppressed due to its specific, contextual nature.
   4.2.20 `Dysfunction ' * `physiopathology' (Functional Concept) *
   `Functional disorder' (Pathologic Function) The first sense is a MeSH
   subheading and can be suppressed. 4.2.21 `Economics ' * `Economics'
   (Quantitative Concept and Occupation or Discipline) * `Economic'
   (Quantitative Concept and Functional Concept; with MSH2000 string
   `economics') Ambiguity in the UMLS Metathesaurus (2000 Edition) 15 4.
   Ambiguity of Lesser Degree The second sense is a MeSH subheading. In
   addition, this is another case where number makes a difference. For
   both reasons, the second sense should be suppressed. 4.2.22 `Esophageal
   Reflux ' * `Gastroesophageal reflux disease' (Disease or Syndrome) *
   `Esophageal reflux observation' (Finding) It seems unlikely that the
   text esophageal reflux would refer to the second sense, a finding. Thus
   the second sense could be suppressed. 4.2.23 `Ganglion ' * `Ganglia'
   (Body Part, Organ, or Organ Component) * `Benign cystic mucinous
   tumour' (Acquired Abnormality and Neoplastic Process) The senses seem
   legitimate. 4.2.24 `Glucosuria ' * `Glycosuria' (<1> and <2>) There is
   no ambiguity here. 4.2.25 `Glutamate ' * `Glutamates' (Amino Acid,
   Peptide, or Protein) * `Glutamate' (Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein and
   Biologically Active Substance) Suppress `Glutamates' and let text
   processing determine which sense is correct. 4.2.26 `GPA ' * `GPA <1>'
   (Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein and Immunologic Factor) * `Grade point
   average' (Intellectual Product) Both senses are abbreviatory and should
   be suppressed. (Note that the first sense has only one other string,
   `GPA'. It occurs in both LNC10M and PDQ99, but is not defined very
   well.) 4.2.27 `Homeopathy ' * `Homeopathy' (Biomedical Occupation or
   Discipline) * `Homeopathic therapy' (Therapeutic or Preventive
   Procedure) Both senses seem legitimate. 4.2.28 `Induced Abortion ' *
   `Abortion, Induced' (Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure) * `Diagnosis
   of induced abortion' (Finding) The two senses are not completely
   delineated in the Metathesaurus; nevertheless, they appear legitimate.
   4.2.29 `Influenza Virus ' * `Orthomyxoviridae' (Virus) *
   `Influenzavirus, NOS' (Virus) One definition for the first sense is A
   family of RNA viruses causing influenza and other diseases. There are
   three recognized genera: INFLUENZAVIRUS A, B; INFLUENZAVIRUS C; and
   Ambiguity in the UMLS Metathesaurus (2000 Edition) 16 4. Ambiguity of
   Lesser Degree THOGOTO-LIKE VIRUSES. Thus it may be too general to mean
   influenza virus. It could proba- bly be suppressed without doing any
   harm. 4.2.30 `Inner Ear ' * `Labyrinth' * `Diseases of inner ear' The
   second sense should be suppressed. 4.2.31 `Knee (right) ' * `Assessment
   of passive right knee joint movement' * `Assessment of active right
   knee joint movement' Both senses should be suppressed; they are
   essentially abbreviatory. 4.2.32 `Lice, Head ' * `Pediculus capitis
   infestation' * `Head Lice' Both senses seem legitimate. 4.2.33 `MAGE-3
   ' * `MAGE-3.1' (Pharmacologic Substance) * `MAGE-3 gene' (Gene or
   Genome) These senses seem to be distinct and hence legitimate. 4.2.34
   `Manic ' * `Manic' (Functional Concept) * `Manic mood' (Finding) Both
   senses seem legitimate. 4.2.35 `Mediation ' * `Negotiating' (Social
   Behavior) * `mediation <2>' (with just one string, `mediation' from
   AOD95') (Occupational Activity) Again, both senses are legitimate.
   4.2.36 `Metanephrine ' * `Metanephrine' (Organic Chemical and
   Neuroreactive Substance or Biogenic Amine) * `Metanephrine measurement'
   (Laboratory Procedure) This is the standard ambiguity between a
   substance and a laboratory procedure measuring it; both senses seem
   legitimate. 4.2.37 `Myelopathy ' * `Bone Marrow Diseases' * `Spinal
   Cord Diseases' These senses correspond to the two definitions of
   myelopathy in Dorland's and are therefore legit- imate. Ambiguity in
   the UMLS Metathesaurus (2000 Edition) 17 4. Ambiguity of Lesser Degree
   4.2.38 `Other maltreatment syndromes ' * `Other maltreatment syndromes
   - cause' (Injury or Poisoning) * `Other maltreatment syndromes -
   disorder' (Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction) These senses are confusing
   (and difficult to track down in the Metathesaurus). They could both be
   suppressed. 4.2.39 `Placidyl ' * `Ethchlorvynol measurement' *
   `Placidyl' This is the substance/measurement ambiguity again. 4.2.40
   `Pregnenolone ' * `Assay for pregnenolone' * `Pregnenolone' And again.
   4.2.41 `Rapid plasma reagin ' * `Rapid plasma reagin test procedure' *
   `Rapid plasma reagin' And yet again. 4.2.42 `S ANTIGEN:ARBITRARY
   CONCENTRATION:POINT IN TIME:ERYTHROCYTES^BLOOD PRODUCT UNIT:ORDINAL:RED
   BLOOD CELL AGGLUTINATION ' * `Upper case ess ANTIGEN:ARBITRARY
   SUBSTANCE CONCENTRATION:POINT IN TIME:ERYTHROCYTES^BLOOD PRODUCT
   UNIT:SEMI-QUANTITATIVE:RBC AGGLUTINATION' * `Lower case ess
   ANTIGEN:ARBITRARY SUBSTANCE CONCENTRATION:POINT IN
   TIME:ERYTHROCYTES^BLOOD PRODUCT UNIT:SEMI-QUANTITATIVE:RBC
   AGGLUTINATION' Since the strings will never occur in normal text, it
   makes no difference what is done here. 4.2.43 `Sedation ' * `Sedation
   procedure' (Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure) * `Sedation' (Sign or
   Symptom) Both senses are legitimate. 4.2.44 `Separated from cohabitee '
   * `Separated from cohabitee' (Social Behavior and Human-caused
   Phenomenon or Process) * `Separated from cohabitee <1>' (Spatial
   Concept) I believe that sense two is a child of sense one in RCD99. It
   could be suppressed as being only part of the more general social
   behavior. 4.2.45 `SHBG ' * `Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin' Ambiguity in
   the UMLS Metathesaurus (2000 Edition) 18 5. Summary and Conclusions *
   `Somatotropin binding globulin' Both senses are abbreviatory and should
   be suppressed. 4.2.46 `Shigella sonnei ' * `Shigella sonnei bacterium'
   * `Disease caused by Shigella sonnei' Both senses seem legitimate.
   (Note how this differs from `Prostate' vs. `Prostatic Diseases'.)
   4.2.47 `Sludge ' * `Sludge <1>' (Environmental Effect of Humans) *
   `Sludge, NOS' (Body Substance) Both senses seem legitimate. 4.2.48
   `Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins ' * `Thyroid stimulating
   immunoglobulins' * `Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins assay' This is
   the substance/measurement ambiguity again; both senses are legitimate.
   4.2.49 `Vascular resistance ' * `Vascular resistance' * `Vascular
   resistance measurement' Again the substance/measurement ambiguity.
   4.2.50 `Weight ' * `Body Weight' (Organism Attribute and Quantitative
   Concept) * `Weight' (Quantitative Concept) Both senses are legitimate.
   5. Summary and Conclusions As the Metathesaurus grows, so does the
   number of ambiguous concepts within it. But the ambi- guities of large
   degree, all of which are false ambiguities, are being made harmless
   largely by being marked as suppressible. Indeed, if the recommendations
   made earlier are followed, the greatest degree of remaining ambiguity
   will be of degree 4. The analysis described here reveals some classes
   of possible ambiguity commonly occurring in the Metathesaurus: * Body
   part/disease ambiguity. This class of false ambiguity is exemplified by
   `Prostate' and `Prostatic Diseases'. It arises from terms which require
   context within their vocabulary in order to be properly understood. *
   Abbreviatory ambiguity. This is another, large class of ambiguity
   caused by distinct concepts having the same acronyms (or
   abbreviations). An example from above is that `Mitral Valve Stenosis',
   `Multiple Sclerosis', `Morphine Sulfate' and `millisecond' all have
   abbreviation `MS' or `ms'. Although this class represents true
   ambiguity in a strict sense, it is better to disal- Ambiguity in the
   UMLS Metathesaurus (2000 Edition) 19 5. Summary and Conclusions low it
   in many text processing situations, especially those in which authors
   define the abbrevia- tions they use. Furthermore, because of the large
   number of expansions for most acronyms, it might make sense to disallow
   such ambiguity universally. * Substance/measurement ambiguity. This
   class, exemplified by `Thyroid stimulating immuno- globulins' and
   `Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins assay', represents true ambiguity,
   espe- cially in patient records but also in the biomedical literature.
   Trying to decide what level of ambiguity is acceptable in some textual
   application is analogous to determining what granularity of meaning is
   appropriate in a knowledge source such as the Meta- thesaurus.
   Different levels are appropriate for different purposes. For this
   reason, it remains to be decided where the recommendations in this
   report are implemented. Some of them, including the cases of ambiguity
   of large degree, should be handled by marking more Metathesaurus
   strings as suppressible. Others, including abbreviatory ambiguity, may
   best be handled outside the Meta- thesaurus. Ambiguity in the UMLS
