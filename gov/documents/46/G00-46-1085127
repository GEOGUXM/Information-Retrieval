                        COMMISSION UNIFORMITY PROCESS

   CAPTION:

     * The Commission's Uniformity Process
     * Current Uniformity
       Projects

       Symbol of interstate uniformity

   "Promot[ing] uniformity or compatibility in significant components of
   tax systems" is an explictly-stated, core purpose of the Multistate Tax
   Compact. However, the development and adoption by the Compact Member
   States of model statutes, regulations, and policy guidelines is an
   important means of achieving the other three stated purposes of the
   Compact as well:
     * "Facilitat[ing] proper determination of State and local tax
       liability of multistate taxpayers, including the equitable
       apportionment of tax bases and settlement of apportionment
       disputes"
     * "Facilitat[ing] taxpayer convenience and compliance in the filing
       of tax returns and in other phases of tax administration" and
     * "Avoid[ing] duplicative taxation."

   Fulfilling the Commission's Purposes

   A major focus of the Commission's uniformity work throughout its 30
   year history has been the development of business income tax allocation
   and apportionment regulations. Like most tax statutes, the Uniform
   Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act (UDITPA, which is embodied in
   Article IV of the Compact), provides only a broad framework. Extensive
   regulations are essential to the effective application of UDITPA to the
   complex and widely varying operations of business taxpayers.
   Accordingly, development of generalized allocation and apportionment
   regulations under Article IV was one of the first major initiatives
   undertaken by the MTC. The Commission issued the first set of such
   regulations in 1971 and revised them significantly in 1973.

   By providing substantially greater detail than does UDITPA, the
   Commission's recommended apportionment and allocation regulations help
   to "facilitate proper determination of State and local tax liability of
   multistate taxpayers, including the equitable apportionment of tax
   bases. . . ." This is especially true with respect to the service
   industries that now comprise a much larger share of our nation's
   economic base than they did at the time of UDITPA's adoption: the
   Commission has recommended special apportionment rules for interstate
   trucking, railroads, airlines, construction contractors, television and
   radio broadcasters, publishers, and, most recently, financial
   institutions.

   If the recommended allocation and apportionment regulations were
   universally adopted, the possibility of "duplicative taxation" would be
   substantially eliminated. The regulations are intended to remove
   ambiguity and ensure that all of a business' property, payroll, and
   sales are assigned to the numerator of oneand only oneState's
   apportionment factor.

   "Facilitat[ing] taxpayer convenience and compliance" is another
   important goal of increased state tax uniformity. If tax laws and
   regulations are substantially uniform, the burdens imposed upon
   businesses of tracking different state rules over time, of maintaining
   separate spreadsheets, work papers, and supporting records to reflect
   these different rules, and of completing base and apportionment factor
   calculations may be significantly lessened.

   Uniformity in Law and Joint Administrative Mechanisms: A "Synergistic"
   Relationship

   Substantial uniformity among the States in their laws and regulations
   also increases the efficiency of joint state administrative and
   enforcement mechanisms. In turn, joint enforcement and administrative
   mechanisms can themselves contribute to uniformity where it ultimately
   matters most: at the individual taxpayer level. The Commission's Joint
   Audit Program is a case in point: joint auditing encourages consistent
   treatment among the States in situations in which the laws and
   regulations are largely congruent but significant judgment is
   nonetheless involved in applying the rules to complex fact situations.
   For example, unless state rules are truly inconsistent, an auditor
   conducting a joint audit will not make inconsistent determinations
   regarding the composition of a unitary group for combined reporting
   purposes or the identification of business and non-business income. In
   contrast, inconsistent treatment of these matters can easily result
   when individual States conduct their own audits and make their own
   determinations. (Inconsistent treatment in these circumstances can, of
   course, lead to duplicative taxation.)

   The relationship between uniform laws and regulations and joint tax
   administrative mechanisms is a "synergistic" one. Greater uniformity
   among the States in their laws and regulations facilitates the creation
   of and participation in joint tax administrative mechanisms like the
   Commission's Joint Audit and National Nexus Programs. These, in turn,
   are an effective means of achieving the ultimate goal of interstate
   uniformity: consistent and fair treatment at the individual taxpayer
   level. And in some situations, joint administration or enforcement has
   identified significant policy matters for which a uniform law or
   regulation was seen as desirable and was, in fact, adopted by the
   Commission.

   An Invitation to the Business Community and the Public

   The Multistate Tax Commission welcomes the active participation of the
   business community and the public in its uniformity efforts. States are
   much more likely to move toward more uniform tax policies, laws, and
   rules if business and other interested groups support such changes. If
   the majority of the business community wants greater state tax
   uniformity, that majority needs to be heard throughout the Commission's
   uniformity proposal development process and the States' consideration
   of the Commission's recommendations.

   The Multistate Tax Commission invites tax officials and taxpayers alike
   to consider whether the model regulations, statutes, and guidelines
   available for review here can contribute to fair, efficient, and
   effective taxation of interstate commerce. To the extent that they fall
   short, we invite you to work with us to improve them. Please feel free
   to contact the Commission if you have observations or suggestions
   regarding any of its uniformity recommendations or current uniformity
   projects. We welcome your input.
