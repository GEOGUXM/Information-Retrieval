  USGS Nearshore Benthic Habitat Project
     __________________________________________________________________

   The nearshore benthic habitat supports a diversity of marine life that
   are commercially, recreationally, and intrinsically valuable. Some of
   these resources are known to be endangered including species of
   rockfish and shellfish. State and National agencies have been mandated
   to preserve and enhance these resources and require detailed habitat
   characterization in order to do so. The Nearshore Benthic Habitats
   Project of the USGS Western Region Coastal and Marine Geology Team will
   map the benthic habitat in areas that have been selected because they
   have been set aside as National Marine Sanctuaries, National Parks,
   State Fish Preserves, or are areas of ongoing or planned fish
   population studies.

   Presently, two areas are under study:
     * Alaskan Biologic Habitats

     * Glacier Bay National Park Project results from 1996 field work.
     * Preliminary results from 1997 Field Work in Glacier Bay
     * Preliminary results from 1998 Field Work in Glacier Bay
     * Bristol Bay Seafloor Characterization

     The Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, National Park, and
   Southern California State Fish Preserves
     * Preliminary results from 1998 Field Work in the Channel Islands
     * Sustainable Seas Submersible Project

   For additional information contact the project coordinator, Guy R.
   Cochrane.
