   Programs
   Information Systems
   Advanced Information Systems Technology - Addresses the technology
   areas of open distributed architectures, interactive access, storage
   management, science processing, automated system operations, and
   network prototypes.

   AIST Prototyping System (APS) - The APS is a quick turn around,
   peer-reviewed solicitation process which meets specific AIST needs for
   complementing existing technology investments and solicits ideas from
   the Earth and information science communities to fill technology
   investment gaps. [aps.jpg]
   Computational Technologies - The goal of NASA's Computational
   Technologies (CT) Project is to demonstrate high-end computational
   modeling to further our understanding and ability to predict the
   dynamic interaction of physical, chemical, and biological processes
   affecting the Earth.

   Instrument Systems

   Advanced Component Technologies - Focus requirements, define technology
   road maps, refine reference mission scenarios, advance component and
   subsystem developments, and leverage technology investments within the
   Agency, with other government agencies, with the Earth Science
   Enterprise international partner space agencies, and with private
   industry.

   Instrument Incubator Program - Enable the rapid development of new,
   less costly, and less resource intensive scientific instruments and
   measurement techniques by the aggressive pursuit and infusion of
   emerging and revolutionary technologies, bringing instrument system
   concepts to the appropriate state of technology readiness so that
   flight instruments can be developed and delivered within short windows
   of opportunity.
