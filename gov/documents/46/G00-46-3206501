     Association of American Indian Physicians launched a special web
     project with the American Indian Campaign on December 4, 1998 during
     the Association for American Indian Physicians Annual Mid-Year Meeting
     "Traditional and Non-Traditional Approaches to Diabetes in Native
     Communities" in Denver, Colorado. The purpose of the NDEP American
     Indian Campaign was to provide education about diabetes to American
     Indian communities.

     The American Indian Subcommittee is currently overseeing the
     development of message concepts for future radio and TV public service
     announcements that will provide education about diabetes prevention and
     treatment to American Indian communities. This campaign is a part of
     the National Diabetes Education Program, a national effort sponsored by
     the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health
     and is an integral part of the new AAIP program.
