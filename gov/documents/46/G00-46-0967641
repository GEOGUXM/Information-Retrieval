Economist's Viewpoint*

     * If Stennis Space Center had not been in operation in 2000,
       considering both direct and indirect effects, a very conservative
       estimate of reduction in employment for the local area would be
       24,121 jobs.
     * A similar conservative estimate indicates that personal income
       would have been reduced by more than $807 million, and retail sales
       would have been reduced by $323 million.
     * It is estimated that SSC has a tax revenue impact on local
       government of $87 million.

   Mississippi State University, January 2001.
