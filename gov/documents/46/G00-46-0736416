                  Catch the Wave: Equatorial Pacific Waves

     This eleven-day SeaWiFS chlorophyll-a composite January 8-18, 2002
      shows the rather remarkable development of a series of equatorial
        Pacific tropical instability waves. The enhanced chlorophyll
    concentrations associated with the waves extend from the region just
     west of the Galapagos Islands along the equator to the dateline - a
                    distance of nearly 10,000 kilometers.

    research and educational use only. All commercial use of SeaWiFS data
                     must be coordinated with ORBIMAGE.
