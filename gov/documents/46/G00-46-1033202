   Abstract

   The stone test wall was constructed  to study the performance of stone
   subjected to weathering. It contains 2352 individual samples of stone,
   of which 2032 are domestic stone from 47 states, and 320 are stones
   from 16 foreign countries. Over 30 distinct types of stones are
   represented, some of which are not commonly used for building purposes.
   There are many varieties of the common types used in building, such as
   marble, limestone, sandstone, and granite.
