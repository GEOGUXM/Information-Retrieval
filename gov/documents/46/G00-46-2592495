       _______________________________________________________________

   The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee recently recommended
   improvements to the community mental health delivery system as part of
   a performance audit.  The improvements, including the development of an
   outcome-based performance system, are to be implemented by the
   Department of Social and Health Services beginning in June 2001 and
   thereafter.

   In the legislation implementing audit recommendations (ESSB 5583), the
   2001 Legislature mandated that the Institute conduct a longitudinal
   study of long-term client outcomes to assess any changes in client
   status at two, five and ten years.

   This evaluation will assess if clients change as a result of services,
   employment, education, housing stability, criminal justice involvement
   and level of services needed.

   The final evaluation report is due December 2005.
