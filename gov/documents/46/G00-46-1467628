     This ultrasonic drilling mechanism does not require high axial load

   This Website describes the JPL's NDEAA ultrasonic drilling activity.
   This task is seeking to develop an ultrasonic/sonic driller/corer
   (USDC) to enable collecting samples from various planets or small
   bodies (e.g., asteroid) using low axial load and low power. The drill
   bit not does require sharpening, it has self-removal of debris, can be
   made to operate at cryogenic and high temperatures, non-round cross
   section cores can be criated and it can be used to probe the ground as
   well as deliver in-situ sensing down the well.
   Ultrasonic and sonic vibrations are responsible for the drilling
   action. Piezoelectric material in the upper section excites these
   vibrations. Flashlight battery can drive this drill. The drill bit is
   forced to go up and down but it does not rotate. The impact of the bit
   into the rock performs the drilling. The device is being developed in
   cooperation with Cybersonics (under an SBIR contract), where finite
   element analytical modeling is being developed to optimize the
   operation of the device. The USDC was demonstrated to operate from a
   Sojourner size rover as well as from the robotic arm of the FIDO rover.
   The drill head currently weighs .4-kg (1-lb), requires axial load at
   the level of 3-10N and was operated by as low as 3-W. So far
   demonstrate 25-mm (1-inch) deep holes in granite from a 4-kg platform,
   15-cm and 15-mm diameter in sandstone.
   The USDC was selected the NASA/JPL Technology Spotlight for the month
   of April 2000. Further, USDC was selected by R&D Magazine (in the Sept.
   2000 issue, p. 135) as one of the 100 most innovative instruments for
   the year 2000
