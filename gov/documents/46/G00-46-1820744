                    Pegasus Hypersonic Flight Experiment

   NASA Pegasus Hypersonic Experiment Successfully Flown October 22, 1998
                         By Rex Churchward, Code ASM

   The most recent Orbital Science Pegasus Mission to deliver a Brazilian
   Satellite to earth orbit and to fly a NASA Hypersonics experiment was a
   huge success. The payload was placed at the desired orbit and the NASA
   Glove assembly transmitted hypersonic flight data that will aid in the
   design of future high-speed vehicles. There has not been a flight to
   validate computer code solutions since the X-15 flew some 30 years ago.
   Several technological advancements in materials, construction, and
   electronic data collection/transmission were made in the effort to
   build and fly the glove.

   The glove program was a joint effort between NASA Langley, Dryden, and
   Ames Research Centers. The original concept was conceived by
   participants from all three centers. The final design and construction
   was carried out at NASA Dryden. NASA KSC provided launch support
   services for those that traveled to Cape Canaveral to take part in the
   launch of the experiment. The success of the mission was due to the
   tremendous effort of all who contributed to the design, construction,
   and launch.

                        NASA Ames Role In the Program

   The major contribution to the glove assembly were the Ames instrumented
   TUFI-20 tiles, which surround the metallic portion of the glove. The
   entire methodology was developed by Ames personnel and was a
   demonstration of the most cost-effective means of applying instrumented
   reusable tiles to an aerospace vehicle. The technology will be passed
   to NASA industry partners for use on future aerospace vehicles. Ames
   also provided Materials Engineering support during the design phase of
   the program and QA certification of the various adhesive bonds that
   held the glove intact during the flight.

   The quality of the temperature data generated by the Ames instrumented
   tiles was excellent. The response of the tile-temperature hardware was
   sufficient to collect the rapid increase in leading edge surface
   temperatures. There were approximately 24 type K thermocouples
   installed into the inboard set of tiles. The leading edge tile
   contained the greatest number of surface thermocouples. There is now
   sufficient data to validate leading edge models that have been
   generated from computer code and Arc Jet phenomena. The flight
   experiment also helped validate the instrumentation methodology that
   will be used on the leeward side of the X-33 vehicle.

   The following branches and individuals at Ames deserve congratulations
   on a job well done.
