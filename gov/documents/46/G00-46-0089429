                          Washington at a Glance...

   Washington State is the choice for many U.S. and international
   businesses seeking a new site for business growth. Washingtons
   location on the Pacific Rim makes it a convenient location for
   businesses focused on Asian markets, or for distribution businesses
   directed at the U.S. market. The polar route means that Europe is as
   close as Asia. The states highly trained and motivated work force,
   superior education system, low-cost energy rates and desirable living
   conditions not only entice companies to move to the state, they
   encourage existing businesses to focus expansion plans close to home.

   Washington recently attracted world-class companies, such as Boise
   Cascade, Consolidated Freightways, MicroChip, Rockport Projects
   Limited, Toyocom, Westech Aerosol, and Wheeling Corrugated. These
   companies represent approximately $1.2 billion business investment and
   2,050 new jobs.

   website and our Business Development Website.
