   CHALLENGES Chris Quigg Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory P.O. Box
   500, Batavia, Illinois 60510 USA 1 Introduction We gather in Ho Chi
   Minh City with high expectations for the future of particle physics and
   high hopes for the future of science in Vietnam. We are in the midst of
   a revolution in our perceptions of nature, when the achievements of our
   science have brought our insights closer to everyday life than ever
   before. I will devote this lecture to seven themes that express the
   essence of our understanding--and our possibilities. 2 Elementarity One
   of the pillars of our understanding is the identification of a set of
   fundamental constituents, the leptons *e e ! *_ _ ! *o/ o/ ! ; and the
   quarks u d ! c s ! t b ! ; which have no internal structure, no size,
   no form factors, and no excited states--so far as we know. The quarks
   are color triplets, so experience the strong interactions, whereas the
   leptons, color singlets, do not. The charged leptons and the quarks are
   Dirac particles with gyromagnetic ratio g = 2 (+ the amount induced by
   interactions). The size of the fermions is smaller than the current
   limit of experimental resolution characterized by a radius R ,!
   10\Gamma 17 cm.1) We don't yet know whether the neutrinos are massive
   or not. If neutrinos do have mass, they may be either Dirac or Majorana
   particles.2) All the experimental evidence leads us to conclude that
   quarks and leptons are the fundamental (constituent) degrees of freedom
   at current energies. We regard them as elementary. What if they were
   not? What if quarks and leptons were composite? Opening Lecture at the
   Second Rencontres du Vietnam, October 21-28, 1995. hep-ph/9511438
   FERMILAB-CONF-95/353-T Approaching the compositeness scale from low
   energies, we would encounter new contact interactions that correspond
   to the exchange or rearrangement of constituents.3) In quark-quark
   scattering, the conventional gluon exchange would be supplemented by a
   contact term of geometrical size and unknown Lorentz structure. In _pp
   collisions, this new contribution would lead to an excess (over QCD) of
   hadron jets at large values of the transverse energy, where _qq ! _qq
   is the dominant elementary reaction. In general, the angular
   distribution of the jets will differ from the standard QCD shape. If
   quarks and leptons have common constituents, a similar excess will be
   seen in dilepton production, from the elementary process _qq !
   `+`\Gamma . At still higher energies, we expect to see the effects of
   excited q\Lambda and `\Lambda states.4) Finally, at energies well above
   the compositeness scale, quarks and leptons would begin to manifest
   form factors. No experimental evidence except history suggests that
   quarks and leptons are composite. However, compositeness might explain
   the fermion mass spectrum, the existence of generations, and the
   relationship of quarks and leptons. No composite model has yet achieved
   these breakthroughs,5) so the search for compositeness is a purely
   experimental exercise. The discovery of compositeness would alter our
   conception of matter in a fundamental way. 3 Symmetry The other
   essential ingredient in the standard model is the notion that
   continuous local symmetries-- gauge symmetries--determine the character
   of the fundamental interactions. The simplest, and classic, example is
   the derivation of quantum electrodynamics from local phase invariance.
   The quantum mechanics of a free particle is invariant under global
   changes of phase of the wave function, (x) ! ei`(x): (3.1) This is the
   symmetry associated with charge conservation. Requiring a theory
   invariant under local changes of phase, (x) ! ei`(x)(x); (3.2) demands
   the introduction of a massless vector field, identified as the photon,
   and leads to a full theory of electrodynamics, QED.6) The same general
   strategy can be applied to any continuous symmetry. That insight links
   the problem of building theories of the fundamental interactions to the
   search for the right symmetries to gauge. Let us review the electroweak
   theory as an example. The crucial experimental clues for the
   construction of a gauge theory of the weak and electromagnetic
   interactions are the family pattern embodied in the left-handed
   weak-isospin doublets of leptons and quarks and the universal strength
   of the charged-current weak interactions. It is straightforward to
   construct the theory, which I will write down for one generation of
   leptons, idealizing the neutrinos as massless. To incorporate SU (2)L
   weak-isospin symmetry, we define a left-handed doublet, L j *Le L ! =
   12 (1 \Gamma fl5)* 12 (1 \Gamma fl5)e ! ; (3.3) and a right-handed
   singlet, R j eR = 12(1 + fl5)e: (3.4) To include electromagnetism, we
   define the weak hypercharge through Q = I3 + 12Y , so that YL = \Gamma
   1, YR = \Gamma 2. The gauge group SU (2)L \Omega U (1)Y allows two
   coupling constants, g for the SU (2)L gauge bosons b1_; b2_; b3_, and
   12g0 for the U (1) gauge boson A_. We may write the Lagrangian as L =
   Lgauge + Lleptons; (3.5) 2 hep-ph/9511438 FERMILAB-CONF-95/353-T where
   Lgauge = \Gamma 14 F `_* F `_* \Gamma 14f_* f _* , with F `_* = @* b`_
   \Gamma @_b`* + g"jk`bj_bk* and f_* = @* A_ \Gamma @_A* , and the matter
   term is Lleptons = _Rifl_ `@_ + ig 0 2 A_Y ' R + _Lifl _ `@_ + ig0 2
   A_Y + ig 2 ~o/ \Delta ~b_' L: (3.6) Explicit mass terms for the gauge
   bosons or fermions are inconsistent with the gauge symmetry.
   Accordingly, this theory has a massless neutrino, a massless electron,
   and four massless electroweak gauge bosons. Nature has a massive
   electron, a massless neutrino, three massive gauge bosons, and but one
   massless electroweak gauge boson, the photon. The minimal solution to
   this mismatch is to hide the gauge symmetry by means of the Higgs
   mechanism. We introduce a complex weak-isospin doublet of scalar
   fields, OE = OE + OE0 ! ; (3.7) with weak hypercharge YOE = +1. Add to
   the Lagrangian a piece Lscalar = (D_OE)y(D_OE) \Gamma V (OEyOE); (3.8)
   where the gauge-covariant derivative is D_ = @_ + ig 0 2 A_Y + ig 2 ~o/
   \Delta ~b_, and the Higgs potential isV (OEyOE) = _2(OEyOE) +
   j*j(OEyOE)2. We are also free to add the interactions of the scalars
   with the fermions, L Yukawa = \Gamma Ge h_R(OEyL) + (_LOE)Ri : (3.9) If
   _2 ! 0, the vacuum state corresponds to a nonzero value of the scalar
   field, which we choose to be h OEi0 = 0v=p2 ! = 0(G F p8)\Gamma 1=2 ! :
   (3.10) (The last identification ensures that the theory reproduces the
   low-energy charged-current phenomenology.) The nonzero value of hOEi0
   hides (or breaks) the SU (2)L and U (1)Y symmetries, but preserves a
   residual invariance under U (1)EM. The spectrum of the broken theory
   consists of a massless photon A_ = A_ cos `W + b3_ sin `W , with
   coupling gg0=pg2 + g02 j e; charged vector bosons W \Sigma _ = (b1_
   \Upsilon ib2_)=p2, with M 2W = ssff=GF p2 sin2 `W ; a neutral
   intermediate boson Z_ = b3_ cos `W \Gamma A_ sin `W , with MZ = MW=cos
   `W ; a neutral Higgs scalar, with M 2H = \Gamma 2_2 ? 0; and an
   electron with mass me = Gev=p2. The predicted masses for the W \Sigma
   and Z0 are expressed in terms of the weak mixing parameter sin2 `W ,
   which is measured in neutral-current reactions. It is both a triumph
   and a frustration of the electroweak theory that spontaneous symmetry
   breaking plus Yukawa couplings generates fermion masses, for the Yukawa
   couplings are not calculable within the theory. 4 Consistency The
   leptonic and hadronic charged weak currents are identical in form,
   characterized by the lefthanded doublets *e e !L ; u d` !L ; (4.1) etc.
   Renormalizability requires the absence of anomalies--quantum violations
   of classical symmetries or conservation laws. For the electroweak
   theory, the condition for anomaly freedom can be expressed in the
   requirement \Delta Q = QR \Gamma QL = X RH doublets Q \Gamma X LH
   doublets Q = 0: (4.2) In an electroweak theory based on the lepton
   doublet (*e e)L, \Delta Q(leptons) = \Gamma QL = +1 6= 0. To cancel the
   lepton anomaly, we could add right-handed fermions with appropriate
   charges, but no 3 hep-ph/9511438 FERMILAB-CONF-95/353-T right-handed
   charged-current interactions are known. More to the point, we can add a
   color triplet of left-handed quark doublets (u d`)L, for which \Delta
   Q(quarks) = \Gamma 3( 23 \Gamma 13 ) = \Gamma 1, so that \Delta Q =
   \Delta Q(leptons) + \Delta Q(quarks) = 0. It is remarkable that a
   consistent theory of weak and electromagnetic interactions requires
   quarks as well as leptons. This suggests a deep connection between
   quarks and leptons that I take as an important clue toward a more
   complete theory. 5 Unity Making connections is the essence of
   scientific progress. For monumental examples, think of the amalgamation
   of electricity and magnetism and light; of the recognition that heat is
   atoms in motion, which brought together thermodynamics and Newtonian
   mechanics; and of the realization that the chemical properties of
   substances are determined by the atomic and molecular structure of
   matter. Each of these unifications brought new understanding and
   illuminated phenomena beyond those that served as motivation. What
   progress might we achieve by unifying the quarks and leptons, or the
   strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions described by the SU (3)c
   \Omega SU (2)L \Omega U (1)Y gauge theories, or both? The link between
   quarks and leptons implied by anomaly cancellation is reinforced by the
   following set of questions: Can we understand why (i) electric charge
   is quantized? (ii) Qp + Qe = 0? (iii) Q* \Gamma Qe = Qu \Gamma Qd? (iv)
   Qd = Qe=3? (v) Q* + Qe + 3Qu + 3Qd = 0? What observations motivate a
   unified theory of the fundamental interactions? Beyond the similarities
   and links between quarks and leptons, we recognize that the SU (2)L
   \Omega U (1)Y elctroweak theory achieves only a partial unification of
   the weak and electromagnetic interactions, as evidenced by the fact
   that sin2 `W is a free parameter of the theory. Taken together, quantum
   chromodynamics and the electroweak theory have three distinct coupling
   parameters, (ffs; ffEM; sin2 `W ) or, equivalently, (ff3; ff2; ff1).
   Might we reduce the number of independent couplings to two or one? As
   we shall review presently, the evolution of the gauge couplings
   suggests that coupling-constant unification might be possible. The
   minimal example of a theory that unifies the quarks and leptons and the
   fundamental interactions is based on the gauge group SU (5).7) The
   gauge bosons of SU (5) lie in the adjoint 24 representation.
   Decomposing these particles according to their (SU (3)c; SU (2)L)Y
   quantum numbers, we recognize (8; 1)0 : gluons; (1; 3)0 : W +; W \Gamma
   ; W3; (1; 1)0 : A; (5.1) the twelve gauge bosons of (unbroken) SU (3)c
   \Omega SU (2)L \Omega U (1)Y , plus twelve new force particles whose
   existence is implied by the unification: (3; 2)\Gamma 5=3 : X\Gamma
   4=3; Y \Gamma 1=3; (3\Lambda ; 2)5=3 : X4=3; Y 1=3: (5.2) These
   additional interactions mediate baryon- and lepton-number-violating
   processes. The fundamental fermions fit in the 5\Lambda and 10
   representations of SU (5), with *e; eL; dcL 2 5\Lambda and ecL; uL; dL;
   ucL 2 10, where I have used charge-conjugate fields to represent the
   right-handed degrees of freedom. It is a straightforward matter to
   compute the evolution of the SU (3)c \Omega SU (2)L \Omega U (1)Y gauge
   couplings.8) Writing ffi = g2i =4ss, we have to leading logarithmic

   the weak mixing parameter in the three-generation SU (5) model. Let us
   summarize the standing of the SU (5) example of a unified theory. SU
   (5) contains the standard-model gauge group SU (3)c \Omega SU (2)L
   \Omega U (1)Y in a simple group, and thus reduces the number of
   independent couplings from three to one. By construction, the theory
   gives a correct description of the charged-current weak interactions.
   So far as the neutral-current interactions are concerned, it predicts a
   value of the weak mixing parameter that is close to, but not identical
   with, the observed value. SU (5) naturally explains the quantization of
   electric charge. Since the electriccharge operator Q is a generator of
   SU (5), the sum of electric charges over any representation must be
   zero. This means in particular that Q(dc) = (\Gamma 1=3)Q(e). Proton
   decay is possible, through the action of the color-triplet gauge bosons
   X and Y .11) And of course, aspirations remain, even beyond a unified
   theory of the strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions, for
   gravitation is omitted from the theory. 6 Identity What makes a bottom
   quark a bottom quark, or an electron an electron? One of the great
   unsolved problems of the standard model is how to calculate fermion
   masses and mixing angles. In the electroweak theory, the Higgs
   mechanism produces fermion masses, as a result of spontaneous symmetry
   breaking. Recall that for a single generation of leptons, the Yukawa
   interaction is LYukawa = \Gamma Ge h_R(OEyL) + (_LOE)Ri ; (6.1) where
   the left-handed lepton doublet is L = *ee ! L (6.2) and R = eR is the
   right-handed electron. The interaction (6.1) is the most general
   Lorentz scalar invariant under local SU (3)c \Omega U (1)Y
   transformations. The electroweak theory offers no guidance about the
   value of the Yukawa coupling. For the electron, Ge ss 3 \Theta 10\Gamma
   6, while the analogous coupling for the top quark is Gt ss 1. For three
   generations of quarks and leptons, we can generalize (6.1) to LYukawa =
   _uiRUij( _OEyuQj) + _diRDij(OEydQj ) + _eiREij(OEydLj); (6.3) where Qj
   = ujd j !L Lj = *j `j !L ; (6.4) 6 hep-ph/9511438
   FERMILAB-CONF-95/353-T and Uij ; Dij; and Eij are complex 3 \Theta 3
   matrices. In the electroweak theory, OEu = OEd = OE, with hOEi0 given
   by (3.10), whereas in the minimal supersymmetric generalization, OEu
   and OEd are distinct. The ratio of their vacuum expectation values is
   parametrized as tan fi = vu=vd. Unified theories imply relations among
   fermion masses. In the example of SU (5), spontaneous symmetry breaking
   occurs in two steps. First, an adjoint 24 of scalars breaks SU (5) ! SU
   (3)c \Omega SU (2)L \Omega U (1)Y ; (6.5) and gives very large masses
   to the X\Sigma 4=3 and Y \Sigma 1=3 gauge bosons. But because the 24
   does not occur in the _LR products 5\Lambda \Omega 10 = 5 \Phi 45 and
   10 \Omega 10 = 5\Lambda \Phi 45\Lambda \Phi 50\Lambda , no fermion
   masses are generated at this stage. Electroweak symmetry is broken by
   the SU (5) generalization of the usual Higgs mechanism, a 5 of scalars
   that contains the standard-model Higgs doublet: SU (3)c \Omega SU (2)L
   \Omega U (1)Y ! SU (3)c \Omega U (1)EM: (6.6) This pattern of symmetry
   breaking leads to the relations me = md; m_ = ms; mo/ = mb; (6.7) at
   the unification scale. The masses of the charge-2/3 quarks are separate
   parameters mu; mc; mt. Like the values of coupling constants, the
   values of particle masses depend on the scale on which they are
   observed. In leading logarithmic approximation, the running masses of
   the up-like quarks evolve as ln mu;c;t(_) ss ln mu;c;t(MU ) + 1233
   \Gamma 2n f ln ` ff3(_) ffU ' + 2788 \Gamma 8n f ln ` ff2(_) ffU '

   + 2788 \Gamma 8n f ln ` ff2(_) ffU ' + 3 20nf ln ` ff1(_) ffU ' ; (6.9)
   and the masses of the charged leptons evolve as ln me;_;o/ (_) ss ln
   me;_;o/ (MU ) + 2788 \Gamma 8n f ln ` ff2(_) ffU ' \Gamma 27 20nf ln `
   ff1(_) ffU ' : (6.10) Accordingly, the masses of the b-quark and the o/
   -lepton evolve to different values at low energies: ln ^ mb(_)m o/ (_)*
   ss 12 33 \Gamma 2nf ln ` ff3(_) ffU ' + 3 2nf ln ` ff1(_) ffU ' :
   (6.11) Choosing nf = 6, 1=ffU = 40, 1=ff3(_) = 5, and 1=ff1 = 65, we
   compute (which is to say, predict) mb = 2:91mo/ = 5:16 GeV=c2; (6.12)
   in good agreement with the facts. To make this simple estimate, I have
   neglected the change in evolution at top threshold. Higgs-boson
   contributions, omitted here, are important for the evolution of
   heavy-fermion masses. The top Yukawa coupling plays a crucial role in
   supersymmetric models. 7 hep-ph/9511438 FERMILAB-CONF-95/353-T Starting
   from the equalities ms(MU ) = m_(MU ) and md(MU ) = me(MU ), equations
   (6.9) and (6.10) lead to the prediction that at _ ss 1 GeV, ms md = m_
   me : (6.13) This is less successful; empirically, the left-hand-side is
   about 20, and the right-hand-side about 200. A more elaborate scheme
   for breaking the electroweak symmetry--say, adding a 45 of scalars--can
   give rise to a different simple pattern of masses at the unification
   scale. The simple pattern ms(MU ) = 13m_(MU ); md(MU ) = 3me(MU )
   (6.14) leads to ms ss 43m_; md ss 12me; (6.15) at _ = 1 GeV. The
   important point in these exercises is not that SU (5) gives us an
   understanding of the pattern of fermion masses, but the more general
   lesson that a simple pattern at the unification scale can manifest
   itself in a complicated (irrational!) pattern at low energies. This
   insight has spawned a new strategy for making sense of the pattern of
   fermion masses--and a new industry for theorists.12) Begin with a
   promising unified theory, like supersymmetric SU (5), which has
   advantages over ordinary SU (5) for sin2 `W , coupling constant
   unification, and the proton lifetime, or supersymmetric SO(10), which
   can accommodate massive neutrinos. Then find "textures," simple
   patterns of Yukawa matrices that lead to successful predictions for
   masses and mixing angles. Interpret these in terms of patterns of
   electroweak symmetry breaking. Finally, seek a derivation of--or at
   least a motivating principle for--the winning entry. The proof that
   this program has predictive power is that some schemes fail for mt or
   jVcbj. 7 Opportunity As successful as the electroweak theory is in
   describing experimental observations,13) we do not need hints from
   experiment to know that the theory is incomplete.14) We have only to
   look at the many parameters of the SU (3)c \Omega SU (2)L \Omega U (1)Y
   gauge theories of the strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions to
   see opportunities for a more predictive theory. The 6 quark masses, 3
   charged-lepton masses, 4 quark-mixing parameters, 3 coupling constants,
   2 parameters of the Higgs potential, and 1 strong (CP ) phase make 19
   parameters whose values are not explained by the standard model.
   Seventeen of these numbers lie in the domain of the electroweak theory.
   Next, we can inquire into the self-consistency and naturalness of the
   electroweak theory. The hierarchy, naturalness, and triviality problems
   indicate that the electroweak theory is not complete. As an
   illustration of these shortcomings, let us ask why the electroweak
   scale is small. Note that we do have some understanding, from the
   evolution of coupling constants down from the unification scale, of why
   the strong interaction becomes strong at a scale of about 1 GeV. The SU
   (2)L \Omega U (1)Y electroweak theory does not explain how the scale of
   electroweak symmetry breaking is maintained in the presence of quantum
   corrections. The problem of the scalar sector can be summarized neatly
   as follows.15) The Higgs potential is V (OEyOE) = _2(OEyOE) + j*j
   (OEyOE)2 : (7.1) With _2 chosen to be less than zero, the electroweak
   symmetry is spontaneously broken down to the U (1) of electromagnetism,
   as the scalar field acquires a vacuum expectation value that is fixed
   by the low-energy phenomenology, hOEi0 = 0p\Gamma _2=2j*j ! j 0v=p2 ! =
   (GF p8)\Gamma 1=2 ss 175 GeV : (7.2) 8 hep-ph/9511438
   FERMILAB-CONF-95/353-T Three of the scalar degrees of freedom become
   the longitudinal components of the intermediate vector bosons W +; W
   \Gamma ; and Z0. The fourth emerges as a massive scalar particle, the
   Higgs boson, with mass given by M 2H = 2j*jv2: (7.3) Beyond the
   classical approximation, scalar mass parameters receive quantum
   corrections from loops that contain particles of spins J = 1; 1=2, and
   0: + + + + J=1 J=1/2 J=0 m 2(p 2) = m 02 + (7.4) The loop integrals are
   potentially divergent. Symbolically, we may summarize the content of
   (7.4) as m2(p2) = m2(\Lambda 2) + Cg2 Z \Lambda 2 p2 dk 2 + \Delta
   \Delta \Delta ; (7.5) where \Lambda defines a reference scale at which
   the value of m2 is known, g is the coupling constant of the theory, and
   the coefficient C is calculable in any particular theory. Instead of
   dealing with the relationship between observables and parameters of the
   Lagrangian, we choose to describe the variation of an observable with
   the momentum scale. In order for the mass shifts induced by radiative
   corrections to remain under control (i.e., not to greatly exceed the
   value measured on the laboratory scale), either \Lambda must be small,
   so the range of integration is not enormous, or new physics must
   intervene to cut off the integral. If the fundamental interactions are
   described by an SU (3)c \Omega SU (2)L \Omega U (1)Y gauge symmetry,
   i.e., by quantum chromodynamics and the electroweak theory, then the
   natural reference scale is the Planck mass, \Lambda , MPlanck ss 1019
   GeV : (7.6) In a unified theory of the strong, weak, and
   electromagnetic interactions, the natural scale is the unification
   scale, \Lambda , MU ss 1015-1016 GeV : (7.7) Both estimates are very
   large compared to the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking. We are
   therefore assured that new physics must intervene at an energy of
   approximately 1 TeV, in order that the shifts in m not be much larger
   than v=p2. Only a few distinct scenarios for controlling the
   contribution of the integral in (7.5) can be envisaged. The
   supersymmetric solution16) is especially elegant. Exploiting the fact
   that fermion loops contribute with an overall minus sign (because of
   Fermi statistics), supersymmetry balances the contributions of fermion
   and boson loops. In the limit of unbroken supersymmetry, in which the
   masses of bosons are degenerate with those of their fermion
   counterparts, the cancellation is exact:X i= fermions+bosons Ci Z dk2 =
   0 : (7.8) If the supersymmetry is broken (as it must be in our world),
   the contribution of the integrals may still be acceptably small if the
   fermion-boson mass splittings \Delta M are not too large. The condition
   that g2\Delta M 2 be "small enough" leads to the requirement that
   superpartner masses be less than about 1 TeV=c2. A second solution to
   the problem of the enormous range of integration in (7.5) is offered by
   theories of dynamical symmetry breaking such as technicolor.17) In
   technicolor models, the Higgs boson is composite, and new physics
   arises on the scale of its binding, \Lambda T C ' O(1 TeV). Thus the
   effective range of integration is cut off, and mass shifts are under
   control. 9 hep-ph/9511438 FERMILAB-CONF-95/353-T A third possibility is
   that the gauge sector becomes strongly interacting.18) This would give
   rise to W W resonances, multiple production of gauge bosons, and other
   new phenomena at energies of 1 TeV or so. It is likely that a scalar
   bound state--a quasi-Higgs boson--would emerge with a mass less than
   about 1 TeV=c2. We cannot avoid the conclusion that some new physics
   must occur on the 1-TeV scale. This is the principal sharp motivation
   for multi-TeV hadron colliders--for the LHC. We seek to complete our
   understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking. A thorough
   investigation of the 1-TeV scale promises to solve the problem of
   gauge-boson masses and give us insight, if not a complete solution,
   into the origin of fermion masses. The large step in energy and
   sensitivity will also test the underpinnings of the standard model by
   allowing us to search for new forces, for composite quarks and leptons,
   and for new forms of matter. 8 Relevance Physics is possible because we
   can analyze phenomena on one energy scale without understanding all
   energy scales. In other words, we need not understand everything before
   we can begin to answer something. In quantum field theory, it is
   frequently possible to identify the relevant degrees of freedom on some
   energy scale, and to formulate effective field theories that make sense
   in a restricted domain. Decoupling theorems codify the statement that
   degrees of freedom that come into play on a high scale do not matter on
   a low scale. But the fact that we can formulate a consistent
   description of low-energy phenomena without understanding everything
   that happens all the way up to very high energies must not blind us to
   the additional insights that information from higher energies, or
   shorter distances, can bring. Early in this century, our scientific
   ancestors learned that to explain why a table is solid, or why a metal
   gleams, we must explore the atomic and molecular structure of matter at
   a billionth of human dimensions, where the laws of quantum mechanics
   take over from the customs of daily life. The recent discovery of the
   top quark in experiments at a billionth of the atomic scale inspires us
   to reconsider how the microworld influences our surroundings. It is
   popular to say that top quarks were created in great numbers in the
   early moments after the big bang some fifteen billion years ago,
   disintegrated in a fraction of a second, and vanished from the scene
   until my colleagues learned to create them in the Tevatron at Fermilab.
   That would be reason enough to be interested in top: to learn how it
   helped sow the seeds for the primordial universe that has evolved into
   the world of diversity and change we live in. But it is not the whole
   story; it invests the top quark with a remoteness that hides its real
   importance--and understates the immediacy of particle physics. The real
   wonder is that here and now, every minute of every day, top affects the
   world around us. I would like to close by giving one striking example
   of top's influence on the everyday.19) Consider a unified theory of the
   strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions--three-generation SU
   (5), say--in which all coupling constants take on a common value, ffU ,
   at some high energy, MU . If we adopt the point of view that the value
   of the coupling constant is fixed at the unification scale, then the
   value of the QCD scale parameter \Lambda QCD depends on the mass of the
   top quark. If we evolve the SU (3)c coupling, ffs, down from the
   unification scale in the spirit of Georgi, Quinn, and Weinberg,8) then
   the leading-logarithmic behavior is given by 1=ffs(Q) = 1=ffU + 216ss
   ln(Q=MU) ; (8.1) for MU ? Q ? mt. In the interval between mt and mb,
   the slope (33 \Gamma 2nf)=6ss (where nf is the number of active quark
   flavors) steepens to 23=6ss, and then increases by another 2=6ss at
   every quark threshold. At the boundary Q = Qn between effective field
   theories with n \Gamma 1 and n active flavors, the coupling constants
   ff(n\Gamma 1)s (Qn) and ff(n)s (Qn) must match. This behavior is shown
   by the solid line in Figure 3. 10 hep-ph/9511438 FERMILAB-CONF-95/353-T
   2 4 6 8 10 1/a s ln(Q) Figure 3: Two evolutions of the strong coupling
   constant. To discover the dependence of \Lambda QCD upon the top-quark
   mass, we use the one-loop evolution equation to calculate ffs(mt)
   starting from low energies and from the unification scale, and match:
   1=ffU + 216ss ln(mt=MU ) = 1=ffs(mc) \Gamma 256ss ln(mc=mb) \Gamma
   236ss ln(mb=mt) : (8.2) Identifying 1=ffs(mc) j 276ss ln(mc=\Lambda
   QCD) ; (8.3) we find that \Lambda QCD = e\Gamma 6ss=27ffU ` MU1 GeV '
   21=27 ` mtmbmc 1 GeV3 ' 2=27 GeV : (8.4) The scale parameter \Lambda
   QCD is the only dimensionful parameter in QCD; it determines the scale
   of the confinement energy that is the dominant contribution to the
   proton mass. We conclude that, in a simple unified theory, Mproton /
   m2=27t : (8.5) The dotted line in Figure 3 shows how the evolution of
   1=ffs changes if the top-quark mass is reduced. We see from Equations
   (8.4) and (8.5) that a factor-of-ten decrease in the top-quark mass
   would result in a 20% decrease in the proton mass. We can't fully
   understand the origin of one of the most important parameters in the
   everyday world--the mass of the proton--without knowing the properties
   of the top quark. Acknowledgements It is a pleasure to thank Jean and
