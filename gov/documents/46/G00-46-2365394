   PKI Business Case Analysis of Using PKI on Smart Cards

   This report was funded by the CIO Council and sponsored by the CIO
   Enterprise and Emerging IT Committee (EIEITC) as a model to assist
   agencies in evaluating and developing business cases for the use of
   these specific technologies to reinvent government. The report provides
   examples of the decision making process and provides cost modeling
   techniques, as well as case studies for a large and a small agency. The
   final report was presented to the PKI Business Working Group, the
   Federal PKI Steering Committee, and the EIEITC on April 18, 2001. It is
   expected to help agencies make key decisions on when and how to deploy
   PKI and smart card technologies.
