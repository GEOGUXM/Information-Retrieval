                     Information for Private Well Owners

     Groundwater Basics

     As a private well owner, it is important to recognize that you are
     responsible for ensuring the quantity and quality of your own water
     supply. A basic understanding of the nature and occurrence of
     groundwater, provided by materials found at the links below, can
     assist you in this quest.

     DWR provides basic information on groundwater in this eight-page
     fact sheet.

     The Groundwater Foundation web page provides basic information on
     groundwater hydrology and groundwater protection, as well as a
     useful glossary of terms. The National Ground Water Association
     offers information on groundwater occurrence and use.

     Groundwater occurs throughout California, in a number of different
     geologic settings. Much of the State's groundwater occurs in large
     alluvial basins. DWR's Bulletin 118 provides locations and
     information on the State's major groundwater basins.

     In rural areas, however, many well owners obtain their water supply
     from groundwater that occurs in fractured igneous, metamorphic, and
     sedimentary rocks. A DWR fact sheet provides information on the
     occurrence of groundwater in fractured rocks.

     The depth of groundwater fluctuates in response to natural seasonal
     and long-term fluctuations in recharge, as well as to manmade
     variations caused by pumping. DWR collects water level data,
     generally semi-annually, from numerous wells to document these
     changes. Water level information for your area may be available at
     DWR's Groundwater Level Home Page. In order to best use this
     information, you should understand the State Well Numbering System.

     Water Well Basics

     Although some groundwater users may be served by springs, the vast
     majority of users are served by a water well. The National Well
     Owners Association describes the construction and functioning of
     wells at its web page.

     Proper construction, maintenance and destruction of water wells is
     necessary to not only provide a reliable water supply, but also to
     protect the groundwater resource. Section 231 of the California
     Water Code requires DWR to develop well standards to protect
     groundwater quality. Common questions on the well standards are
     answered in Water Facts, Number 5. The National Ground Water
     Association discusses the problem of unused wells that are not
     properly destroyed.

     Most counties, and some cities have adopted ordinances to protect
     groundwater quality. These ordinances generally require permits to
     be issued before a well can be drilled or modified. You can find
     contact information for your local well permitting agency here.

     When a well is constructed, modified or destroyed, the law requires
     that the drilling contractor submit a Well Completion Report to DWR.
     As the well owner, you should obtain a copy of this report from your
     drilling contractor. If you don't have a copy of the well completion
     report for your well, it may be available in the files of one of
     DWR's District Offices.

     Proper maintenance of your well is needed to ensure long service and
     to help ensure that groundwater under your property is protected
     from contamination. California Groundwater Association, National
     Well Owners Association, and the National Ground Water Association
     offer tips for well maintenance.

     If it becomes necessary for you to deepen your existing well, drill
     a new well, or destroy a well on your property, there are some
     important things to know. The California Business and Professions
     Code requires that, "No person shall undertake to dig, bore, or
     drill a water well, cathodic protection well, groundwater monitoring
     well, or geothermal heat exchange well, to deepen or reperforate
     such a well, or to abandon or destroy such a well, unless the person
     responsible for that construction, alteration, destruction, or
     abandonment possesses a C-57 Water Well Contractor's License." The
     California Contractor's State License Board web page can be checked
     to find out whether a contractor is licensed and the status of a
     license, as well as providing information on hiring a contractor.

     The National Well Owners Association offers useful information on
     selecting a contractor and what to include in the contract.

     Water Quality

     While the quantity of water may be a well owners primary concern,
     water quality should be an ongoing concern as well. Unlike public
     water supplies, there is no state or federal agency that ensures the
     quality of water from an individual domestic well. The American
     Groundwater Trust offers recommendations for well testing and the
     National Well Owners Association offers general information on water
     quality, as well as specific information on radon, arsenic and
     bacteria.

     You may collect a sample on your own, or you may wish to hire a
     professional to conduct the sampling for you. In any case, the
     analysis should be conducted by a laboratory certified by the
     California Department of Health Services, which provides a list of
     certified laboratories.

     Once you have obtained analytical results from the laboratory, the
     standards that have been set for public water systems can be a
     useful reference for interpreting your own water quality. Maximum
     contaminant levels are set by the California Department of Health
     Services; there are national drinking water standards set by the
     U.S. EPA as well.

     If you have a water quality problem with your well, it may be
     possible to treat the water to improve its quality. High bacterial
     concentrations may be controlled by disinfecting the well. High
     concentrations of inorganic and organic compounds may be treated
     with a number of devices. DHS offers a listing of certified
     treatment devices.

     DWR's District Offices, or e-mail Carl Hauge, DWR's Chief
     Hydrogeologist.
