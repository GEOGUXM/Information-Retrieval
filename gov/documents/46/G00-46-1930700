   Privacy Statement
     __________________________________________________________________


   You are entering the FirstGov for Employers Web site, an official
   United States Government System which may be used only for authorized
   purposes. Thank you for visiting us. FirstGov for Employers is
   committed to protecting the privacy rights of America's taxpayers.
   These rights are ensured through the Internal Revenue Code, the Privacy
   Act, other federal statutes, and FirstGov for Employers policies and
   practices. We will not collect personal information about you just
   because you visit this site.

   FirstGov for Employers does not use "cookies," a file placed on a
   visitor's hard drive that allows the Web site to monitor the
   individual's use of the site. No attempts are made to identify
   individual users unless illegal behavior is suspected. We monitor
   network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change
   information or otherwise cause damage to the Web service. We focus on
   Web site security so that this service remains available to you and
   other visitors.

   In order to improve the usefulness of our Web site for our visitors, we
   automatically collect and maintain statistical information from our
   site's data logs that concern network traffic flow and volume. This
   information consists of data such as:

    1. the name of the domain from which the visitor accesses the Internet
       (e.g., "a company.com"; "a school.edu"; or "an agency.gov");
    2. the Internet Protocol Number; and
    3. the date and time the FirstGov for Employers Web site is visited.

   This information does not identify individual visitors. It is retained
   for a minimum of 90 days to comply with National Archives and Records
   Administration requirements.

   If you would like to ask us a question during your visit, please send a
   message to the STAWRS Webmaster, as noted at the bottom of the screen.
   We will answer you directly or by forwarding your request to another
   office that is better able to respond to your question. Please be aware
   that the confidentiality of Internet transmissions is not guaranteed.
   It is up to you if you want to assume the risk of an unauthorized
   person learning your e-mail address or any other personal information
   you provide. As part of our response to you, FirstGov for Employers
   will not e-mail personal information such as account-related or refund
   information.

   We will not share the information you give us with anyone unless
   required by law. We also will not collect or sell your information for
   commercial purposes.

   The Government may monitor and audit usage of this system and all
   persons are hereby notified that use of this system constitutes consent
   to such monitoring and auditing. Unauthorized attempts to upload
   information and/or change information on this Web site are strictly
   prohibited and are subject to prosecution under the Computer Fraud and
   Abuse Act of 1986 and Title 18 U.S.C. Sec.1001 and 1030.
