Ebook FAQ


     * netLibrary Ebooks are available through an AccessMichigan program
       called MEL Ebooks.
     * Only one person can view a book at a time.  If the book you are
       browsing is requested by another patron, reading time is limited to
       20 minutes.  You may also "check out" the book for 6 hours.
     * Small sections of the book can be printed, but not the whole book.
     * You read the book on your computer.  A "Reader" is only required if
       you are downloading the book to your home computer.
     * The books are primarily non-fiction.  You can do keyword searches
       of the entire book or browse the table of contents.
     * If you want to access Ebooks from home, you must first create a
       netLibrary account from a Kalamazoo Public Library computer.
       Follow the on-screen directions on the netLibrary homepage to
       create your account. After you have registered at netLibrary, you
       can access the Ebooks from anywhere you have Internet access.
     * You may checkout and "download" a book to your home computer.  This
       allows you to read the book offline.  To download a book, you must
       first download the Reader.  The reader is free software that
       handles the display and return book.   The book is "returned" after
       6 hours.

          If you have any questions, please contact library staff.
