   DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

   PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE

   National Toxicology Program (NTP), National Institute of Environmental
   Health Sciences (NIEHS), Center for the Evaluation of Risks to Human
   Reproduction (CERHR), announces:

   (1) Availability of the Draft Expert Panel Reports on 1- Bromopropane
   and 2-Bromopropane - Public comments are solicited on these draft
   reports and the deadline for written comments is November 23, 2001.

   (2) Bromopropane Expert Panel Meeting scheduled for December 5-7, 2001
   - The meeting is open to the public and will be held at the Hilton
   Washington-Dulles Airport Hotel, Herndon, VA.

   The NTP and the NIEHS established the NTP CERHR [Federal Register,
   December 14, 1998 (Volume 63, Number 239, page 68782)] in June 1998.
   The purpose of the Center is to provide scientifically-based, uniform
   assessments of the potential for adverse effects on reproduction and
   development caused by agents to which humans may be exposed. Expert
   panels conduct scientific evaluations of agents selected by the Center
   in public forums. Additional details about CERHR are provided below
   (see Additional Information about CERHR evaluations).

   The agents currently under evaluation are 1-bromopropane (CASRN:
   106-94-5) and 2-bromopropane (CASRN: 75-26-3). 1-Bromopropane is used
   as a cleaning solvent; as a solvent vehicle in spray adhesives; as a
   solvent for fats, waxes, or resins; and as an intermediate in the
   synthesis of other compounds. 2-Bromopropane is used in the synthesis
   of pharmaceuticals, dyes, and other compounds and is present as a
   contaminant in 1- bromopropane. Bromopropanes are being considered as
   replacement chemicals for ozone-depleting chemicals such as
   hydrochlorofluorocarbons and chlorinated solvents. The scientific
   database on these chemicals includes studies on neurotoxicity,
   reproductive toxicity, and occupational exposures. 2-Bromopropane is
   reported to be a reproductive toxicant in humans.

   The Draft Expert Panel Report is composed of the following sections:

   1.0 Chemistry, Use, and Human Exposure

   Post-Meeting Public Comments

   Following the Bromopropane Expert Panel Meeting and completion of the
   Expert Panel Report, public comment will be solicited. This
   solicitation will be announced in a future Federal Register notice.

   For other questions about the Draft Report on 1-Bromopropane and
   2-Bromopropane or the Bromopropane Expert Panel Meeting, contact the
   CERHR Director [contact information provided above].

   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT CERHR EVALUATIONS

   CERHR invites the nomination of agents for review or scientists for its
   expert registry. Information about CERHR and the nomination process can
   be obtained from its homepage (http://cerhr.niehs.nih.gov) or by
   contacting the Center Director (contact information provided above).
   The Center selects chemicals for evaluation based upon several factors
   including production volume, extent of human exposure, public concern,
   and published evidence of reproductive or developmental toxicity.

   CERHR follows a formal, multi-step process for review and evaluation of
   selected chemicals. The formal evaluation process is outlined in the
   Federal Register notice July 16, 2001 (Volume 66, Number 136, pages
   37047-37048) and on the CERHR web site under "About CERHR". Briefly,
   the Center establishes an expert panel to review and evaluate the
   scientific evidence on the selected chemical(s), to receive public
   comments, and to prepare a report on the chemical(s). This draft expert
   panel report is made publicly available for comment, both through the
   CERHR web site and upon request from CERHR, and an expert panel meeting
   is held to discuss and evaluate the draft report. Following the expert
   panel meeting and completion of the expert panel report, public comment
   is solicited again. After this public comment period ends, the NTP
   staff prepares a NTP center report on the evaluated chemical(s) that
   integrates background information on the chemical(s), findings of the
   expert panel, and a discussion of any additional, recent studies. The
   NTP center report includes all public comments received on the expert
   panel report. The final NTP center report is made publicly available
   and distributed to interested stakeholders and to appropriate
   regulatory, health, and research agencies.
