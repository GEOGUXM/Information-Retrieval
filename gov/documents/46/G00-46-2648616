   CASE SCHEDULED FOR ORAL ARGUMENT ON FEBRUARY 26 & 27, 2000 IN THE
   UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT No.
   00-5212 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. MICROSOFT
   CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellant No. 00-5213 STATE OF NEW YORK, EX REL.
   ATTORNEY GENERAL ELIOT SPITZER ET AL., Plaintiffs-Appellees v.
   MICROSOFT CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellant APPELLEES' MOTION FOR
   ENLARGEMENT OF TIME TO FILE CD-ROM The Court's Orders of October 11 and
   November 3, 2000 provide for appellees to file the CD-ROM versions of
   our brief today. Due to technical problems at the vendor beyond
   appellees' control, however, the CD-ROM is not ready. Thus, appellees
   respectfully request an extension until January 22, 2001, to file the
   CD-ROMs. We are authorized by counsel to state that appellant Microsoft
   Corporation does not object to this motion. Pursuant to the Court's
   encouragement in its October 11 Order, the parties have cooperated by
   using one vendor, realLegal.com, to produce all CD-ROM versions of the
   parties' briefs in this case. Despite appellees best efforts in
   providing the needed materials to realLegal in a timely manner, and
   having an attorney and legal assistant in Denver (where realLegal's
   offices are located) since Monday, January 15, to work with them in
   finalizing the CD-ROM, realLegal has not completed its work. RealLegal
   currently expects to complete the CD-ROM today, which would permit
   government counsel to transport it to Washington overnight, for filing
   tomorrow, January 19. Because the CD-ROM has not yet been completed,
   however, we believe it prudent to request that the deadline be extended
   until Monday, January 22, although we will make every effort to file it
   earlier. CONCLUSION The Court should grant an extension to January 22,
   2001, for appellees to file the CD- ROM. Respectfully submitted. ELIOT
