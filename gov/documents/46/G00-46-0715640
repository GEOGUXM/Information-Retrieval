   Since 1900 the USGS has provided water-resources data and information
   about Michigan. Historical information about streamflow, ground-water
   levels, and water quality provide a baseline to assess the effects of
   human activities and natural changes, such as climate, on water
   resources. Nearly every question asked about water resources in
   Michigan requires information from long-term monitoring networks. USGS
   products provide policy makers, managers, scientists, and the general
   public with information needed to understand and make sound decisions
   regarding Michigan's natural resources.

   Today the Michigan District continues to run monitoring networks and
   conduct scientific assessments and research of Michigan's water
   resources. We do this with a highly trained staff of hydrologists and
   hydrologic technicians who have education and expertise in the fields
   of geology, engineering, hydrogeology, statistics, biology,
   microbiology, chemistry, and geography. These scientists are supported
   by a computer unit (which is bringing you these web pages) and an
   administrative unit. The District has about 45 people in our Lansing
   District Office, 6 in our Grayling Field Office, and 7 in our Escanaba
   Field Office.

   Most of the monitoring, interpretive work, and research in the Michigan
   District is cooperatively funded through the USGS Federal-State
   Cooperative Program. The Cooperative Program allows the USGS to match
   up to 50 percent of project costs with state and local agencies. In
   Michigan, we typically have about 50 cooperators with whom we are
   working. About 80 percent of our District funding is through the
   Cooperative Program. About 95 percent of our statewide monitoring is
   funded through this program.

   In addition to our Cooperative Program projects and monitoring, the
   USGS wholely funds some monitoring of surface, ground water, and water
   quality. The National Water Quality Assessment Program also provides
   interpretive information about water resources in southeast Michigan
   and part of the Upper Peninsula. Also, some Federal Agencies fund the
   USGS to conduct monitoring, assessment, and research.

   Our goal is that results of our work will be timely, of high quality,
   relevant, and valued by our cooperators and the public. These web pages
   are one means of achieving this goal. Our web pages include a
   searchable index of our publications, descriptions of recently
   completed and ongoing programs and projects, and access to our
   monitoring data. If you have any comments or suggestions on how the
   pages could be improved to better serve your needs, please contact the
   Michigan District Webmaster.
