   Example of the relocation algorithm

   These are the storm track stats for convection change with a relocation
   that was only correcting to the within 15 km. EXP2 is the test package
   results

   tropical storm track verification for 1999 compared with other
   operational center results

   The following gif file shows the comparison of the experimental runs
   with the operational AVN runs. (EXP1 convection change with a
   relocation that is to the nearest degree lat/long point, EXP2
   convection change and relocation to the nearest 15 km)

   tropical storm track verification for 1999

   The following two figures are precipitation scores for U.S. for the
   convection test. For these scores, PRY stood for the experimental
   convection runs.

   T126 Precip threat score for August 1999

   T126 Precip bias score for August 1999

   Following are a set of month long assimilation and forecast results
   using T62 system to test tropical climate response to convection
   change. prq is the designated name for the experimental runs while pra
   is the control.
