   Department of Energy Vision 21 Program Plan Clean Energy Plants for the
   21st Century A Message to Our Stakeholders As the 20th century rapidly
   draws to a close, the power and fuels research and development commu-
   nity faces a major challenge: to protect the environment while
   producing a plentiful supply of clean low- cost energy that is
   essential to maintaining our economic prosperity. We know we will need
   to depend on fossil fuels for a major share of our electricity and
   transportation fuels needs well into the 21st century, especially
   globally. We also believe it makes good sense to rely not on any single
   energy resource, but rather on a diverse fuel mix that includes coal,
   gas, oil, nuclear, biomass and other renewables, and "opportunity"
   resources. The solution lies in developing substantially improved clean
   and low-cost technology. By taking the lead now and focusing our
   efforts, we can develop the technol- ogy to meet the energy and
   environmental challenges we face and ensure our continuing economic
   growth. This document is the draft Program Plan for "Vision 21 - Clean
   Energy Plants for the 21st Century." It describes what Vision 21 is,
   sets performance targets for Vision 21 plants, explains how Vision 21
   interfaces with and relates to our current power and fuels R&D program,
   and describes the Vision 21 program elements and activities. A
   preliminary Roadmap is provided at the end of the Plan. Much of what is
   in this Vision 21 Program Plan has come from you, our stakeholders,
   including what you shared with us at the Vision 21 Workshop held in
   Pittsburgh in December, 1998. Additional gov- ernment-industry
   roadmapping workshops are planned for the future that will focus on
   intermediate program steps and milestones. We need a program with
   aggressive but sensible objectives, that is balanced, but gives the
   appropriate emphasis to the various program elements and activities. We
   need to respond to key public needs , especially a clean environment,
   and also to market needs if industry is to build Vision 21 plants in
   the deregulated, cost-driven arena. Only with your involvement and
   support can we succeed. Achieving our goals will not be easy. A
   cooperative partnership of industry, academia, and government will have
   the best chance of succeeding. We welcome your comments and suggestions
   about the plan. Please respond directly to us or to the contacts listed

   PLANTS" Materials: Higher-strength, corrosion-resistant, and more
   durable materials will be needed for the 21st Century Energy Plants.
   Improved ceramics also will be necessary for the high- temperature
   membranes needed for gas separation. Catalysts and Sorbents: R&D will
   be necessary to further improve the effectiveness of catalysts that can
   lower the costs of coal conversion and sorbents that can remove
   pollutants from hot gas streams exiting a coal gasifier or combustor.
   Instrumentation: To attain peak efficiency, future 21st Century Energy
   Plant operators will have to fine-tune plant operations to accommodate
   variations in fuel feedstocks and other variable conditions in plant
   operations. The use of artificial intelligence and new sensor
   technology to control plant operations will be a key R&D effort.
   "Virtual" Plants: To minimize the cost of progressively larger test
   facilities, 21st Century Energy Plants will rely on new computer
   simulation technologies to test processes and verify engineering
   performance. R&D will be needed to develop advanced computational
   techniques similar to those used today to design commercial airplanes
   or to simulate nuclear explosions. Carbon Sequestration: If the 21st
   Century Energy Plant concept can be coupled with low-cost carbon
   sequestration (the capturing and permanent storage of carbon dioxide
   and other green- house gases), the result would be a future energy
   facility with virtually no environmental impact outside of its
