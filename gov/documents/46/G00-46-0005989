                             Farm Usage by BTeV

   This page gives uptodate statistics of the CD Farms by BTeV. The Usage
   is currently mainly for simulation work and involves running a GEANT
   version of the proposed BTeV detector.

   Plots are shown for total jobs run versus date and the number of jobs
   run per day. Also shown are the number of Monte Carlo events processed
   versus date. Since both the number of runs and the number of events
   processed depend on what exactly is run, also given is the CPU time
   used (total and per day), and the per day usage is shown as a
   percentage of the total farm CPU time allocated to BTeV.
