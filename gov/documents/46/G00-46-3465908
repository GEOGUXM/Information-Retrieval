                                              I BONDS TO EARN 4.40%
                                WHEN BOUGHT FROM NOVEMBER 2001 THROUGH APRIL 2002

                     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
                     November 1, 2001

                                           I BOND EARNINGS RATE: 4.40%

                     The earnings rate for I Bonds is a combination of a fixed rate, which
   will apply for the life of the bond, and the inflation rate. The 4.40
   percent earnings rate for I Bonds bought from November 2001 through
   April 2002 will apply for the first six months after their issue. The
   earnings rate combines the 2.00 percent fixed rate of return with the
   2.38 percent annualized rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer
   Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U). The CPI-U increased from
   176.2 to 178.3 from March 2001 to September 2001, a six-month increase
   of 1.19 percent.

   Treasurys inflation-indexed I Bonds are designed to offer all Americans
   a way to save that protects the purchasing power of their investment by
   assuring them a real rate of return over and above inflation. I Bonds
   have features that make them attractive to many investors. They are
   sold at face value in denominations of $50, $75, $100, $200, $500,
   $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000 and earn interest for as long as 30 years.
   I Bond earnings are added every month and interest is compounded
   semiannually. They are State and local income tax exempt, and Federal
   income tax on I Bond earnings can be deferred until the bonds are
   cashed or they stop earning interest after 30 years. Investors cashing
   I Bonds before five years are subject to a 3-month earnings penalty.

                           I BOND FIXED RATE 2.00%

   Series I, inflation-indexed savings bonds purchased from November 2001
   through April 2002 will earn a 2.00 percent fixed rate of return over
   and above inflation. The 2.0 percent fixed rate applies for the 30-year
   life of I Bonds purchased during this six-month period.
