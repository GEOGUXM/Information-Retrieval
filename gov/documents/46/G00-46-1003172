             Geosynthetic Reinforced Soil (GRS) Bridge Abutment.

     Background


     During the 1970's, a series of FHWA studies determined that various
     segments within the field of highway geotechnology needed
     significant improvement in design and construction applications.
     This was especially important considering that bridge foundations,
     retaining wall systems, embankments, and cut-slope operations
     account for well over 50 percent of the total cost of most highway
     projects. It was therefore imperative that accurate and rational
     guidelines be developed for geotechnical-related design and
     construction applications to ensure safe and efficient highway
     structures. Also, at this time, there was a significant influx of
     innovative geotechnical methods to retain earth masses and/or
     improve ground materials to withstand heavy loads.

     As a result of these discoveries, FHWA expanded the Geotechnical
     Research Program to address many of these needs. The program was
     divided into three main projects :
     * Soil Behavior
     * Foundations
     * Ground Improvement

     During the 1990's, the soil behavior project was completed, and the
     other two were revised to reflect the accomplishments in each
     project plus the objectives still to be achieved.
