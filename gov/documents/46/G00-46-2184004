                 Linder Ranked As One of President’s

                           Top Supporters in 2001


   WASHINGTON, D.C.
   — Congressman John Linder (R-Georgia) was pleased to announce today
   that he has been ranked by Congressional Quarterly magazine as one of
   the strongest supporters of President Bush’s legislative agenda in
   2001. Linder voted 98% of the time in support of the President’s
   positions on issues ranging from an economic stimulus package to a
   comprehensive energy policy.

   “I am very pleased to be able to say that I had the strongest record in
   supporting the President in the Georgia delegation—and the fifth
   strongest in the entire U.S. House of Representatives,” Linder said. “I
   will continue to stand behind all sound legislation that the President
   proposes, whether it is holding terrorists accountable or promoting tax
   cuts for American workers.”

   CQ’s
   annual voting studies, released in the January 12, 2002, edition of “CQ
   Weekly,” show that of the 120 votes on which President Bush staked out
   a clear position during 2001, he got his way all but 16 times. That 87
   percent success rate is the best since 1965, when Lyndon B. Johnson won
   93 percent of the votes he asked for.
