   [cy_ball.gif] Predictions and their automatic evaluation data
   A December 1996 meeting was a culmination of a 9 month long, community
   wide experiment in objective testing of the structure prediction
   methods. Before the meeting, 42 structural targets provided by
   crystallographers and NMR spectroscopists were made available to the
   prediction community. For the first time targets in the docking
   category were included in addition to those in comparative modeling,
   fold recognition, and ab initio folding. Prior to the public release of
   structures, more than 900 predictions by approximately 70 research
   groups world wide were collected.

   Verification of the prediction targets, the submission formats, and the
   development of software for the automatic evaluation of predictions was
   done by Aron Marchler-Bauer, NLM, Ceslovas Venclovas and Adam Zemla,
   Protein Structure Prediction Center.

   Independent assessors this time were Janet Thornton, University
   College, London, for comparative modeling, Michael Levitt, Stanford
   University, for fold recognition, and Arthur Lesk, University of
   Cambridge Clinical School, for ab initio predictions. The assessments
   will be published in an upcoming issue of PROTEINS.
