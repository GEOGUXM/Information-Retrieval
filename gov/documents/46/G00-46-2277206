   Amended Official Bankruptcy
   Form 7, Statement of Financial Affairs Eva Culwell, Chief Deputy
                                                                    01/04/2001

   The Judicial Conference, at its September 2000 session, approved
   amendments to Official Bankruptcy Form 7, the Statement of Financial
   Affairs. This form must be completed by the debtor in every bankruptcy
   case.

   The form has been amended to provide additional information requested
   by taxing authorities, pension fund supervisors, and governmental units
   charged with environmental protection and regulation. Four new
   questions have been added to the form. The new questions concern:
     * community property owned by the debtor and the debtor's non-filing
       spouse or former spouse (Question 16),
     * environmental information (Question 17),
     * any consolidated tax group of a corporate debtor (Question 24), and
     * the debtor's contributions to any employee pension fund (Question
       25).

   In addition, every corporate or partnership debtor and every individual
   or joint debtor who has been in business within six years before filing
   the petition must answer Questions 19-25. This is an enlargement of the
   two-year period previously specified. The instructions contained in the
   form also have been amended to make it clear that individual or joint
   debtors who have not been in business, as defined in the form, within
   the six years prior to filing should not answer Questions 19 through 25
   but proceed directly to the signature page of the form.

   The amended form is available on the Internet at
   http://www.uscourts.gov/bankform or from http://www.uscourts.gov. Click
   on For Public Review, scroll down and click on Federal Rulemaking, then
   click on Official Bankruptcy Forms.

   The amended form is effective now but bankruptcy forms publishers and
   software vendors will require a reasonable time to produce and
   distribute the new version. Until the new form becomes widely
   available, bankruptcy case trustees and creditors who need the
   additional information required by the form must request the debtor to
   furnish it separately, either at the meeting of creditors or by other
   means.
