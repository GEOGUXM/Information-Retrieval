   Applying Scientific Knowledge to Current Problems   [ Regional
   Assessment Home ]

   [flood.gif] While much of the research conducted by NASA has long-term
   goals, the data collected can also be applied to help solve near-term
   problems. Recently, the GHCC initiated an effort to apply NASA remote
   sensing data and technologies to regional assessments and issues of
   local and regional concern. These include the vulnerability to climate
   change and the evaluation of the potential social, economic, and human
   effects on agriculture, forests, fisheries, local natural ecosystems,
   and water resources. The GHCC is participating in a major national
   effort to assess the implications of climate variability and change on
   major economic sectors such as agriculture, forests, water resources,
   coastal areas, and human health. This assessment, which is coordinated
   by the President's Office of Science and Technology Policy, will
   produce the first national climate impacts assessment by the end of
   1999. To assist this process, the GHCC is developing strategic
   partnerships with universities; regional planning, agricultural, and
   environmental organizations; power companies; city, county, and state
   governments, and private industry. Through these we hope to develop
   sensible applications of remote sensing technologies to a broad
   spectrum of problems, ranging from short-term climatological effects on
   agricultural yields to long-term environmentally sound sustainable
   development plans for metropolitan areas, especially the management of
   regional water resources.

   [souteast.gif] The American Southeast is a focal point of this effort,
   because the area experiences many climate extremes that affect the
   economics of a region that still depends heavily on agriculture. The
   primary focus of the GHCC is to understand the Earth's global water
   cycle, the distribution and variability of atmospheric water, and the
   impact of human activity as it relates to global climate change. From
   there, we can educate society about the global hydrological process and
   their impact on society.

   A key GHCC function is to bring scientific research results to bear on
   regional decision-making processes. Working with the Southern Growth
   Policies Board (representing the governors of 14 southern states, a
   number of state economic development agencies, southeastern power
   companies, and several cities), the GHCC is helping to develop new
   markets for remote sensing technologies and data to improve the quality
   of life and regional economic development. In 1997, the GHCC formed a
   Synthesis Team--consisting of representatives of other federal agencies
   and university researchers--to set guidelines and develop an
   integration strategy with people involved, including stakeholders who
   have direct interests in the issues. In 1998, the GHCC will integrate
   stakeholder inputs into a regional assessment and use the information
   in education and outreach programs. The results of this southeastern
   regional assessment will be fully integrated into the national impacts
   report.
