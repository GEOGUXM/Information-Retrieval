  Ultraspectral Imaging, Imaging Spectrometry, Hyperspectral Imaging, Imaging
  Spectroscopy

   Imaging spectroscopy has many names in the remote sensing community,
   including imaging spectrometry, hyperspectral, and ultraspectral
   imaging. Spectroscopy is the study of electromagnetic radiation.
   Spectrometry is derived from spectro-photometry, the measure of photons
   as a function of wavelength, a term used for years in astronomy.
   However, spectrometry is becoming a term used to indicate the
   measurement of non-light quantities, such as in mass spectrometry (e.g.
   Ball, 1995). Hyper means excessive, but no imaging spectrometer in use
   can hardly be considered hyper-spectral, after all, a couple of hundred
   channels pales in comparison to truly high resolution spectrometer with
   millions of channels. Ultraspectral is beyond hyperspectral, a lofty
   goal that has not yet been reached. Terms like laboratory spectrometer,
   spectroscopist, reflectance spectroscopy, thermal emission
   spectroscopy, etc, are in common use. One rarely, if ever sees the
   converse: spectrometrist, reflectance spectrometry, etc. So it seems
   prudent to keep the terminology consistent with "imaging spectroscopy."

   Lab are studying and applying methods for identifying and mapping
   materials through spectroscopic remote sensing (called imaging
   spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging, imaging spectrometry,
   ultraspectral imaging, etc), on the earth and throughout the solar
   system using laboratory, airborne and spacecraft spectrometers.

   The image shown here is a mineral map, where each color is the
   identification of specific minerals through imaging spectroscopy
   analysis. See Material Maps and Spectral Libraries
