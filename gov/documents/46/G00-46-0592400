   lightweight inflatable antenna A group of Los Angelesarea college
   students recently worked alongside JPL engineers to demonstrate
   components of a prototype antenna that would weigh about one-tenth as
   much as the main antennas on current interplanetary spacecraft. The
   booms to support the flat-sheet antenna are made of ultralight
   materials resembling aluminum foil. The entire structure can be stored
   as a rolled-up cylinder, then unfurled into an antenna membrane 3
   meters (10 feet) wide. One engineering challenge has been to keep the
   structure rigid after its initial inflation, so that the antenna
   surface remains taut without continued air pressure. In space, it would
   have to stay deployed long after the active flow of air stops and
   micrometeorites punch pinholes in the inflated components. Principal
