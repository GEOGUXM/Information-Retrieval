[geo2zt.gif] Global warming

   So is it getting warmer or what?
          The most authoritative report on this issue is Climate Change
          1995: IPCC Second Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental
          Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is part of the United
          Nations Environmental Programme. The IPCC has a large amount of
          information on their web site dealing with this topic.

   Other good sources of information on global warming include:
          U.S. EPA's Global Warming website
          Woods Hole Research Center's Global Warming Page

   Does the USGS monitor global warming?
          Not specifically. Our charge is to understand characteristics of
          the earth, especially the earth's surface, that affect our
          Nation's land, water, and biological resources. That includes
          quite a bit of environmental monitoring but other agencies,
          especially NOAA and NASA, are specifically funded to monitor
          global temperature and atmospheric phenomena such as ozone
          concentrations. Our work at USGS in the Global Change and
          Climate History Program focuses on understanding the likely
          consequences of climate change, especially by studying how
          climate has changed in the past.

[geo2zt.gif] General WWW issues

   What are some good places to look for geoscience information?
          The temptation is to look at search engines, and they can often
          return good information about computer technology. But for
          scientific information there's no good substitute for human
          discovery and review. Especially of interest is the
          carefully-prepared work of Eric Fookes and Christophe Nussbaum
          at the University of Geneva, Switzerland. Their site is Links to
          Great Earth-Science Resources. You may also want to look at the
          Websurfer's Earth Science Review's Earth Science Hotlinks.

[geo2zt.gif] Oceanography

   Where can I get current sea-surface temperature data?
          The data on GeoChange are no newer than 1991. More comprehensive
          data are available at the Physical Oceanography Distributed
          Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC) at JPL in Pasadena. For specific
          data covering coastal areas, consult the NOAA CoastWatch Program
          or its data access system, the NOAA CoastWatch Archive and
          Access System (NCAAS). Some overview information on CoastWatch
          is available here.

   Where can I get more sea-surface temperature data?
          The best place for this information is the Physical Oceanography
          Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC) at the Jet
          Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. This DAAC keeps
          and distributes all of the AVHRR-derived SST data collected as
          part of NASA's EOSDIS. Here's the latest info from Sue Digby:

     AVHRR weekly global 18km gridded MCSST (Miami), (Product 016)

     Data has been added so coverage extends from 1981 through the second
     quarter of 1996.
     The AVHRR MCSST data set contains weekly averaged multichannel
     sea-surface temperatures (MCSSTs) derived from the NOAA Advanced
     High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The data is available as a
     global set (2048 x 1024 pixels) in HDF via FTP (ftp
     podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/pub). The data, prepared by the University of
     Miami/Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (RSMAS),
     have a resolution of approximately 18 km by 18 km at the equator and
     are presented on an equal angle grid. DN values can be used to
     derive the actual Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in degrees Celsius.
     The data can also be provided on 8mm tape.
     MCSST SUBSETTING ON THE WEB
     Subsets of the data are also available using a subsetting routine
     accessible on the WWW:

[geo2zt.gif] Weather and climate data

   Where can I find the temperature or precipitation for YourCity, USA?
          The best place for this sort of information is the National
          Climatic Data Center, which is part of the National Oceanic and
          Atmospheric Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce.
          The NCDC is physically located in Asheville, North Carolina.
          Their web address is http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/. They have a wide
          variety of online data available for immediate download, and
          they also have more extensive data on media like CD-ROM and tape
          (you generally have to pay for the cost of the media for those).
          I have always found their staff quite helpful.
