     damage to it or to any Office of Thrift Supervision electronic
     facility or data through the knowing transmission of any program,
     information, code, or command is unlawful. For site security
     purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all
     users, this government computer system employs software programs to
     monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload
     or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Except for
     authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are
     made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Access to
     or use of this Web site constitutes consent to these terms.

Privacy Policy for OTS Web Site

     The OTS respects your privacy. We do not collect or store
     information about members of the public who call or write the agency
     or visit our Web site, unless you identify yourself so that we can
     respond to an inquiry or request from you.

     We do, however, collect and store information about your Internet
     connection when you visit our Web site to read or download
     information, such as our bulletins, alerts, or press releases. We
     use this information to help stay abreast of technical upgrades that
     can make our site more accessible to visitors and to record the date
     and time of your visit to our site.

     If you identify yourself when you contact us, various people may see
     your information. We adhere to the following principles in handling
     information you provide:
     * We use your personally identifying information only for the purpose
       for which it is originally collected.
     * We maintain your personally identifying information in secure
       computer systems and we limit employee access to those with a
       business reason to see it.
     * We do not disclose your information to anyone outside the OTS,
       except where compelled by law or in connection with a criminal
       investigation (as explained below).

     To understand in greater detail how we handle your Internet
     connection and personal identification information, read the
     sections below.
       _______________________________________________________________

     When visiting the OTS Web site: If you visit our site to read or
     download information, we do not collect information about you, but
     we do collect and store information about your Internet connection.
     Specifically, we record:
     * The name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for
       example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online
       account, or princeton.edu, if you are connecting from Princeton
       University's domain).
     * The Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly
       to our site, if any (for example, www.fdic.gov, if you are
       following a link from the FDIC Web site, or www.yahoo.com, if you
       find us using the Yahoo search engine).
     * The type of web browsing software and operating system you are
       using to view our site.
     * The date and time you access our site.
     * The pages you visit on our site

     When calling or sending postal or electronic mail: You may choose to
     tell us your name and address or other identifying information when,
     for example, you submit a complaint or an inquiry or comment that
     requires further correspondence.
     * If you make an inquiry or request to be added to a mailing list, we
       enter your information into one of our electronic databases that
       are used for mailing lists and for tracking correspondence.
     * If you respond to a request for public comments on proposed
       rulemakings, policy statements or other regulatory actions, a copy
       of your comment letter is placed in the public file and is
       available to the general public.

     If you are sending electronic mail to the OTS, we want to remind you
     that e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. If your
     information is very sensitive, or includes personal or confidential
     information -- such as your bank account, charge card, or social
     security number -- you may want to send it by postal mail to one of
     the addresses listed below.

     When making an inquiry, request, or complaint that requires
     follow-up: If you are making an inquiry or request or filing a
     complaint that warrants supervisory or other attention, we may need
     to share your information with others.
     * We may need to bring your correspondence to the attention of our
       attorneys, examiners, or other appropriate staff.
     * If necessary to address the issue, we may need to share your
       correspondence with other federal, state, or local agencies
       responsible for administrating or enforcing laws, rules, or
       regulations or for investigating known or suspected violations of
       laws, rules, or regulations, such as the Justice Department.
     * Under limited circumstances, such as a request from Congress or a
       private individual acting with appropriate legal authority, we may
       be required by law to disclose information you submit.
     * If you file a complaint about a savings association or its
       affiliate, we typically provide your customer identification
       information along with the complaint to the affected savings
       association. This information is usually necessary for the savings
       association to be able to investigate and correct a problem. In
       turn, a savings association sometimes provides the OTS additional
       information about you when it responds to our inquiry. All of this
       information is securely retained in OTS records.

     If you do not want your identity disclosed to the savings
     association, it may be difficult to resolve your problem, but we
     will make every effort to assist you. Please state this clearly in
     your complaint, and submit your complaint to us in writing.

     To report a problem with a thrift or to contact our Consumer
     Complaints Department:

     confidential information -- such as your savings account, charge
