   SNfactory Spectrophotometry Requirements Document v0.2 Greg Aldering
   Dec 4, 2000 1 Introduction The baseline requirement for
   spectrophotometry for the SNfactory is an internally consistent
   extra-atmospheric flux calibration with systematic accuracy better than
   1% under photometric conditions and better than 3% under
   non-photometric conditions. A knowledge of the flux calibration error
   on an internally consistent system is also required. A derived
   requirement is knowledge of whether conditions are photometric or
   non-photometric. The flux calibration systematics requirements apply
   over the spectral range where the total system throughput is greater
   than 20% of peak (,3500-10500*A), with the exception of the sharp
   atmospheric O2 bands (6900*A and 7600*A). The components necessary to
   determine the flux calibration include: t = time * = wavelength X =
   airmass k(*; t; X) = atmospheric extinction; as a function of *; t; X:
   OE(*; t) = telescope throughput; as a function of *; t: ,(*; t) =
   instrument throughput; as a function of *; t: D(*; t) = detector
   quantum efficiency; as a function of *; t: S(*) = intrinsic standard
   star spectrum; as a function of *: s(*; t; X) = observed standard star
   spectrum; as a function of *; t; X: F (*) = intrinsic field star
   spectrum; as a function of *: f (*; t; X) = observed field star
   spectrum; as a function of *; t; X: S(*) is given by published
   spectrophotometry of standard stars. It is possible that these
   published results contain systematic errors which exceed the desired
   SNfactory spectrophotometry absolute calibration budget. At this stage
   nothing can be done about this, thus only an internally consistent
   calibration budget is specified. Atmospheric extinction can be
   decomposed into contributions from Rayleigh scattering, aerosol
   scattering, ozone absorption, molecular oxygen absorption, water
   absorption, and water scattering. None of these components can be
   considered constant, but a great deal is known about the typical
   spectral and temporal behavior of these components from calculations
   and monitoring. According to the GONG site survey (Hill, et al.1994),
   the extinction at Mauna Kea is among the lowest and most stable of any
   astronomical site. The average optical extinction 1 Figure 1: The
   extinction, in magnitudes per airmass, typical of Mauna Kea. on clear
   days is 0.074, with a dispersion of only 0.015. The power spectrum of
   transmission variations measured by GONG during clear days follows the
   relation (\Delta I=Io)2 = (*=10\Gamma 6:80Hz)\Gamma 1:50 (1) where * is
   the time frequency in Hz. This implies variations of 0.4% on timescales
   of one hour and variations of 1.7% over the course of a night. At La
   Silla, Burki, et al., 1995 found that the total U -band extinction is
   correlated over a period of several days and that over one night the
   autocorrelation drops by only 5% (implying a typical 2.2% variation in
   extinction). These data indicate that ,1% extinction variations can be
   expected over the course of a clear night, even at the best
   astronomical sites. A closer examination of the following extinction
   components is needed to help clarify the source and spectral
   characteristics of such extinction variations: Rayleigh scattering:
   Extinction due to Rayleigh scattering, kR, is known to follow aR*\Gamma
   4+x, where x , 0:04 is a very small correction to the canonical law.
   Rayleigh scattering dominates the extinction at most wavelengths under
   photometric conditions. aR depends on the molecular scale height
   (roughly 8 km) which depends on altitude, and on weakly varying
   parameters like temperature, T , and pressure, P . Aerosols: Extinction
   due to aerosol scattering, ka, is generally the second greatest
   contributor. ka is often parameterized as aa*fl (*Angstrom 1961). fl
   can vary widely, as shown in Fig. 2, 2 Figure 2: The variation in the
   *Angstrom aerosol extinction parameter, fl, measured over Mauna Loa in
   1999. The central bar is the median, the boxes define the 25--75%
   range, and the outer whiskers denote the 5--95% range. Note that the
   *Angstrom exponent in this graph is equal to \Gamma fl. (From
   wwwsrv.cmdl.noaa.gov/aero/net/mlo/datacheck mlo.html.) using
   observations from Mauna Loa. fl depends on the particle size
   distribution of the aerosols, which shows variation with the source of
   a given mass of air and can change appreciably after significant
   volcanic explosions. Burki et al.1995 determined fl = \Gamma 1:39 for
   La Silla using nights of low extinction. My modeling of the Mauna Kea
   extinction curve using libRadtrans indicates that a simple power law is
   inadequate to describe the aerosol scattering at that site. The
   aerosols on Mauna Kea are likely a mix of sea salt and volcanic dust
   from the summit and/or nearly islands ("vog," as it is known in
   Hawaii). The strong temperature inversion layer below the summit helps
   to keep a significant fraction of aerosols below the summit. Scattering
   (but not absorption) by suspended water droplets is generally included
   in the aerosol scattering budget. Water vapor and ice: The extinction
   due to absorption by water vapor or clouds, kH2O;a is generally absent
   or weak weak expect at a few wavelength intervals in the red. The night
   time scale height for H2O is roughly 1 km. CSO monitoring indicates
   that kH2O;a easily varies by factors of 2 over a few days (outer
   quartiles at 1.7 and 5.9 mm of water), and by several tens of a percent
   during a night on Mauna Kea (see Figs. 3 and 4). kH2O;s only need be
   considered when clouds are present. It will be very time-variable as
   clouds pass through the field of view. 3 Figure 3: The frequency
   distribution of water vapor typical of Mauna Kea. kH2O;s is spectrally
   neutral according to theory due to the large number of random scatters
   in large water droplets or ice crystals. Oxygen: Extinction due to
   ozone absorption, kO3, sets the UV limit for terrestrial observations,
   but is generally smaller than Rayleigh scattering over most of the
   optical spectrum. kO3 has a spectral shape which is well known, but
   it's amplitude has seasonal variations and it is also reported to vary
   on timescales of hours (Hayes & Latham 1975). Daily O3 observations
   covering 1966--2000 from Mauna Loa have a dispersion of 7%, with
   peak-to-peak variations of 36% (see www.cmdl.noaa.gov/dobson). A
   histogram of daily Mauna Loa ozone column values is shown in Fig 5. O2
   also produces absorption, kO2, which results in the A and B band
   absorption features. These are strong but narrow, and their shape is
   well known. It is generally assumed that extinction sources follow the
   Beers-Lambert relation: Iobs = Itruee\Gamma kX (2) so the relation
   between the true spectrum of a star, S(*), and its observed spectrum,
   s(*; t; X) is given by: s(*; t; X) = OE(*; t),(*; t)DS(*; t)S(*)
   exp[\Gamma X 5X i ki(*; t)] (3) 4 Figure 4: Representative Mauna Kea
   water vapor monitor readings, from CSO. Exceptions include kO2, which
   goes as X0:55, but this contribution can be easily determined from
   spectroscopy since it is so spectrally isolated. Assuming that the
   Beers-Lambert relation holds, the total extinction can be written as:
   k(*; t) = kR(*) + ka(*) + kO3(*) + kH2O;a(*) + kH2O;s(*) + kO2(*) =
   aR(t)*\Gamma 4+x + aa(t)*fl + aO3(t)o/O3 (*) + aH2O(t)o/H2O(*) +
   acldo/cld(*)) + aO2 (t)o/O2(*) (4) The functions o/i(*) represent the
   spectral properties of those extinction terms which are somewhat
   complicated, but which are known from external measurements. Note here
   I have separated the H2O into a "normal" component which includes only
   absorption, and a "cloud" component. The scattering due to water vapor
   is not included in the "normal" component since it is is already
   accounted for in the aerosol-scattering term. The "cloud" term accounts
   for scattering by water and ice in clouds. o/cld can change slightly
   depending on the ice/water fraction of the clouds, and further work is
   needed to characterize such changes. Additional absorption by water
   vapor in clouds is accounted for in the above scheme by the "normal"
   water component. 2 Extinction Correction under Photometric Conditions
   When conditions are photometric, k is isotropic on the sky and has no
   time dependence. In this case k(*) = P5i ki(*) can be solved for in
   Eqn. 2 by observing the spectrum, s(*; t; X), of at least two stars
   with known intrinsic spectrum, S(*). This statement implicitly assumes
   that the combined response of the telescope, instrumentation, and
   detector, given by: C(*; t) = OE(*; t),(*; t)DS(*; t) (5) 5 Figure 5:
   Histogram of Ozone over Mauna Loa, measured in Dobson units. Values are
   based on daily observations since 1966. is constant in time. That is,
   it is assumed that C(*; t) = C(*), an issue which will be discussed
   below. If k(*) is solved for at each wavelength, it is not necessary to
   determine the individual ki(*) values for each extinction component.
   However, if k(*) must be smoothed due to low S/N or other reasons, then
   the relative contributions of the smooth (kR, ka, kO3,kH2O;s) and
   structured (kH2O;a, kO2) components must be determined separately. Most
   reduction methods do this in an approximate way by only separating
   kH2O;a and kO2 at wavelengths were they are very large, and including
   spectral regions where they are not so strong in the calculation of the
   smooth component. It will be useful to verify the above
   parameterization of k by decomposition of the SNfactory observations of
   spectrophotometric standards. This is tractable because the relative
   contributions of the various components vary with wavelength. Table 1
   gives the relative contributions to the total extinction (mostly from
   La Silla); several key wavelengths at which a given atmospheric
   component will be most easily separable have extinction values
   indicated in bold. Table 1 is also useful for identifying the
   extinction components which must be well-determined to provide better
   than 1% flux calibration. For instance, at most wavelengths kR
   dominates and must be well-determined. Fortunately the behavior of
   kR(*) is well known. ka must be 6 Table 1: Extinction components per
   airmass at various wavelengths * Rayleigh Aerosol Ozone Water O2

   better than 10% (meaning constraints on both aa and fl), while the
   amplitude aO3 can be uncertain by 20%, before these sources cause any
   appreciable error. H2O and O2 must be determined very well (1%), but
   only at certain wavelengths where they are well isolated from the other
   components. A great advantage over existing work in this area is the
   large simultaneous wavelength coverage the SNfactory spectrograph will
   provide. 3 Extinction Correction under Non-Photometric Conditions Two
   levels of non-photometric conditions can be defined: Mildly
   non-photometric conditions are defined to occur when k is neither
   isotropic nor time invariant, but before the formation of any visible
   clouds. These conditions can occur for a number of reasons, most
   notably a transition from one weather system to another during which
   the aerosol content and composition, water content, temperature, and
   pressure are changing. (Note that the arrival of a new weather system
   changes temperature and pressure, which should therefore be routinely
   monitored as a clue that conditions may be non-photometric.) These
   conditions can also occur due to sinking of the aerosol layer (whose
   scale-height is typically only ,1.5 km), and to a lesser degree the
   molecular layer (having an 8 km scale-height), during the night as the
   atmosphere cools. Strongly non-photometric conditions are defined to
   occur whenever clouds of any kind are present. Since efficiency
   decreases quickly with cloud optical depth, the only situation under
   which fruitful observations might proceed is for thin cirrus clouds. In
   this situation, the scattering properties of clouds enter into the
   extinction through kH2O;s. As mentioned before, kH2O;s is fairly gray
   (spectrally neutral). Under mildly non-photometric conditions where
   temporal and spatial variations in k consist of large pockets of air,
   as with different weather systems, then the observations of
   spectrophotometric standard stars close in time and sky location to the
   observation of program objects may allow localized correction for
   extinction. Unfortunately, the accuracy of this approach is difficult
   to verify, since the location and temporal variations in k are not
   known a priori. With sufficient observations, trends in the standard
   star observations can be examined for evidence of smooth changes or an
   isolated transition in time or sky location. Only under these very
   simple situations can calibration exclusively from spectrophotometric
   standards hope to be sufficiently accurate. 7 Under strongly
   non-photometric conditions, observations of spectrophotometric
   standards is only of value of determining the relation between kH2O;a
   and kH2O;s. Therefore, additional methods are needed in order for
   useful observations to be obtained under non-photometric conditions.
   3.1 The role of a parallel imager With the advent of CCD's, imaging
   follow-up of variable events such as supernovae has exploited the fact
   that over small fields of view non-photometric conditions tend to
   uniformly depress the flux from all objects in the field. Thus,
   non-variable objects in the field can be used as comparison objects,
   and once the brightness of such comparison objects is determined under
   photometric conditions, the relative brightness between the target
   object and comparison objects can be converted to an absolute flux.
   There are potential problems with this approach, namely the issues of
   whether the non-photometric conditions really are constant over a
   field, and whether the nonphotometric conditions have a reasonably
   neutral spectrum so that the scaling does not depend on the spectrum of
   the comparison stars. The constancy of the non-photometric conditions
   across a field can be determined directly by comparing the variation in
   scaling determined using field stars observed during both photometric
   and non-photometric conditions. Thus, this uncertainty can be built
   directly into the error budget. For long exposures, a range of cloud
   patterns should be swept across the field of view, so most variations
   should be slowly varying across the field. Most SNfactory supernova
   fields will be visited many times, and conditions can be expected to be
   photometric for some fraction of those visits. In particular, the visit
   during which a final reference spectrum is obtained can be chosen to
   occur during photometric conditions since it is not time-critical. The
   imager will observe many stars surrounding each supernova. The
   intrinsic spectrum, F (*) of these stars is unknown and some fraction
   of them may be variable. The observation of star n, fn(*i; t; ff; ffi)
   can be presented as fn(*i; t; ff; ffi) = 1Z 0 t+\Delta tZ t OE(*;
   t),*i(*i; t)DI (*; t)Fn(*) exp[\Gamma X 5X i ki(*; t; ff; ffi)]d*dt (6)
   Where the imager instrument response, ,*i(*; t), is dominated by the
   response of a chosen filter, denoted by its central wavelength, *i.
   Since parallel imaging is only of value for photometric corrections of
   observations are obtained a precisely the same time as the
   spectroscopy, we assume that the interval t to t + \Delta t is
   identical for both instruments and use tj to label the observation at
   epoch j. This necessity leads to a derived requirement for common or
   synchronized shutters for the spectrograph and imager. Assuming that
   the extinction is constant over a very small patch of sky surrounding
   the supernova and observed by the imager, and using the index xk to
   label the field, one can write: fn;*i;tj;xk = fn;*i;tj (ff; ffi) (7)
   Thus, for each star in a field the variation at a given wavelength
   during the course of j epochs is mapped out. Since some observations
   are obtained during photometric conditions, the absolute brightness of
   each star can be determined and subtracted to give the absolute
   variation: \Delta fn;*i;tj;xk = fn;*i;tj;xk \Gamma fn;*i;xk;corr (8) 8
   where corr denotes a flux corrected for extinction under photometric
   conditions. The measurements for all the stars observed in one image
   can be combined, to give: \Delta f *i;tj;xk = 1N NX n=1 \Delta
   fn;*i;tj;xk (9) Clearly these values of \Delta f *i;tj;xk provide some
   indication of the extinction variations over the wavelength span of
   each filter, and for a set of wavelengths should give some information
   on the extinction which applied to the contemporaneous and nearly
   co-spatial supernova observation. However, there are two problems here.
   First, note that without explicit knowledge of the *-dependencies of
   the other terms in the integral of Eqn 6, fn;*i;corr can not be
   calculated usingP 5 i=1 ki(*) determined from spectrophotometric
   standard star observations. Instead each field,x k, would have to be
   followed as a function of airmass on a photometric night so that
   fn;*i;corr on the instrumental system of the SNfactory imager could be
   determined for each star in that field. Such observations could be done
   quite easily, but at some loss of observing efficiency on photometric
   nights. Second, with a single filter, only the average extinction
   correction over one wavelength interval is being measured at the time
   of the supernova observation. Given the earlier discussion showing that
   extinction has multiple components which do not scale together, such a
   measurement could only provide an average correction for the portion of
   the spectrum covered by the imager filter. Extrapolating to other
   filters would be difficult, but not necessarily impossible. For
   instance, in the case of increased water vapor due to incipient cirrus,
   one could imagine monitoring a water absorption band to estimate the
   column of water. The scattering component due to water will only become
   gray once clouds actually form since multiple scattering is required,
   however, by spectrally monitoring a standard star under such
   conditions, a mapping between the water vapor absorption and the
   extinction should be found and used for correction purposes. (As
   discussed earlier, water scattering depends somewhat on whether water
   is in ice or liquid form, and on the circumstances of ice formation.
   Thus, any such relation would have an associated uncertainty whose
   expected size is not known at present.) Similarly, changes in aerosol
   content can be important contributors to non-photometric conditions and
   one could imagine monitoring one bandpass to detect changes \Delta aa,
   in the aerosol content if water vapor and other contributors were
   stable. Of course ka depends on aa and fl, so it would be necessary to
   assume a value of fl in order to extrapolate to other wavelengths. A
   typical value (and dispersion) for fl would be known from
   spectrophotometric standards observed under photometric conditions,
   however, Fig. 2 shows that this parameter isn't necessarily that
   stable. Knowledge of fl to \Sigma 0:2 is sufficient to keep the
   calibration uncertainty below about 1%, for typical ka. Since
   extinction correction using monitoring one one wavelength is not
   necessarily sufficient, a solution for this and the field-star
   calibration problem will now be addressed. 3.2 Multicolor field-star
   monitoring One might imagine simply expanding the above approach to
   include multiple filters. Since the observations must be taken
   simultaneously with spectroscopic observations, an imager would have to
   monitor different stars in a field using a single multicolor filter
   (e.g., a series of adjacent filters close to the focal plane). By
   covering the entire optical spectrum with filters, one would 9 obtain
   the correct mean scaling for each portion of the simultaneous
   spectroscopic observations. However, even such full-coverage multicolor
   monitoring will not provide sufficient information to perfectly remove
   extinction since the different extinction components do not vary
   together. The uncertainty in this approach is difficult to predict
   because it depends on details of how much different extinction
   components can vary. In regions unaffected by water absorption, this
   approach might work rather well. Table 1 and the previous discussion
   suggests a means of breaking the degeneracy amongst extinction
   components present in single-band or even full-coverage multicolor
   monitoring under non-photometric conditions. Namely, if \Delta f
   *i;tj;xk is determined at wavelengths where each extinction component
   dominates, the parameterization of Eqn 4 could be used to determine the
   correct extinction to apply to the spectroscopic observations.
   Monitoring would have to occur at all *i at the same time in order to
   account for variations of all the extinction components. The parameters
   to be determined are aR(tj),aa(tj),fl(tj),aO3 (tj), and aH20(tj). It is
   probable that aO2 can still be determined using spectrophotometric
   standard star observations, even under non-photometric conditions, so
   it is not included here. Methods of this type are routinely used in
   remote sensing experiments. If the instrument response is assumed to be
   constant, an observation taken with the imager in filter *i, at time tj
   in field xk can be described by: fn;*i;tj;xk = 1Z 0
   OE(*),*i(*)DI(*)Fn;xk(*) exp[\Gamma X 5X i=1 ki(*; t; ff; ffi)]d* (10)
   The extinction term can be decomposed into its various components 5X
   i=1 ki(*; t; ff; ffi) = aR;tj *\Gamma 4+x + aa;tj *fl + aO3;tj o/O3(*)
   + aH2O;tj o/H2O(*) + acld;tj o/cld(*) (11) giving fn;*i;tj;xk = 1Z 0

   o/O3(*)+aH2O;tj o/H2O(*)+acld;tj o/cld(*))]d* (12) In order to solve
   for the amplitudes of the various extinction components, the above
   equation can be linearized by expanding the extinction terms in the
   exponential about the mean extinction--airmass product, ! Xo/ ?, in the
   given filter, e.g., fn;*i;tj;xk , e\Gamma hXo/i 1Z 0 C*i(*)Fn;xk(*) [1

   This approximation should be good to better than 1% for typical
   extinction values. The key is that observations in all I filters must
   be taken simultaneously. Only in this case can the number of degrees of
   freedom possibly be greater than zero (and as shown below, it is also
   necessary that that the number of epochs be six or greater. A set of
   nearly linear equations relates the observables, fn;*i;tj;xk, to the
   unknown a's and V 's. The equations have a slight non-linearity due to
   the additional unknown fl's which effects the Va;n;*i's. It is almost
   certain that aR, aa, and fl will be correlated, but if the extinction
   correction so obtained is good, then this is not an issue. Of course
   the full correlation must be included in the calculations of the
   uncertainties. The number of observables are the fluxes in I filters,
   in K fields, of the NK stars, for JK epochs. Nobs = IX filters KX
   fields JKX epochs NKX stars (17) (The values of the five a's and one fl
   determined for L of J photometric epochs from spectroscopy of
   spectrophotometric standards are not counted here): As an example, for
   equal numbers of stars and epochs in each field, Nobs = IKJN = K(IJ N
   ). The number of parameters is given by the five a's and one fl, to be
   determined at JK \Gamma LK non-photometric epochs in K fields, plus the
   six V 's for NK stars in K fields for the I filters: Npar = 6 KX fields
   JK\Gamma LKX epochs + 6 IX filters KX fields NKX stars (18) Again, for
   equal numbers of stars and epochs in each field, Npar = 6K(J \Gamma L)
   + 6IKN . Note that for well-chosen filters, there will be just a few
   dominant V 's for each measurement. In particular, for the water
   absorption filter all but one V can be zero for a properly-chosen
   filter. This reduces the number of unknowns. Likewise, it is reasonable
   to expect that aR will not vary 11 strongly during a night and so can
   be held fixed over the K fields observed on a given night, further
   reducing the number of free parameters. To ensure that Npar ! Nobs we
   require 6K((J \Gamma L) + IN ) ! K(IJ N ). Since in this treatment each
   field is independent, the number of fields, K, cancels out. This can be
   reduced to IN (J \Gamma 6)\Gamma 6(J \Gamma L) ? 0, which sets a
   minimum requirement that the number of epochs J ? 6. Of course the
   number of degrees of freedom is not the entire story. As discussed
   earlier, decomposition of extinction into its various components is
   unlikely to succeed unless there is at least one wellpositioned filter
   per component. Although additional stars help, a range of spectral
   types is required to provide substantially new information. The above
   analysis shows that in principle the appropriate extinction as a
   function of wavelength can be determined from multicolor photometry of
   field stars taken simultaneously with spectrophotometric observations
   of a program object under non-photometric conditions. This method can
   be tested directly using such observations of spectrophotometric
   standard stars. Monte Carlo simulations, and up-to-date absorption
   spectral functions, are needed to validate the above analysis and to
   determine the best filters (central wavelengths, widths, and shapes)
   for the multicolor field-star monitoring. 4 The need to monitor system
   stability So far it has been assumed that the OE(*; t), ,*i(t), and DI
   (*; t) are constant over the entire one year period during which each
   supernova is observed. Moreover, even if parallel multicolor fieldstar
   observations are obtained to determine the extinction, the zero-point
   of the spectrograph, ,(*; t), and the detector, DS(*; t) must be known
   in order to obtain spectrophotometry from the extinction-corrected
   spectra. Before exploring a solution, the possible sources of
   zero-point change should be discussed. First, the telescope optics will
   collect dust and undergo cleaning and recoating. Dust accumulation
   alone can amount to 0.001 mag/day. The imaging filters, ,*i (t) will
   have bandpasses that shift with temperature (and possibly humidity),
   and they will suffer degradation over time. The spectrograph optics
   should be fairly stable, however the dichroic beam-splitter can be
   expected to show changes with temperature, and to degrade over time.
   Finally, the QE(*) for the CCD detectors (DS and DI ) will depend on
   cold-head temperature, and outgassing in the dewar will result in slow
   condensation of contaminants on the face of the detectors. In the case
   of the spectrograph, regular observations of spectrophotometric
   standards on photometric nights will measure the product CS(*; t) =
   OE(*; t),(*; t)DS(*; t) directly. Thus, if all sources of drift in the
   spectrograph zero-point are very slow, and photometric conditions occur
   sufficiently often, it may be possible to track CS(*; t) for the
   spectrograph reasonably well. Sufficient standard stars will have to be
   observed to even ascertain whether or not conditions are photometric,
   unless there are other constraints on variations in CS(*; t). An
   approach using standard stars also might be considered for the imager.
   However, since the V 's result from integrals over the spectral
   response of the imager and the unknown spectrum of the monitoring
   stars, shifts in filter wavelength -- not just zero-point shifts --
   become an issue. In the parlance of ordinary photometry, this problem
   is one of a changing color term. In ordinary photometry, color terms
   are constrained by observation of stars having a wide range of spectra
   (colors), and such an approach might be possible here. 12 The careful
   reader will have noticed that with each new requirement needed to
   enable the use of non-photometric conditions, more and more of the
   observing time when conditions are photometric must be used for
   calibration. If calibration can not be done very quickly, observations
   described in this section will represent an undo burden. Moreover, the
   frequency of photometric conditions compared to expected changes in
   zero-points and color-terms is not yet known; if changes are fast
   compared to the frequency of photometric nights the calibration plan
   for using non-photometric nights may fail completely. Young (1975)
   recommends that all precision photometry systems be monitored for
   stability using laboratory sources. This seems to be exactly what is
   required here. Since we are concerned with changes in both zero-points
   and color-terms, one solution would be to observe artificial stars
   produced by a suite of two or more stable lamps having different color
   temperature. The telescope response, OE(*; t), is common to both the
   spectrograph and imager, and provided it is reasonably stable, the main
   outstanding calibration that is needed is that between the spectrograph
   and the imager. 4.1 Imager-to-Spectrograph scaling In principle, a
   reference lamp observed simultaneously with the imager and the
   spectrograph will give the relative response of the spectrograph and
   imager. Imagine that the response of filters or spectral elements
   change only by scale factors, ffX , defined as follows: CI(*; tj) =
   ffCI;tj CI (*) (imager) (19) CS(*; tj) = ffCS;tj CS(*) (spectrograph)
   (20) L(*; tj) = ffL;tj L(*); (21) where L(*) is the lamp spectrum.
   Simultaneous observations of the lamp with the imager and spectrograph
   at epoch t1, OI(t1) and OS(t1) are given by: OI (t1) = 1Z 0 ffCI;tj CI
   (*)ffL;tj L(*)d* (22) OS(t1) = ffCS;tj CS(*0)ffL;tj L(*0); (23) where
   *0 is arbitrary in this formulation. The ratio of these measurements
   yields: OI(t1) OS(t1) = 1R 0 ff CI;tj CI (*)ffL;tj L(*)d* ffCS;tj
   CS(*0)ffL;tj L(*0) = !1 1R 0 C I (*)L(*)d* L(*0) (24) The values of !tj
   thus track the relative sensitivity of the imager and spectrograph for
   any combination of imager filter and spectrograph wavelength, *0
   (although it will be most sensible to compare at similar wavelengths,
   as will now be shown). Of course it is likely that changes in the lamp
   spectrum will occur at different epochs unless care is taken to
   stabilize its response. How well must the lamp spectrum be stabilized?
   Following King (1952), the above integrals can be expanded as a Taylor
   series in derivatives of the lamp 13 spectrum. The expansion is taken
   about the wavelength which is the 1st moment of the imager response
   (filter plus detector): *0 = _1 = ffCI ;tj 1R 0 *C I (*)d* ffCI;tj 1R 0
   C I (*)d* = 1R 0 *C I (*)d* 1R 0 C I (*)d* (25) (Note that *0 is immune
   to scaling changes in the imager response.) The expansion given by King
   results in: OI (t1) ss ffCI ;tj `L(*0) 1Z 0 CI (*)d* + dL(*)d* 1Z 0 (*
   \Gamma *0)CI (*)d* + 12 d 2L(*) d*2 1Z 0 (* \Gamma *0)2CI (*)d*' (26)
   ss ffCI ;tj `L(*0) 1Z 0 CI (*)d* + 12 d 2L(*) d*2 1Z 0 (* \Gamma *0)2CI
   (*)d*' (27) ss ~ffCI ;tj `L(*0) + 12_22` d 2L(*) d*2 j*0 ''; (28) where
   _2 is the 2nd moment of the imager bandpass, and is defined in a manner
   analogous to _1. Note that the definition of *0 forces the 1st order
   term in the Taylor expansion to zero. Now the earlier expression for
   the relative scaling of the imager and spectrograph can be rewritten
   as: OI(t1) OS(t1) = ~!1 L(*0) + 12 _22` d 2L(*) d*2) j* 0 ' L(*0) =
   ~!1`1 + 1 2_ 22` 1 L(*0) d2L(*) d*2) j* 0 '' (29) Here it is made clear
   that the observed flux ratio, OI(t1)=OS(t1), tracks the relative
   response of the imager and spectrograph only if the normalized 2nd
   derivative of the lamp spectrum at the filter wavelength *0 is very
   small or the same from epoch to epoch. Therefore, a lamp with a linear
   spectrum (in photons), or a temperature-stabilized lamp is required.
   Since linear spectrum sources aren't available (to our knowledge!), the
   required temperature stability has been investigated. For a filter
   having _2 , 400*A, a NIST-calibrated FEL lamp stabilized at a color
   temperature of T = 2856 \Sigma 8K (see Fig. 6) is just sufficient to
   keep color errors below 0.5% across the entire optical spectrum (the
   most stringent constraint is for *0 ! 4000*A). A warmer lamp, with T ,
   5000K, would have an even smaller sensitivity. The ability to track the
   relative response of the imager and the spectrograph leads to a derived
   requirement for a stabilized lamp, preferably having as small of a
   normalized 2nd derivative as possible so that the stability of _2 is
   not a factor. 4.2 Imager wavelength shifts and bandwidth changes In the
   above discussion, a characteristic wavelength, *0, was defined for each
   imager channel. For all glass and interference filters the
   characteristic bandpass is dependent on the ambient 14
