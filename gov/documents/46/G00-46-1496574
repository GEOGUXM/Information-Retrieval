   Africanized Honey Bee Pest Profile


   Africanized Bee Illustration Common Name: Africanized Honey Bee (AHB)

   Scientific Name: Apis mellifera scutellata

   Order and Family: Hymenoptera: Apidae

   Description
          It is extremely difficult to distinguish AHB from European Honey
          Bees (EHB). Only after complex laboratory analysis of
          morphological characters is it possible to state the probability
          that a group of bees is Africanized. That is, scientists have
          developed a probability table using 0.00 to indicate absolute
          assurance that bees are European and 1.00 to indicate absolute
          assurance that bees are Africanized.

   History and Economic Importance
          Major behaviorial differences which distinguish AHB from EHB are
          general exitability, defensiveness, frequent swarming, and an
          ability to nest in a wide range of sites. Swarming is the
          primary mode of spread. When a swarm finds a suitable nesting
          site, it may nest there and construct combs. If a shortage of
          food, water, or space develops, a swarm will move (abscond) to a
          more suitable location. As the number of bees in the nest
          increase, they produce reproductive swarms which seek new
          nesting sites. Reproductive swarming can occur every six weeks,
          especially during heavy nectar flow periods.

   Life Cycle
          The following is a brief description of the complete
          metamorphasis:

     * Egg: The eggs are white and sausage shaped. The caudal (oval) end
       of the egg is attached to the base of the cell. A fertilized egg
       develops into a female bee (worker); a nonfertilized egg develops
       into a male bee (drone). Hatching occurs when the egg is
       approximately 60 hours old.
     * Larva: Larvae are fed glandular secretions originating in the head
       of young nurse bees. Larva destined to become queens are mass fed
       on royal jelly in a peanut-shaped cell. Eight days after the egg is
       laid, the cell containing the worker is capped, and on the ninth
       day the larva spins a cocoon. The prepupal stage is reached on the
       tenth day.
     * Pupa: On the eleventh day, the white and motionless pupal form is
       evident. From the thirteenth day to the twentieth day, the eye
       color develops. The twentieth day, the adult emerges from the cell.
     * Adult Bees: The worker has a normal life of about 30 days. The
       normal life span of drones is five to 10 weeks. The queen usually
       lives from one to three years.

   Hosts and Damage
          Generally, most flowering plants are hosts for honey bees.
          However, some species seem to be more attractive than others to
          bees. In general terms, the herbaceaous annual and perennial
          species in North America which are more than usually attractive
          include mints, milkweeds, clovers, and asters. Mountain mint and
          swamp milkweed seem to be the most attractive species documented
          at this time.
