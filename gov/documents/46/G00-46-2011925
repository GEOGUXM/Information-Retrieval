     HPCC is currently investigating ways to insure that information
     viewed from NOAA web sites is as current as possible. To do this,
     HPCC is researching applications called "intelligent agents."

     An intelligent agent is capable of monitoring data located in
     various locations, as well as being able to interact with other
     agents to perform certain tasks. One goal is to use intelligent
     agents to search all of NOAA's web sites to see which has the most
     up-to-date information and then have that data promulgated to areas
     accessible to key personnel. Obviously, for issues such as violent
     weather events, current information is critical to reducing both
     human and economic impact.


                             Technical Approach

     * Leverage advanced information technologies developed by IT R&D
       partners to support NOAA researchers
     * Test agent technologies for information quality assurance

                               Recent Results

     * Enhanced distributed Image Spreadsheet
     * Developed Ocean Share collaborative environment

                                 What's Next

     * Pilot advanced information cataloging profiling and notification
       tools
     * Develop prototype agent to assess the state of important NOAA web
       sites
     * Develop collaborative protocols to support realtime immersive
       virtual reality
