   Research and Development encompasses the design and implementation of
   technologies for increased productivity and efficiency of
   high-throughput methods for determining the DNA sequence of genetic
   material, and investigating the genes and regulatory elements contained
   therein. We emphasize methods that enable systematic inquiry into
   information encoded in genomic sequence generated at the Joint Genome
   Institute. Current research is focused on large-scale gene expression
   patterns as well as methods for determining structure and function of
   the proteins encoded by these genes. Protocol development emphasizes
   increased throughput and productivity while reducing reagent use and
   cost. These procedures are also designed to be adapted for automation
   using commercial and customized instrumentation platforms.
