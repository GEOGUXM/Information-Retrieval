                             Accounting Services

   Welcome to the Accounting Services page. The following paragraphs
   provide an overview of accounting services offered to Federal
   customers. We are a full service accounting operation with extensive
   experience, modern systems, and quality service. If you require further
   information e-mail us at the address at the bottom of this page.

   More than 110 accountants and accounting technicians are assigned to
   ARCs administrative accounting staff. The staff includes several
   Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) and Certified Government Financial
   Managers (CGFMs), in addition to many accountants with substantial
   technical experience in Federal accounting operations and financial
   systems administration. We have over five years experience in handling
   transactions of remote customers, including several Treasury entities
   and independent agencies.

   ARC provides a suite of financial applications that offer agency CFOs
   an affordable, integrated, financial management solution that meets
   Federal reporting requirements. The applications are internet-based,
   thus customers need only have internet access and a browser for any
   workstation to access all our systems. No additional hardware or
   software is required. Our suite of applications includes the following:
   Oracle Federal Financials 11i is our core financial management system,
       which provides accounts payable, accounts receivable, general
       ledger, and budgeting functionality. Oracle Federal Financials is a
       commercial-off-the-shelf software package that is JFMIP-certified
       to meet Federal government accounting needs. ARC personnel operate
       and maintain the system primarily with in-house staff, ensuring
       top-notch support while keeping costs low. ARC staff is developing
       an extension to the system to provide an automated interface and
       database for payroll transactions.
       Oracle Discoverer is our ad-hoc reporting system, which provides
       real-time and user-friendly access to data in the Oracle Federal
       Financial system. Discoverer meets the needs of both the casual
       user and the financial user that needs extensive reporting
       capabilities. Discoverer allows agencies to place timely financial
       information on the desktops of managers and budget analysts.
       Compusearch Prism is our procurement system that is fully
       integrated with Oracle Federal Financials. Prism provides purchase
       requisition preparation, approval, and submission with real-time
       funds checking. Prism also offers a wide range of procurement
       functionality for acquisition personnel.
       Gelco Travel Manager is our travel system that is interfaced with
       Oracle Federal Financials. This state-of-the-art system allows
       remote users to process travel actions without having to transmit
       paper to the accounting provider. Travel documents are processed
       and paid automatically and documents are sampled after-the-fact to
       ensure the process is working correctly. The system makes preparing
       documents easy and ensures travel reimbursements are timely.

   We also operate and maintain the Federal Financial System (FFS), by
   American Management Systems. A separate Reports Management System (RMS)
   database is maintained to meet required and adhoc reporting needs. Our
   trained systems accountants have seven years experience using FFS.

   ARCs administrative accounting operation has a long-standing track
   record for:
     * Paying invoices on time
     * Reimbursing travelers quickly
     * Providing timely budget reports

   funds, as well as revolving and trust funds. We prepare financial
   statements and various other financial management reports for customers
   on a regular basis, and provide financial audit support. ARCs staff
   maintains expertise in Federal travel regulations, standard general
   ledger, appropriation law, audited financial statements, prompt payment
   act, relocation travel, and budget execution.

   Administrative accounting is the cornerstone of ARCs service package.

   of outstanding service. If you would like further information please
