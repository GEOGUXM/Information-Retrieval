                       Volunteer At the Museum

        The State Museum offers a variety of interesting opportunities
         for volunteers, from assisting in research laboratories and
         administrative offices to helping school children and other
         visitors. Whether you are retired and have a skill you would
         like to share, or you have a few hours a week that you would
        like to contribute in an exciting and educational environment,
             the Museum will welcome you as a volunteer. For more
                        information, call 518/474-1569
