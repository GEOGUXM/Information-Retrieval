   NITC Strategic Plan
   Strategic Plan Image [1pix_black.gif]

   With the latest NITC Strategic Plan, we define the NITC vision (where
   we want to be in five years) and express our support of the USDA
   Information Resources Management (IRM) mission and the goals of the
   Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO).

   The plan also helps to ensure that employees can gain an understanding
   of how their initiatives and activities fit as part of the overall
   strategic direction of the organization.
