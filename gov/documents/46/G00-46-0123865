   Information For Business

   The Office of Financial Management serves the Washington business
   community primarily as a resource for information about state finances,
   demographic and economic trends, and state contracting practices. The
   Guide to Personal Service Contracting is online, along with other OFM
   publications such as Guidelines for Determining Architectural and
   Engineering Fees.

   OFM's statewide and regional data can also be a resource to your
   research team. From per capita personal income statistics to the number
   of licensed drivers for each county within the state, finding the
   information you're looking for can be a simple click away .
