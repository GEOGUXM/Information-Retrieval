   Future Remote Geologist

   OBJECTIVES:
   Provide real-time analysis and identification of geological specimens
   during planetary surface exploration missions:

   The Smart Systems Research Lab at NASA Ames Research Center is
   developing smart Geological Probes that will enable a semi-autonomous /
   autonomous robotic rover to function as a remote geologist in exploring
   the terrain of distant sites.

   The Geological Probe's smart software provides instantaneous synthesis
   of high-dimensional data gathered by microsensors at the probe's tip
   and relevant information available from other sources external to the
   probe, and analyzes/interprets the results in real-time based on what
   it has learned from prior discoveries and on what it has been taught
   using known substances.

   A 3D graphical interface enables a user to interactively control the
   actions of the robotic Geological Probe while viewing the specimen
   under study. The smart software performs high dimensional
   characterization of the specimen and combines it with a rich a priori
   information base to provide a powerful diagnostic capability for
   geological exploration.
