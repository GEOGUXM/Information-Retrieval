         Speaker Hastert Responds To President's State of the Union

                              January 29, 2002

   Washington, D.C. -- House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-IL) made the
   following statement today:

   "Tonight, the President once again proved that he is the right leader
   for the American people, outlining a plan that will help us defeat
   terrorism, protect our homeland and create jobs for our economy. He
   gave a strong speech and outlined a clear agenda that will make the
   American people more secure in their homes, in their jobs and with
   their families.

   "While we have made much progress in the war against terrorism, now is
   no time to let our guard down. The President is right to remain focused
   on eradicating terrorism and keeping the people of our nation free from
   harm. Throughout the upcoming legislative year, Congress is committed
   to working with the President to eliminate terrorist threats against
   America - and to put safeguards in place to prevent future attacks. We
   must use all the resources at our disposal to ensure that our country
   remains free and strong.

   "In tonight's speech, the President also made it clear that we cannot
   turn our attention away from our struggling economy. To do so would be
   to turn our backs on out-of-work families all across America. It is
   evident that our economy still desperately needs an economic security
   package that will create jobs and expand benefits for the newly
   unemployed. While the House already has twice passed an economic plan
   to help America's workers, we can advance no further until the Senate
   agrees to do their part to help our nation's unemployed.

   "While an economic security package is essential, the President pointed
   that there are several other factors that lead to a strong economy. We
   need to pursue policies that provide Americans with a top-notch
   education; affordable and accountable healthcare, which includes
   prescription drugs; a secure retirement; a comprehensive energy policy;
   and new markets for American goods through expanded trade.

   "I applaud President Bush for laying out such a clear plan for the
   future of this country, and I look forward to working with him to carry
   out his common-sense agenda."
