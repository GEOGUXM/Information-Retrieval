   The purpose of the Defense and Civil Programs office is to acquire and
   manage opportunities to develop and demonstrate technology that enables
   or enhance the NASA mission and the missions of defense and civil
   agencies. We do this in conjunction with the technical divisions and
   through strategic sponsorships and partnerships.
     * Objective: Help the technical divisions acquire and manage
       meaningful work that will ultimately help NASA missions.
     * Objective: Establish working partnerships with relevant government
       agencies, industry, other research laboratories, and academia.
     * Objective: Help technical divisions get sponsors that will maintain
       or develop their technical capability, centers of excellence and
       core competencies.
     * Objective: Respond appropriately to opportunities to apply our JPL
       special capabilities to technical and scientific problems of
       national significance.
