   Coral reefs in the Caribbean and western Atlantic are deteriorating in
   response to hurricanes, coral diseases, anchor damage, sedimentation,
   and other stresses.  USGS biologists at the Caribbean Field Station are
   documenting the current status of coral reefs and the effects of some
   of these stresses within Virgin Islands National Park (St. John), Buck
   Island Reef National Monument (St. Croix), and Dry Tortugas National
   Park (Florida).  The primary objective is to detect change in benthic
   cover over time using a statistically rigorous protocol.
