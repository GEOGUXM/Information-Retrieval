Directory of  State Long Term Care Ombudsman Programs
   _____________________________________________________________________

   Long-term care ombudsmen are advocates for residents of nursing homes,
   board and care homes, assisted living facilities and similar adult care
   facilities. Long-Term Care Ombudsmen advocate on behalf of individuals
   and groups of residents as well as work to effect systems changes. They
   provide an on-going presence in long-term care facilities, monitoring
   care and conditions and providing a voice for those who are unable to
   speak for themselves.

   The Directory of State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Programs is being
   maintained off site at the National Long-Term Care Ombudsman Resource
   Center.  In a few moments, your browser will switch to that site
