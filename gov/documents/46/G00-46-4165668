                                Volcano Watch

   Volcano Watch is a weekly newsletter written by the scientists at the
   US Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. It is published in
   the Hawaii Tribune-Herald's Sunday newspaper and the West Hawai'i
   Today's Monday newspaper, and posted here the following Monday or
   Tuesday. While primarily addressed to the residents of the Big Island
   of Hawai`i, some articles may have a broader scope. Article topics may
   range from volcanic features on the Big Island, volcanic hazards,
   informational topics of Long Valley, Montserrat, or Alaska, to topics
   about the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.

                           Kilauea Eruption Status

   From Volcano Watch, January 24, 2002: The eruption of Kilauea Volcano
   continued unabated at the Pu`u `O`o vent during the past week.
   Intermittent lava activity was observed within the Pu`u `O`o crater on
   January 21 and 22. Lava moves away from the vent toward the ocean in a
   network of tubes. Two major breakouts of the tube system at the
   2,220-ft and 2,080-ft elevations have built small shields topped with
   lava ponds, which supply short surface flows. Other breakouts from the
   tube system supply surface flows on the pali and in the coastal flats.
   Lava is now entering the ocean only at Kamoamoa. The ocean entry east
   of Kupapa`u was found inactive on January 22, and geophysical
   measurements indicate that the feeder tube was empty.

   The public is reminded that the bench of the ocean entry is very
   hazardous, with possible collapses of the unstable new land. The steam
   clouds are extremely hot, highly acidic, and laced with glass
   particles. Swimming at the black sand beaches of the bench can be a
   blistering or even deadly venture.

   One earthquake was reported felt during the week ending on January 24.
   Residents of nearly every district on the island felt the earthquake
   originating from the south flank of Kilauea at 1:18 a.m. on January 18.
   The magnitude-4.1 earthquake was located 11 km (6.6 mi) west of
   Kalapana at a depth of 9.1 km (5.5 mi).

   For maps, photographs, and more current information see Kilauea's
   eruption update page. Visit The Hawaii Center for Volcanology for
   captivating eruptive photos and a history of the eruption.
