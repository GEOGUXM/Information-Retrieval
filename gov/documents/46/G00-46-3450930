   Patents and Licensing

      NASA has three main missions as defined by the Space Act of 1958: 1)
      Aeronautics; 2) Space Flight; and 3) Technology Transfer. NASA's
      Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) transfers its technology, the
      knowledge, and other ideas gained while performing research and
      development in support of space flight to the private sectorÂ‹including
      industry, academia, research organizations, and private entrepreneurs.
