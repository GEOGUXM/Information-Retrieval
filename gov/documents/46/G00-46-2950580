   Dr. Gray's Atlantic Basin Hurricane forecast for 1999

   The most active part of the hurricane season is here! Dr. William Gray,
   a noted hurricane researcher from Colorado State University predicts
   another active season (June 1-November 30) with a total of 14 tropical
   cyclones. Nine are expected to become hurricanes, and of these, four
   are forecast to become major hurricanes (i.e. Cat 3, 4 or 5 with winds
   greater than 110 mph). Seasonal averages for the Atlantic Ocean are 9.3
   tropical storms, 5.8 hurricanes, and 2.2 major hurricanes.

   Dr. Gray makes his preliminary forecasts for each season in November,
   with updates in April, June, and August to reflect observed West
   African rainfall, Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures, upper level
   winds, and surface pressure patterns over the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of
   Mexico, and Caribbean Sea. This year, Dr. Gray and his researchers are
   providing probabilities of hurricane landfalls along the U.S.
   coastline. They give a 54% chance that one or more major hurricanes
   will make landfall along the U.S. East Coast, including peninsular
   Florida. This compares with a 100 year average of 31%.

   The four year period from 1995-98 has been the most active span for
   tropical cyclones in recorded history with 53 named storms, including
   15 major hurricanes . According to researchers at Colorado State
   University, we have already entered a period of increased tropical
   cyclone activity, similar to the period from the 1930's through the
   1960's. Dr. Gray indicates that the increase in the Atlantic
   thermohaline circulation, resulting in warmer sea surface temperature
   anomalies across the Atlantic hurricane basin, may be responsible. He
   expects the next two decades will see increased hurricane activity
   similar to the past four years.

   Includes local weather observations/forecasts & local historical/
   climatological data for southeastern SC & GA.
   Now is the time to make your hurricane plan.

   * Know the hurricane risks in your area.

   * Become familiar with your local hurricane evacuation route(s).

   * Know where local emergency shelters are (even if you plan on
   staying).

   * Devise a family plan of evacuation to a safe area...if ordered to by
   authorities (plan on staying at a motel/shelter).

   * Obtain necessary materials to secure your home.

   * Keep rain gutters and down spouts clear of debris.

   * Determine a safe inland place to store your boat.

   * Review insurance policy & find a safe place for important legal
   documents.

   * Have a good supply of cash on hand since ATMs will not be accessible,
   if there is no power.

   * Fill gallon jugs with enough water per person (5 gallons) for several
   days. The local water supply will likely be polluted.

   * Do not forget a hurricane plan for your pet. Include places of
   shelter and a supply kit.

   * Review the needs and working condition of emergency equipment such as
   flashlights, batteries, and portable radios.

   * Do not wait until the Hurricane /

   tropical storm watch is posted to do important chores such as filling
   up your automobile's gas tank. There may not be service at area
   stations until you get well inland.

   * After a watch is posted for your area, insurance companies will not
   sell policies due to the increased risk...Insure your
   property/valuables now before the next hurricane.

   * Always listen to authorities regarding evacuations. They know the
   dangers of staying in harm's way.

   New Computer Power at The National Weather Service

   As a part of the modernization of The National Weather Service, the
   Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) was installed in
   the Forecast Office in Charleston, South Carolina the last week of
   March 1999. AWIPS is a technologically advanced interactive computer
   system used to process, display, and transmit weather information. It
   is the cornerstone of the modernization and restructuring of the
   National Weather Service (NWS) and will allow the NWS to meet its
   mission "to provide weather and flood warnings, public forecasts, and
   advisories for all of the United States, its territories, adjacent
   coastal and offshore waters, primarily for the protection of life and
   property." Forecasters view large amounts of image, graphic, and
   alphanumeric information from many different sources on a daily basis.
   The AWIPS system will allow the forecasters the means to dissect this
   data in a more organized and user friendly environment.

   The system can combine NEXRAD Doppler radar (WSR-88D) data with
   satellite imagery from the NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental
   Satellites (GOES) and hundreds of observations from the Automated
   Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) often overlaying this data in one
   display to give the forecaster a three dimensional view of the
   atmosphere. Many different fields of model data are also available from
   the weather forecast models which are run on the mainframe computers by
   the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) in Suitland
   Maryland. This is the same computer technology used by several branches
   of NCEP, including the Tropical Prediction Center (TPC) responsible for
   the forecasting of Tropical Cyclones including Hurricanes, and the
   Storm Prediction Center (SPC), which monitors and aids in locating
   those areas that are favorable for spawning severe thunderstorms and
   tornadoes.

   Once the system has been given the final approval by its creators and
   testers, it will be used during severe weather events to issue Severe
   Thunderstorm and Tornado Warnings. The amount of information, and speed
   of viewing the information from a single scan of the radar will be
   dramatically increased. This system is expected to improve the decision
   making process so that forecasters can issue warnings with greater
   confidence and skill with a 6 GB hard drive. The individual
   workstations have either a 3 or 4 GB hard drive. The system remains a
   work in progress and future "builds" of the software will further
   improve AWIPS at the Charleston National Weather Service office. The
   entire system was designed by the Forecast Systems Laboratory in
   Boulder, Colorado which is a sister agency to the National Weather
   Service both of which are a part of the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration. AWIPS recently won top honors on June 7 in
   the Computerworld Smithsonian Awards program in the category of
   Environment, Energy and Agriculture. This award honors organizations
   that use technology in an innovative way to benefit society.

   The Heat Index

   Heat index (HI), also referred to as the apparent temperature, is a
   measure of the contribution humidity makes when high temperatures
   reduce the body's cooling ability. The HI is the temperature the body
   senses based on normal humidity levels. For example, if the actual
   temperature is 100 degrees with 40% relative humidity, the effect of
   this on the body would be the same as 111 degrees with normal humidity
   for that temperature. Refer to the HI chart at right. The National
   Weather Service (NWS) generally issues heat advisories when the index
   reaches 105 degrees for at least two consecutive days.

   In an effort to alert local authorities and the general public, the NWS
   will highlight excessive heat /humidity conditions in its forecasts and
   statements through the release of appropriate safety rules and civil
   emergency messages.

   Ultra-Violet Index

   The National Weather Service issues this daily index for selected
   cities. It describes the next day's peak exposure to UV rays (scale 1 -
   10+ ). This value is broadcast on NOAA weather radio daily.

   Index: Exposure

   0-2 Minimal

   3-4 Low

   5-6 Moderate

   7-9 High

   10+ very high

   A Comparison of Junes in Charleston

   Many folks around the greater Charleston area have commented about how
   much "cooler" it felt this June as compared to June last year. Looking
   at the statistics from Charleston International Airport bears this out.
   The average high temperature in June 1998 was a sweltering 93.2. This
   past June, however, was a full 8 degrees cooler for the highs (85.2).
   Overnight lows were also warm last June, with the average 72.4, while
   June 1999 recorded an average of 67.6. What was astonishing about June
   1998 was the relentless heat combined with high humidities that sent
   heat indices soaring past 110 for several days. A total of 24 days had
   high temperatures of 90 or better in 1998. One of those days hit the
   century mark (30^th). There was a stretch from June 12^th to the 30^th
   where highs were 90 or better. There were only six days in June 1999
   that temperatures reached 90 or better, with the highest reading for
   the month at 91 on three days. Also, record highs were either tied or
   broken on three days in June 1998-99 on the 28^th and 29^th (tied
   records set in 1978 and 1936, respectively), with the 100 on the 30^th
   setting a record for the date (previous 99 set in 1936). No records
   were set in June 1999. Both Junes were dry, with precipitation totals
   falling well below the normal of 6.43".

   Here are the statistics for the last two Junes in Charleston:

   June 1999 June 1998

   Avg. High 85.2 Avg. High 93.2

   Avg. Low 67.6 Avg. Low 72.4

   Monthly Avg. 76.4 Monthly Avg. 82.8

   Depart. from norm -1.9 Depart. from norm +4.5

   Monthly High 91 (3 days) Monthly High 100 (30)

   Monthly Low 60 (1) Monthly Low 53 (8)

   Precip. 2.32" Precip. 3.41"

   Depart. from norm -4.11" Depart. from norm -3.02"

   Rains Return in a Big Way!

   Many sections of the Lowcountry and the Coastal Empire of Georgia have
   had near drought conditions for the last several months (from February
   to June) as high pressure has dominated the area, not allowing for
   springtime storm systems to bring normal rainfall as well as the usual
   development of summertime thunderstorms.

   On June 29^th, the rains returned in a very big way over some areas. An
   area of showers and thunderstorms developed along and just off the
   coast from southern Charleston county to Bryan county Georgia. Multiple
   convergence zones focused on extreme southern South Carolina into
   southeastern Georgia during the mid morning through afternoon.
   Extremely heavy rainfall occurred in a short period of time across that
   region. Severe flooding was reported in the Beaufort and Savannah areas
   as well as other sections of Beaufort, Jasper and Chatham counties. A
   state of emergency was declared in Chatham county, including Savannah,
   through the 30^th. The malls in Savannah were hit hard, and were closed
   as cars floated by in the parking lots. A cooperative observer in
   Hardeeville (southern Jasper county of South Carolina) reported a total
   of 15 inches of rain in about 12 hours. By 2 PM on the 29^th, 11.4
   inches had fallen at DeRenne Station in Savannah, while other parts of
   the city only received two to three inches. Beaufort reported a total
   of 11" in two days (28-29), which included 7.5" in 12 hours on the
   29^th. Savannah Airport received about 10" from June 26^th to July
   1^st, including 6.6" which occurred on the 29^th. According to Doppler
   radar estimates, some areas around southern Jasper and Beaufort
   counties received from 20-25" of rain between June 26^th and July 1^st.
   For more information about the flooding event, the Savannah Morning
   News has a special section on their Internet web site called Savannah
   Now Underwater.

   The Heat is On Across the Lowcountry and Coastal Empire

   Oppressive heat and humidity gripped south coastal South Carolina and
   southeastern Georgia during late July and early August due to a
   stubborn upper level high pressure system that stalled across the
   southern United States from mid July through August 1^st. High
   temperatures in the mid 90s to mid 100s combined with dewpoints in the
   mid 70s to lower 80s to produce dangerous heat index values, especially
   from July 30^th to August 1^st. Heat index readings were in the 115 to
   120 degree range. Record high temperatures were either tied or set,
   including an all time record at Charleston International Airport on
   August 1^st. Beaufort and the downtown Charleston location at the
   Customs House also tied their all time record high temperatures.

   The charts below show the records set and previous records. Records
   that were tied appear in bold italics.

   HURRICANE DENNIS BRUSHES LOWCOUNTRY AND COASTAL EMPIRE

   After a slow start to the 1999 hurricane season, late August erupted
   with a flurry of tropical activity. Three tropical cyclones developed
   at the same time in the Atlantic, including Dennis. Tropical depression
   five developed north of the Greater Antilles on August 23^rd, and moved
   slowly west northwest toward the Bahama Island chain while slowly
   strengthening. On the afternoon of August 24^th, the fourth named
   storm, Dennis, developed. The tropical storm slowly developed reaching
   hurricane strength two days later on August 26^th. Dennis raked the
   northwest Bahamas with hurricane force winds, and continued on a
   westerly track threatening the Florida east coast and both hurricane
   watches and tropical storm warnings were issued on the 27th.

   The National Hurricane Center in Miami anticipated a change in the
   forecast track to northwest, and eventually north, as Dennis came under
   the influence of a large upper level trough across the East Coast, and
   had mentioned that the Carolinas would be most threatened during the
   upcoming days. On the evening of the 28^th, a hurricane watch was
   issued from Savannah, Ga. to Surf City, NC. Tropical storm warnings
   would be issued for the entire South Carolina coast later that night.
   On the evening of the 29^th, the category two hurricane with maximum
   sustained winds of 105 mph came within 110 miles of Charleston, SC.
   Since the Southeast Georgia and Southern South Carolina coasts were on
   the weaker western side of the hurricane, wind and rainfall effects
   were greatly reduced. Tropical storm force wind gusts, 39 to 73 mph,
   were felt along coastal sections of South Carolina, and rainfall was
   generally less than 2 inches across the tri-county area. Dennis
   paralleled the Carolina coast, and became stationary just off the Outer
   Banks of North Carolina while weakening. And now the rest of the story!
   Tropical Storm Dennis, after much meandering around, finally decided to
   make its move into North Carolina, making landfall just east of Cape
   Lookout late in the afternoon of September 4^th.

   As many Lowcountry residents are well aware, it's quite a different
   story experiencing the fringe affects of a category 2 hurricane, than
   experiencing a direct hit by a major hurricane, category 3-5, like
   Hurricane Hugo in 1989. At the time of this writing, the most active
   part of the hurricane season is yet to come. Names of storms like
   Hazel, Gracie, and Hugo will forever remain etched in our minds . Let's
   not let our guard down, remain prepared, as we recall those memorable
   storms made landfall in late September through mid October.
