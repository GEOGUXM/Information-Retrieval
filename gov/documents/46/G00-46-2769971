     all incidents of ownership except legal title (which shall vest in
     the United States), in any structure, fixture, or improvement he
     constructs or locates upon land owned by the United States; and,
     with the approval of the Administration, such possessory interest
     may be assigned, transferred, encumbered, or relinquished by him,
     and, unless otherwise provided by contract, shall not be
     extinguished by the expiration or other termination of the
     concession and may not be taken for public use without just
     compensation;
     (12) with the approval of the President, to enter into cooperative
     agreements under which members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and

     injury, death, or damage to or loss of real or personal property
     resulting from the conduct of the Administration's functions as
     specified in subsection (a) of this section, where such claim is
     presented to the Administration in writing within two years after
     the accident or incident out of which the claim arises; and
     (B) if the Administration considers that a claim in excess of
     $25,000 is meritorious and would otherwise be covered by this
     paragraph, to report the facts and circumstances thereof to the
     Congress for its consideration;  and

     (1) adding at the end thereof the following new section:

     "§ 799. Violation of regulations of National Aeronautics and Space
     Administration

     "Whoever willfully shall violate, attempt to violate, or conspire to
     violate any regulation or order promulgated by the Administrator of
     the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for the protection
     or security of any laboratory, station, base or other facility, or
     part thereof, or any aircraft, missile, spacecraft, or similar
     vehicle, or part thereof, or other property or equipment in the
     custody of the Administration, or any real or personal property or
     equipment in the custody of any contractor under any contract with
     the Administration or any subcontactor of any such contractor, shall
     be fined not more than $5,000, or imprisoned not more than one year,
     or both."
     (2) adding at the end of the sectional analysis thereof the
     following new item:

     "799. Violation of regulations of National Aeronautics and Space
     Administration."

     (d) Section 1114 of title 18 of the United States Code is amended by
     inserting immediately before "while engaged in the performance of
     his official duties" the following:  "or any officer or employee of
     the National Aeronautics and Space Administration directed to guard
     and protect property of the United States under the administration
     and control of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,".
     (e) The Administrator may direct such of the officers and employees
     of the Administration as he deems necessary in the public interest
     to carry firearms while in the conduct of their official duties.
     The Administrator may also authorize such of those employees of the
     contractors and subcontactors of the Administration engaged in the
     protection of property owned by the United States and located at
     facilities owned by or contracted to the United States as he deems
     necessary in the public interest, to carry firearms while in the
     conduct of their official duties.
     (f) Under regulations to be prescribed by the Administrator and
     approved by the Attorney General of the United States, those
     employees of the Administration and of its contractors and
     subcontractors authorized to carry firearms under subsection (e) may
     arrest without warrant for any offense against the United States
     committed in their presence, or for any felony cognizable under the
     laws of the United States if they have reasonable grounds to believe
     that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing such
     felony.  Persons granted authority to make arrests by this
     subsection may exercise that authority only while guarding and
     protecting property owned or leased by, or under the control of, the
     United States under the administration and control of the
     Administration or one of its contractors or subcontractors, at
     facilities owned by or contracted to the Administration.

PROPERTY RIGHTS IN INVENTIONS

     Sec. 305.  (a) Whenever any invention is made in the performance of
     any work under any contract of the Administration, and the
     Administrator determines that--
     (1) the person who made the invention was employed or assigned to
     perform research, development, or exploration work and the invention
     is related to the work he was employed or assigned to perform, or
     that it was within the scope of his employment duties, whether or
     not it was made during working hours, or with a contribution by the
     Government of the use of Government facilities, equipment,
     materials, allocated funds, information proprietary to the
     Government, or services of Government employees during working
     hours; or
     (2) the person who made the invention was not employed or assigned
     to perform research, development, or exploration work, but the
     invention is nevertheless related to the contract, or to the work or
     duties he was employed or assigned to perform, and was made during
     working hours, or with a contribution from the Government of the
     sort referred to in clause (1),
     such invention shall be the exclusive property of the United States,
     and if such invention is patentable a patent therefor shall be
     issued to the United States upon application made by the
     Administrator, unless the Administrator waives all or any part of
     the rights of the United States to such invention in conformity with
     the provisions of subsection (f) of this section.
     (b) Each contract entered into by the Administrator with any party
     for the performance of any work shall contain effective provisions
     under which such party shall furnish promptly to the Administrator a
     written report containing full and complete technical information
     concerning any invention, discovery, improvement, or innovation
     which may be made in the performance of any such work.
     (c) No patent may be issued to any applicant other than the
     Administrator for any invention which appears to the Commissioner of
     Patents  to have significant utility in the conduct of aeronautical
     and space activities unless the applicant files with the
     Commissioner, with the application or within thirty days after
     request therefor by the Commissioner, a written statement executed
     under oath setting forth the full facts concerning the circumstances
     under which such invention was made and stating the relationship (if
     any) of such invention to the performance of any work under any
     contract of the Administration.  Copies of each such statement and
     the application to which it relates shall be transmitted forthwith
     by the Commissioner to the Administrator.
     (d) Upon any application as to which any such statement has been
     transmitted to the Administrator, the Commissioner may, if the
     invention is patentable, issue a patent to the applicant unless the
     Administrator, within ninety days after receipt of such application
     and statement, requests that such patent be issued to him on behalf
     of the United States.  If, within such time, the Administrator files
     such a request with the Commissioner, the Commissioner shall
     transmit notice thereof to the applicant, and shall issue such
     patent to the Administrator unless the applicant within thirty days
     after receipt of such notice requests a hearing before a Board of
     Patent Appeals and Interferences  on the question whether the
     Administrator is entitled under this section to receive such
     patent.  The Board may hear and determine, in accordance with rules
     and procedures established for interference cases, the question so
     presented, and its determination shall be subject to appeal by the
     applicant or by the Administrator to the United States Court of
     Appeals for the Federal Circuit  in accordance with procedures
     governing appeals from decisions of the Board of Patent Appeals and
     Interferences in other proceedings.
     (e) Whenever any patent has been issued to any applicant in
     conformity with subsection (d), and the Administrator thereafter has
     reason to believe that the statement filed by the applicant in
     connection therewith contained any false representation of any
     material fact, the Administrator within five years after the date of
     issuance of such patent may file with the Commissioner a request for
     the transfer to the Administrator of title to such patent on the
     records of the Commissioner.  Notice of any such request shall be
     transmitted by the Commissioner to the owner of record of such
     patent, and title to such patent shall be so transferred to the
     Administrator unless within thirty days after receipt of such notice
     such owner of record requests a hearing before a Board of Patent
     Appeals and Interferences on the question whether any such false
     representation was contained in such statement.  Such question shall
     be heard and determined, and determination thereof shall be subject
     to review, in the manner prescribed by subsection (d) for questions
     arising thereunder.  No request made by the Administrator under this
     subsection for the transfer of title to any patent, and no
     prosecution for the violation of any criminal statute, shall be
     barred by any failure of the Administrator to make a request under
     subsection (d) for the issuance of such patent to him, or by any
     notice previously given by the Administrator stating that he had no
     objection to the issuance of such patent to the applicant therefor.
     (f) Under such regulations in conformity with this subsection as the
     Administrator shall prescribe, he may waive all or any part of the
     rights of the United States under this section with respect to any
     invention or class of inventions made or which may be made by any
     person or class of persons in the performance of any work required
     by any contract of the Administration if the Administrator
     determines that the interests of the United States will be served
     thereby.  Any such waiver may be made upon such terms and under such
     conditions as the Administrator shall determine to be required for
     the protection of the interests of the United States.  Each such
     waiver made with respect to any invention shall be subject to the
     reservation by the Administrator of an irrevocable, nonexclusive,
     nontransferable, royalty-free license for the practice of such
     invention throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States
     or any foreign government pursuant to any treaty or agreement with
     the United States.  Each proposal for any waiver under this
     subsection shall be referred to an Inventions and Contribution Board
     which shall be established by the Administrator within the
     Administration.  Such Board shall accord to each interested party an
     opportunity for hearing, and shall transmit to the Administrator its
     findings of fact with respect to such proposal and its
     recommendations for action to be taken with respect thereto.
     [(g)] deleted
     (h) The Administrator is authorized to take all suitable and
     necessary steps to protect any invention or discovery to which he
     has title, and to require that contractors or persons who retain
     title to inventions or discoveries under this section protect the
     inventions or discoveries to which the Administration has or may
     acquire a license of use.
     (i) The Administration shall be considered a defense agency of the
     United States for the purpose of chapter 17 of title 35 of the
     United States Code.
     (j) As used in this section--
     (1) the term "person" means any individual, partnership,
     corporation, association, institution, or other entity;
     (2) the term "contract" means any actual or proposed contract,
     agreement, understanding, or other arrangement, and includes any
     assignment, substitution of parties, or subcontract executed or
     entered into thereunder; and
     (3) the term "made", when used in relation to any invention, means
     the conception or first actual reduction to practice of such
     invention.
     (k) Any object intended for launch, launched, or assembled in outer
     space shall be considered a vehicle for purpose of section 272 of
     title 35, United States Code.
     (l) The use or manufacture of any patented invention incorporated in
     a space vehicle launched by the United States Government for a
     person other than the United States shall not be considered to be a
     use or manufacture by or for the United States within the meaning of
     section 1498(a) of title 28, United States Code unless the
     Administration gives an express authorization or consent for such
     use or manufacture.

CONTRIBUTIONS AWARDS

     Sec. 306.  (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, the
     Administrator is authorized, upon his own initiative or upon
     application of any person, to make a monetary award, in such amount
     and upon such terms as he shall determine to be warranted, to any
     person (as defined by section 305) for any scientific or technical
     contribution to the Administration which is determined by the
     Administrator to have significant value in the conduct of
     aeronautical and space activities.  Each application made for any
     such award shall be referred to the Inventions and Contributions
     Board established under section 305 of this Act.  Such Board shall
     accord to each such applicant an opportunity for hearing upon such
     application, and shall transmit to the Administrator its
     recommendation as to the terms of the award, if any, to be made to
     such applicant for such contribution.  In determining the terms and
     conditions of any award the Administrator shall take into account--
     (1) the value of the contribution to the United States;
     (2) the aggregate amount of any sums which have been expended by the
     applicant for the development of such contribution;
     (3) the amount of any compensation (other than salary received for
     services rendered as an officer or employee of the Government)
     previously received by the applicant for or on account of the use of
     such contribution by the United States; and
     (4) such other factors as the Administrator shall determine to be
     material.

     (b) If more than one applicant under subsection (a) claims an
     interest in the same contribution, the Administrator shall ascertain
     and determine the respective interests of such applicants, and shall
     apportion any award to be made with respect to such contribution
     among such applicants in such proportions as he shall determine to
     be equitable.  No award may be made under subsection (a) with
     respect to any contribution--
     (1) unless the applicant surrenders, by such means as the
     Administrator shall determine to be effective, all claims which such
     applicant may have to receive any compensation (other than the award
     made under this section) for the use of such contribution or any
     element thereof at any time by or on behalf of the United States, or
     by or on behalf of any foreign government pursuant to any treaty or
     agreement with the United States, within the United States or at any
     other place;
     (2) in any amount exceeding $100,000, unless the Administrator has
     transmitted to the appropriate committees of the Congress a full and
     complete report concerning the amount and terms of, and the basis
     for, such proposed award, and thirty calendar days of regular
     session of the Congress have expired after receipt of such report by
     such committees.

DEFENSE OF CERTAIN MALPRACTICE AND NEGLIGENCE SUITS

     Sec. 307.  (a) The remedy against the United States provided by
     sections 1346(b) and 2672 of title 28, United States Code, for
     damages for personal injury, including death, caused by the
     negligent or wrongful act or omission of any physician, dentist,
     nurse, pharmacist, or paramedical or other supporting personnel
     (including medical and dental technicians, nursing assistants, and
     therapists) of the Administration in the performance of medical,
     dental, or related heALTh care functions (including clinical studies
     and investigations) while acting within the scope of his duties or
     employment therein or therefor shall hereafter be exclusive of any
     other civil action or proceeding by reason of the same subject
     matter against such physician, dentist, nurse, pharmacist, or
     paramedical or other supporting personnel (or the estate of such
     person) whose act or omission gave rise to such action or
     proceeding.
     (b) The Attorney General shall defend any civil action or proceeding
     brought in any court against any person referred to in subsection
     (a) of this section (or the estate of such person) for any such
     injury.  Any such person against whom such civil action or
     proceeding is brought shall deliver within such time after date of
     service or knowledge of service as determined by the Attorney
     General, all process served upon such person or an attested true
     copy thereof to such person's immediate superior or to whomever was
     designated by the Administrator to receive such papers and such
     person shall promptly furnish copies of the pleading and process
     therein to the United States Attorney for the district embracing the
     place wherein the proceeding is brought to the Attorney General and
     to the Administrator.
     (c) Upon a certification by the Attorney General that any person
     described in subsection (a) was acting in the scope of such person's
     duties or employment at the time of the incident out of which the
     suit arose, any such civil action or proceeding commenced in a State
     court shall be removed without bond at any time before trial by the
     Attorney General to the district court of the United States of the
     district and division embracing the place wherein it is pending and
     the proceeding deemed a tort action brought against the United
     States under the provisions of title 28, United States Code, and all
     references thereto.  Should a United States district court determine
     on a hearing on a motion to remand held before a trial on the merits
     that the case so removed is one in which a remedy by suit within the
     meaning of subsection (a) of this section is not available against
     the United States, the case shall be remanded to the State court.
     (d) The Attorney General may compromise or settle any claim asserted
     in such civil action or proceeding in the manner provided in section
     2677 of title 28, United States Code, and with the same effect.
     (e) For purposes of this section, the provisions of section 2680(h)
     of title 28, United States Code, shall not apply to any cause of
     action arising out of a negligent or wrongful act of omission in the
     performance of medical, dental, or related heALTh care functions
     (including clinical studies and investigations).
     (f) The Administrator or his designee may, to the extent that the
     Administrator or his designee deem appropriate, hold harmless or
     provide liability insurance for any person described in subsection
     (a) for damages for personal injury, including death, caused by such
     person's negligent or wrongful act or omission in the performance of
     medical, dental, or related heALTh care functions (including
     clinical studies and investigations) while acting within the scope
     of such person's duties if such person is assigned to a foreign
     country or detailed for service with other than a Federal
     department, agency, or instrumentality or if the circumstances are
     such as are likely to preclude the remedies of third persons against
     the United States described in section 2679(b) of title 28, United
     States Code, for such damage or injury.

INSURANCE AND INDEMNIFICATION

     Sec. 308.  (a) The Administration is authorized on such terms and to
     the extent it may deem appropriate to provide liability insurance
     for any user of a space vehicle to compensate all or a portion of
     claims by third parties for death, bodily injury, or loss of or
     damage to property resulting from activities carried on in
     connection with the launch, operations or recovery of the space
     vehicle.  Appropriations available to the Administration may be used
     to acquire such insurance, but such appropriations shall be
     reimbursed to the maximum extent practicable by the users under
     reimbursement policies established pursuant to section 203(c) of
     this Act.
     (b) Under such regulations in conformity with this section as the
     Administrator shall prescribe taking into account the availability,
     cost and terms of liability insurance, any agreement between the
     Administration and a user of a space vehicle may provide that the
     United States will indemnify the user against claims (including
     reasonable expenses of litigation or settlement) by third parties
     for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property resulting
     from activities carried on in connection with the launch, operations
     or recovery of the space vehicle, but only to the extent that such
     claims are not compensated by liability insurance of the user:
     Provided, That such indemnification may be limited to claims
     resulting from other than the actual negligence or willful
     misconduct of the user.
     (c) An agreement made under subsection (b) that provides
     indemnification must also provide for--
     (1) notice to the United States of any claim or suit against the
     user for the death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to the
     property; and
     (2) control of or assistance in the defense by the United States, at
     its election, of that suit or claim.
     (d) No payment may be made under subsection (b) unless the
     Administrator or his designee certifies that the amount is just and
     reasonable.
     (e) Upon the approval by the Administrator, payments under
     subsection (b) may be made, at the Administrator's election, either
     from funds available for research and development not otherwise
     obligated or from funds appropriated for such payments.
     (f) As used in this section--
     (1) the term "space vehicle" means an object intended for launch,
     launched or assembled in outer space, including the Space Shuttle
     and other components of a space transportation system, together with
     related equipment, devices, components and parts;
     (2) the term "user" includes anyone who enters into an agreement
     with the Administration for use of all or a portion of a space
     vehicle, who owns or provides property to be flown on a space
     vehicle, or who employs a person to be flown on a space vehicle;
     and
     (3) the term "third party" means any person who may institute a
     claim against a user for death, bodily injury or loss of or damage
     to property.

     after publishing notice of the increase in the Federal Register not
     less than 180 days before the increase goes into effect.  The
     Administrator shall make available for public inspection, not later
     than the date of publication of such notice, a complete record of
     any correspondence received by the Administration, and a transcript
     of any meetings in which the Administration participated, regarding
     the proposed increase.
     (D) SAFETY REVIEW REQUIRED BEFORE ADMINISTRATOR PROVIDES
     INSURANCE.The Administrator may not provide liability insurance or
     indemnification under subsection (a) unless the developer
     establishes to the satisfaction of the Administrator that
     appropriate safety procedures and practices are being followed in
     the development of the experimental aerospace vehicle.
     (3) NO INDEMNIFICATION WITHOUT CROSS-WAIVER.Notwithstanding
     subsection (a), the Administrator may not indemnify a developer of
     an experimental aerospace vehicle under this section unless there is
     an agreement between the Administration and the developer described
     in subsection (c).
     (4) APPLICATION OF CERTAIN PROCEDURES.If the Administrator requests
     additional appropriations to make payments under this section, like

     cooperating party and with the related entities of that developer or
     cooperating party under which each party to the waiver agrees to be
     responsible, and agrees to ensure that its own related entities are
     responsible, for damage or loss to its property for which it is
     responsible, or for losses, resulting from any injury or death
     sustained by its own employees or agents, as a result of activities
     connected to the agreement or use of the experimental aerospace
     vehicle.
     (2) LIMITATIONS.
     (A) CLAIMS.A reciprocal waiver under paragraph (1) may not preclude
     a claim by any natural person (including, but not limited to, a
     natural person who is an employee of the United States, the
     developer, the cooperating party, or their respective
     subcontractors) or that natural persons estate, survivors, or
     subrogees for injury or death, except with respect to a subrogee
     that is a party to the waiver or has otherwise agreed to be bound by
     the terms of the waiver.
     (B) LIABIITY FOR NEGLIGENCE.A reciprocal waiver under paragraph (1)
     may not absolve any party of liability to any natural person
     (including, but not limited to, a natural person who is an employee
     of the United States, the developer, the cooperating party, or their
     respective subcontractors) or such a natural persons estate,
     survivors, or subrogees for negligence, except with respect to a
     subrogee that is a party to the waiver or has otherwise agreed to be
     bound by the terms of the waiver.
     (C) INDEMNIFICATION FOR DAMAGES.A reciprocal waiver under paragraph

     persons estate, survivors, or subrogees, for injury or death
     sustained by that natural person as a result of activities connected
     to the agreement or use of the experimental aerospace vehicle.
     (D) WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.A reciprocal waiver under paragraph (1) may
     not relieve the United States, the developer, the cooperating party,
     or the related entities of the developer or cooperating party, of
     liability for damage or loss resulting from willful misconduct.
     (3) EFFECT ON PREVIOUS WAIVERS.Subsection (c) applies to any waiver
