  GENERIC SCRIPTS

   1. From Frank Lucia:

    "This is a coordinated monthly test of the broadcast stations and
   cable systems of your area. Equipment that can quickly warn you during
   emergencies is being tested. If this had been an actual emergency such
   as [INSERT TYPES OF EMERGENCIES THAT MAY OCCUR IN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA),
   official messages would have followed the alert tone. [INSERT STATION
   CALL SIGN OR CABLE SYSTEM NAME] serves the [FCC LOCAL AREA NAME]. This
   concludes this test of the Emergency Alert System."

    Shorter versions when timed with the header, two tone, and EOM can fit
   the RMT into 30 seconds.

    2. Suggestions or reminders from the SECC:

    a. In large FCC Local Areas, the formal Local Area name may have
   little meaning for the listening and viewing public. We suggest,
   instead, that you read/show the names of all of the counties in the
   Local Area. The public can understand that. LP1 and LP2 stations will
   say/show all the counties in the Area; LP stations could state/show
   only those counties their signal serves (if less than the total FCC
   Local Area).

    b. An audio message is not required for the unscheduled weekly test
   required of most EAS terminals. Without any verbiage, the RWT digital
   headers and EOMs take about 8 seconds. Some suggest, however, it is
   good opportunity to explain to the listening audience what the "strange
   sound effects" mean and what they do. One suggestion was that, for TV,
   an animated video of a duck quacking be synched to the three headers,
   followed by the audio and video character generation, and concluding
   again with the duck "quacking" the three EOMs. This introduces a degree
   of humor into the required tests.

    c. Some stations, both public and commercial, are reportedly using
   creative methods to pay for the EAS terminals. Some run PSAs describing
   the new EAS, concluding with a plug for a sponsor. i.e., "This message
   has been made possible as a public service by Zircon Jewelers, 123 Main
   Street." These "plugs" can more than pay for the equipment.

    d. THE EAS CAN'T WARN OF AN EARTHQUAKE. No reliable earthquake warning
   system has been found or adopted by the authorities. Thus the EAS can
   never warn of an earthquake. The EAS might be warranted for warnings
   related to subsequent events following an earthquake.

    e. Broadcasters who must alter their power and/or antenna pattern at
   night are authorized to go to full power/normal pattern during any
   EBS/EAS activation period. This is a little known rule ever since the
   EBS was created.
