   IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
   CIRCUIT Nos. 00-5212, 00-5213 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
   Plaintiff-Appellee, v. MICROSOFT CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellant.
   STATE OF NEW YORK ex rel. ELIOT SPITZER, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellees,
   v. MICROSOFT CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellant. JOINT REPLY OF THE
   SOFTWARE & INFORMATION INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND THE COMPUTER &
   COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTIONS FOR
   LEAVE TO PARTICIPATE AS AMICI CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS The
   Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA) and the Computer &
   Communi- cations Industry Association (CCIA) submit this joint reply to
   Microsoft's renewed effort to govern the flow of argument in this
   Court. Having failed in its first effort to limit public participation
   in the most important antitrust case of this generation, Microsoft
   again seeks to invoke the power of this Court to suppress competing
   viewpoints. Microsoft is not satisfied with the 250 pages of briefing
   it will present this Court through its own briefs and those of
   supporting amici. Although Microsoft consented to the participation of
   both SIIA and CCIA in the Supreme Court, Microsoft asks this Court to
   bar all participation in this case by any amicus that is not both in
   agreement with it and under its control. In the alternative, Microsoft
   asks the Court to confine the rest of the Nation - the business
   community in general, the software industry, software users (including
   CCIA member companies), and academics - to a single 25-page brief. To
   impose such a limit at this stage would frustrate this Court's effort
   to gather information necessary to render a wise decision in this case.
   This Court already has recognized the extraordinary importance of this
   case. In a case of this magnitude and complexity, the limitation on
   amicus participation that Microsoft seeks would guarantee the sort of
   diluted and inadequately explained brief that inevitably results from
   compromises among parties of diverse interests and viewpoints, making
   it significantly less likely that this Court would be aided by the
   brief. This Court properly declined Microsoft's earlier request to
   silence the public in advance, and should do so again. Although the
   amici will make every effort to coordinate and streamline their
   presentations to this Court, the Court should not artificially limit
   public participation in the case at this stage. 1. Microsoft's response
   to the amicus motions reflects its consistent position throughout this
   case with respect to those members of the business community that do
   not accept Microsoft's yoke. Microsoft brands as the captive of
   Microsoft's competitors any organization that disagrees with Microsoft
   on antitrust issues.1/ Microsoft has successfully chilled comment on
   its activities by many independent companies and groups. 1/ Of course,
   any organization whose members include software companies is likely to
   include competitors of Microsoft in some market. Some software
   companies avoid competing with Microsoft only by choosing to become
   Microsoft's vassals, making what Microsoft allows them to make and
   steering clear of product development that might threaten a Microsoft
   product or initiative. As the evidence in this case makes clear,
   Microsoft expects such deference from other industry participants. See,
   e.g., United States v. Microsoft Corp., 84 F. Supp.2d 9, 30-43 (D.D.C.
   1999) (Findings of Fact, ¶¶ 79-132). -2- Not all organizations have
   capitulated, however. CCIA and SIIA are established, broad- based trade
   associations with long-standing policies favoring competition. Both
   groups have demonstrated interests and prior records of involvement in
   this case, and their members have shown a substantial financial
   commitment to their policy positions. SIIA represents a broad
   cross-section of software developers and content providers. Some of
   those firms compete with Microsoft, but many do not. As SIIA pointed
   out in its motion (at 2), SIIA was designated by the United States as
   its supporting amicus curiae at the liability stage in the district
   court. At that time, Microsoft was a member of the SIIA. SIIA has more
   than 1,000 members, who elect its board of directors. As a consequence,
   that board, which comprises representatives of diverse companies, is
   not easily dominated or intimidated by a single member, even one of
   Microsoft's size and market power. The elected board of SIIA decided,
   over Microsoft's opposition, that it was in the interest of competition
   in the software industry to accept the government's invitation. After
   SIIA filed its brief in support of the United States, Microsoft
   withdrew from the organization and induced others to withdraw funding.
   When Microsoft claims that a trade group is "dominated by Microsoft's
   competitors" (Response at 4), Microsoft simply means that it could not
   dissuade the group from criticizing Microsoft. Microsoft's effort to
   pigeonhole CCIA as being "dominated by Microsoft's competitors" is also
   absurd. CCIA includes several software vendors, but also includes large
   users of software products (Microsoft's and others), and thus presents
   a spectrum of vendor and user perspectives. CCIA's members include
   equipment manufacturers, software developers, providers of electronic
   commerce, networking, telecommunications and on-line services,
   resellers, systems integrators, and third-party vendors. Most CCIA
   members are customers of, suppliers to, or partners with Microsoft, or
   have no direct relationship with Microsoft. CCIA has long believed that
   the interests of the -3- computer and communications industries
   coincide with the interests of consumers. CCIA's involvement in
   Microsoft antitrust issues dates from its participation as an amicus
   curiae in the original consent decree case both in the district court
   and in this Court. Indeed, this Court acknowledged the validity of some
   of CCIA's concerns about the narrowness of the original consent decree.
   See United States v. Microsoft, 56 F.3d 1448, 1461-1462 (D.C. Cir.
   1995). 3. Microsoft complains (Response 4) that our prior briefs have
   not only provided legal arguments resting on the controlling antitrust
   decisions of the Supreme Court, but also have supplied additional
   context relevant to the industry and to Microsoft's assertions. A few
   observations may illuminate the source of Microsoft's apprehension at
   our continued participation in this case. First, our participation and
   legal arguments have demonstrated that the antitrust laws can and
   should be applied to ensure competition in the software and Internet
   industry, and that we resist efforts to create what for practical
   purposes would amount to a "software exception" to those laws. Second,
   our prior briefs have used Microsoft's own public statements to
   illustrate the broader significance of the anticompetitive conduct in
   this case, by illuminating Microsoft's efforts to expand the Windows
   monopoly to suppress competition in additional software markets while
   preventing threats to the monopoly itself. Third, although Microsoft
   has labeled our submission to the Supreme Court of the United States as
   "scurrilous," Microsoft v. United States, No. 00-139, Reply Br. 10 n.
   8, it could not say that anything in our brief was untrue, for the good
   reason that the great bulk of the "newspaper articles" that Microsoft
   hopes never come to the attention of this Court quote the public
   statements of Microsoft's executives - often in speeches released by
   Microsoft itself. It is understandable that Microsoft hopes to preserve
   its ability to assert one position in its briefs while asserting the
   opposite to financial and market analysts and the trade press. In
   making critical determinations about the application of the antitrust
   laws to one of the Nation's most important -4- industries, however,
   this Court should be fully aware both of market realities and of
   Microsoft's practical assessment of those realities. 4. CCIA and SIIA
   represent very different sets of companies, with only a few that
   overlap, and have distinctly different areas of expertise. These groups
   have cooperated in two previous briefs in this case, however, and
   expect to do so again in this Court. The perspective of their diverse
   memberships does differ, though, from the views of the parties and of
   other prospective amici in the case. SIIA and CCIA have focused on the
   application of antitrust law in the specific context of the software
   industry and the Internet - the particular questions that arise from
   the nature of software code and of markets defined by the uses of such
   code. SIIA and CCIA also have devoted substantial attention to issues
   of remedy, both the practicalities known to them through experience and
   the implications deriving from the Supreme Court's precedents. Their
   perspective differs in important respects from that of the plaintiffs.
   The perspective of SIIA and CCIA also differs from that of other
   prospective amici with some prior involvement in competitive issues
   relating to Microsoft. The Project to Promote Competition has presented
   the views of Judge Robert Bork - who independently appeared below as an
   amicus supporting the plaintiff States - views that have focused on
   preserving the continuity of antitrust doctrine as it is applied to the
   software markets at issue in this case. By contrast, AOL's interest is
   unique. Having acquired Netscape, AOL is the private party most
   directly affected by the conduct at issue in this case. AOL's separate
   and substantial interest should not detract from the participation of
   the broader constituency represented by SIIA and CCIA.2/ 2/ It would
   appear that Professor Hollaar offers the technical expertise that this
   Court earlier indicated it might find useful. It is ironic that
   Microsoft seeks to bar the courthouse door to a -5- 5. Microsoft's
   desire to regulate argument presented to this Court is remarkable. Not
   only does it ask the Court to exclude the views of all amici favoring
   competitive software markets, but also to exclude from participation
   those amici who support Microsoft's position but are not securely
   within Microsoft's control. Microsoft contends that the only view
   beyond those of the parties that the Court should entertain is the
   brief of two organizations that Microsoft has directly sponsored. That
   brief would be submitted by the "Association for Competitive
   Technology," a group created and funded by Microsoft for the purpose of
   opposing law enforcement in this case, see, e.g., Charles Cooper,
   Microsoft's Best Friend in Washington, ZDNet News, 1998 WL 28812898
   (July 30, 1998); James Grimaldi, Microsoft's Lobbying Largess Pays Off,
   Wash. Post, May 17, 2000, at A1, and the Computing Technology Industry
   Association, a group of retailers whose sudden interest in this case
   apparently derives from a recent and significant special contribution
   submitted by Microsoft. Microsoft's resistance to the participation of
   the Association for Objective Law and the Center for the Moral Defense
   of Capitalism is telling. Microsoft plainly fears any voice it does not
   control. All amici should coordinate and consolidate their
   presentations as much as possible. In a case of this importance,
   however, Microsoft should not be permitted to silence its opponents or
   to choose its friends. professor of computer science at one of the
   leading institutions in that field, when this Court has made clear its
   need for technical expertise. See Notice, Oct. 18, 2000 (proposing
   "review session on the fundamentals of automation"). -6- CONCLUSION For
   the foregoing reasons, as well as those stated in our Motions, the
   Motions of CCIA and SIIA for Leave to File Briefs as Amici Curiae
   should be granted. Dated: October 31, 2000 Respectfully submitted,
