               [enrgycom.gif] Warm-Weather Tips for Your Home
     __________________________________________________________________

   These tips are designed to help you choose effective ways to reduce
   your energy bills. Some measures may not be relevant depending on
   climate, the age of your home and appliances, and past improvements
   made to your home.

   The savings numbers are based on your total summer electric bill.
   Equipment mentioned must be electric powered for estimates to be
   accurate.


   FAST AND FREE

   Cutting back unnecessary energy use is an easy way to reduce energy
   consumption while saving money. Here are some suggestions you can do at
   home, at absolutely no cost to you.

   Turn up your Thermostat

   Set your thermostat to 78 degrees when you are home and 85 degrees or
   off when you are away. Using ceiling or room fans allows you to set the
   thermostat higher because the air movement will cool the room. Always
   take into account health considerations and be sure to drink plenty of
   fluids in warm weather. (Save: 1 - 3% per degree, for each degree the
   thermostat is set above 72 degrees)

   Use your appliances wisely

   To help prevent electricity outages, avoid running your appliances
   during peak hours, --from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. -- or anytime an electricity
   emergency is declared.
     * Do your laundry efficiently by using the warm or cold water setting
       for washing your clothes. Always use cold water to rinse clothes.
       (Save: 4%).
     * Line dry clothes whenever you can. (Save up to 5%)
     * When you need to use the dryer, run full loads, use the
       moisture-sensing setting, and clean the clothes dryer lint trap
       after each use. (save: 0.5%)
     * Conserve energy by running your dishwasher only when it is fully
       loaded, and turn off the dry cycle and air dry dishes instead.
       (save: 1%)

   Operate swimming pool filters and cleaning sweeps efficiently
     * Reduce the operating time of your pool filter and automatic
       cleaning sweep to 4 to 5 hours, and only during off-peak time.
       (Save: 1-2% per hour of reduction)

   Eliminate wasted energy
     * Turn off appliances, lights and equipment when not in use. (Save:
       2%)
     * Unplug electronic devices and chargers when they arent in usemost
       new electronics use electricity even when switched "off." Turn
       computers and printers off at the power strip. (Save: 1-2%)
     * Unplug or recycle that spare refrigerator in the garage if you
       dont really need it. This will save you $150 per year! (Save:
       1020%)


   INEXPENSIVE ENERGY SOLUTIONS

   Make a quick trip to your local hardware store to purchase inexpensive
   energy saving tools and equipment.

   Replace air conditioner filters

   Dirty filters restrict airflow and can cause the system to run longer,
   increasing energy use. Replace filters monthly for maximum benefit.
   (Save: 1-2%)

   Plug your homes leaks

   Weather-strip, seal, and caulk leaky doors and windows, and install
   foam gaskets behind outlet covers. (Save: up to 2%)

   Choose Energy Star^® products
     * Buy Energy Star^® certified table lamps and light fixtures, and
       replace your incandescent light bulbs that are used more than two
       hours per day with Energy Star^® compact fluorescent bulbs. For
       example, install compact fluorescent bulbs in your porch light if
       you leave it on overnight. (Savings: for each bulb youll save 0.2%
       for each hour the bulb operates on a typical day. Therefore,
       replacing an incandescent bulb that burns 10 hours per day will
       save 2%)
     * Buy Energy Star^® certified torchieres. (Save: up to 1% for each
       hour/day that its on)
     * Install an Energy Star^® programmable thermostat. (Save: 1-3%)


   GOOD ENERGY SAVING INVESTMENTS

   Planning to do some remodeling soon? Time to replace old appliances?
   Consider these energy efficiency suggestions when you make purchases.

   Install a whole house fan

   A whole house fan is permanently installed in your attic and draws cool
   air into your home through the windows while forcing hot air out
   through your attic vents. Use after sundown when the outside
   temperature drops below 80 degrees, and in the early morning to cool
   your house and help reduce your air conditioning use. (Save: up to 5%)

   Install window shading

   Install patio covers, awnings, and solar window screens to shade your
   home from the sun. For additional future savings, use strategically
   planted trees, shrubs and vines to shade your home. (Save: 5%)

   Invest in a new air conditioner unit

   If your air conditioner is on the way out, buy an Energy Star^® air
   conditioner. (Save: up to 10%)

   Seal your ducts

   Leaking ductwork accounts for 25% of cooling costs in an average home,
   so have your ducts tested and have any leaks or restrictions repaired
   by a qualified contractor. Note: duct cleaning is not the same as duct
   sealing. (Save: 10 -20%)

   Replace your refrigerator with an Energy Star^® model

   Refrigerators with a top or bottom freezer design can save you an
   additional 2-3% on your bill compared to a side-by-side design. (Save:
   10%)

   Increase attic insulation

   If existing insulation level is R-19 or less, consider insulating your
   attic to at least R-30. (Save: 10%)

   Install Energy Star^® windows

   If your windows are due for replacement, Energy Star^® windows can make
   your house more comfortable year-round. (Save: up to 10%)
