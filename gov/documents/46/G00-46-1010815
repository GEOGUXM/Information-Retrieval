   Meteor Watching, Just Do It!
   by NASA KID Danny Stricker [leonids66.jpg]

   December 7, 2001 -  If you want to check out the stars at night, look
   into your local astronomy clubs. I heard about the Leonids meteor
   shower coming up so I wrote to the San Diego Astronomer's Association
   to see if they knew a good place to watch.

   They were really helpful and told me to come on out to their place,
   called Tierra del sol in the desert outside San Diego. Tierra del sol
   means "land of the sun" in Spanish. But at night even the land of the
   sun is very, very dark. It's way out away from the lights of the city,
   which is the best way to see stars. Your eyes get adjusted to the low
   level of lights so you can see better. We had to turn off our
   headlights when we drove in to the site and then we put red plastic on
   our interior car lights so we wouldn't bother anyone. We walked around
   with red plastic flashlights and visited with members of the
   association.

   What causes a meteor shower?
   We got started around midnight since the showers were expected to be
   best late. There were some clouds at first but they started to break up
   and then the show started. It was amazing. The meteors came about every
   ten minutes at first and then sometimes they came a bunch at a time.

   The Leonids come every 33 years and this time was really good because
   the moon wasn't out. Next time they think it won't be that good, in
   fact they think this is the best until the year 2099.

   Many of the members had telescopes set up and were very nice about
   showing you their equipment. We got to see Saturn with its rings on one
   telescope. So find out if your area has an astronomy club!



   The next meteor shower is the Geminids on December 13th.  So, plan your
   viewing times!
