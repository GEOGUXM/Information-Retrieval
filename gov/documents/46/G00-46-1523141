   INTRODUCTION

   The last interglacial period has been cited as a possible analog for a
   future climate under an increased-CO[2] greenhouse warming. Previous
   studies have shown that during the last interglacial CO[2]
   concentrations in the atmosphere were relatively high (see Fig. 1)
   temperatures may have been higher than the present, and sea level may
   have been ~6 m higher (see Fig. 2). The ultimate goals of the LITE
   project are to (1) develop an accurate estimate of the duration of the
   last interglacial period, with improved understanding of its primary
   cause or causes, and (2) using the geologic record, reconstruct the
   climate of the last interglacial period in the U.S. Both of these goals
   are intended to provide a basis for improvement of atmospheric general
   circulation models (AGCMs) that are critical for modeling of future
   climate.

   PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY

   The overall project objectives are to: (1) determine the precise timing
   of the last interglacial period, (2) reconstruct the last interglacial
   climate of the U.S., including Alaska, and (3) compare the
   paleoclimate, derived from the geologic record, of the last
   interglacial with several AGCM reconstructions of this paleoclimate.

   The timing of the last interglacial period is determined from precise
   TIMS U-series dating of emergent marine terrace and reef corals. Less
   precise timing of the last interglacial period for continental interior
   localities is determined through a combination of minimum-limiting
   radiocarbon ages, thermoluminescence dating, and ^10Be dating.
   Paleotemperature reconstruction of coastal waters around the U.S.
   during the last interglacial is accomplished through oxygen isotope
   analyses of last interglacial mollusks and/or corals collected from
   emergent terraces and reefs. Climate of the continental interior of the
   U.S. and Alaska is reconstructed from transects of last interglacial
   soils found in thick loess sections that occur across modern
   temperature and precipitation gradients. Because soil properties are in
   part a function of climate and vegetation, modern soil geography is a
   function of modern climatology and biogeography (see Fig. 3: map of
   modern North American vegetation). By analogy, last-interglacial soil
   geography is a function of last interglacial paleoclimate and
   paleobiogeography. Soil properties most closely linked to climate and
   vegetation are morphology, clay content, mineralogy, chemistry,
   magnetic properties, and carbon isotopic composition of organic matter.

   POTENTIAL IMPACTS

   At present, precise climate forecasting is not possible, but may be
   accomplished in a broad way with AGCMs. These models are continually
   being refined, in part by means of testing simulated climates of the
   past with geologic reconstructions. The last interglacial period is the
   most recent warm interval that may have been significantly warmer than
   today's climate; therefore, it is a critical time period for testing of
   AGCMs. Several AGCMs have been used to reconstruct this period, but
   there are few geologic records that synthesize the last interglacial
   period. This project will have its greatest impact in the climate
   modeling community, where the AGCM reconstructions of the last
   interglacial can be compared to the geologic record of this period.
