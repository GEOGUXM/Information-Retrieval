   Go to Question 1 If I want to export an EAR99 item to a previously
   listed Indian or Pakistani entity, do I need to submit a license
   application?
   Go to Question 2 Prior to the lifting of sanctions, BXA denied a
   license application for EAR99 items intended for export to a listed
   entity. That entity is no longer listed. Can I ship those same items
   without a license now?
   Go to Question 3 How will BXA process my license application if I
   submit a license to export an EAR99 item to an entity that is no longer
   listed on the Entity List?
   Go to Question 4 I want to export missile technology-controlled items
   or nuclear proliferation-controlled items to India and Pakistan. Am I
   permitted to do so?
   Go to Question 5 What license exceptions are now available for exports
   to India and Pakistan?

   Go to Question 6 BXA has identified subordinates for several listed
   entities while others have no subordinates listed. Furthermore, atomic
   energy facilities are not specifically identified. What does this mean?
     __________________________________________________________________

   1. If I want to export an EAR99 item to a previously listed Indian or
   Pakistani entity, do I need to submit a license application?

   The removal of entities from the Entity List effective October 1, 2001,
   eliminates the license requirement in Supplement No. 4 to Part 744 for
           exports and reexports of EAR99 items to those entities.

    It should be noted, however, that the removal of Indian and Pakistani
    entities from the Entity List does not relieve any exporters of their
   standard obligation to know their customers. Under Part 744 of the EAR,
      an export license is required even when it would not otherwise be
    necessary, if an exporter knows, has reason to know, or is otherwise
     informed by BXA that the item will be used in activities related to
    nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons, or missile delivery systems
   as described in part 744. BXA strongly urges the use of Supplement No.
   3 to part 732 of the EAR, "BXA's 'Know Your Customer' Guidance and Red
        Flags," when exporting or reexporting to India and Pakistan.

   2. Prior to the lifting of sanctions, BXA denied a license application
   for EAR99 items intended for export to a listed entity. That entity is
    no longer listed. Can I ship those same items without a license now?

   As set forth above, with the October 1 revisions to the Entity List, a
         license for export to formerly-listed entities is no longer
    automatically required, even where a previous license application for
    the same item was denied. . However, as explained above, if you know,
    have reason to know, or are informed that the item you now intend to
      export to the previously listed entity will be used in activities
   related to nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, or missile delivery
   systems, as described in part 744, a license continues to be required.

   3. How will BXA process my license application if I submit a license to
      export an EAR99 item to an entity that is no longer listed on the
                                Entity List?

    BXA will review an application for the export or reexport of an EAR99
   item to a previously listed entity like entities never listed under the
          license review polices set forth in part 744 of the EAR.

     4. I want to export missile technology-controlled items or nuclear
   proliferation-controlled items to India and Pakistan. Am I permitted to
                                   do so?

     On September 22, 2001, President Bush waived the "Glenn Amendment"
        sanctions that apply to dual-use items controlled for nuclear
     nonproliferation (NP) and missile technology (MT) reasons that were
   placed on India and Pakistan after the 1998 nuclear tests. A license to
       export MT- and NP-controlled items to these countries is still
      required; however the license review policy of denial was changed
     (effective October 1, 2001) to a policy of case-by-case review. The
   case-by-case review policy also applies to MT- and NP-controlled items
                             to listed entities.

    License exceptions may be used for eligible exports (see Part 740 of
    the EAR), but note that most license exceptions are not available for
                            MT- controlled items.

   License applicants should provide documentation to explain the proposed
                                  end use.

    5. What license exceptions are now available for exports to India and
                                  Pakistan?

    The October 1 rule restores the use of applicable license exceptions
      for MT and NP items to non-listed Indian and Pakistani end users.
   Exporters should carefully review the conditions for license exceptions
    in part 740 of the EAR before exporting under a license exception for
                               NP or MT items.

    6. BXA has identified subordinates for several listed entities while
       others have no subordinates listed. Furthermore, atomic energy
      facilities are not specifically identified. What does this mean?

     Two general rules apply with regard to the listing of subordinates:

     1. If subordinates for a listed entity are not specifically named on
     the list, ALL subordinates of that entity are listed.

     Example:

     India Rare Earths: no subordinates are specifically named, therefore
     ALLof its subordinates are listed.

     If subordinates for a listed entity are not specifically on the
     list, but specified end-uses are, any subordinate engaged in such
     specified end-use is listed.

     2. If specific subordinates are identified on the list,
     non-identified subordinates are not listed.

     Example:

     Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO): Four
     subordinate entities are specifically named, therefore other DRDO
     subordinates are not listed.

     Similarly, for entries that identify types of end-users - i.e.,
     nuclear reactor, fuel reprocessing, enrichment or heavy water
     production facilities or their collocated ammonia plants - if the
     intended end-user is one of these types of facilities, then it is a
     listed entity.
