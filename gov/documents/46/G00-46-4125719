   Introduction
   Unfolding Jupiter's Mysteries
   The history of Jupiter exploration began with the invention of the
   telescope in the early seventeenth century. The first telescopes were
   not very powerful, and the views were not very sharp. But over the next
   three hundred years, the telescope was continually improved, and became
   our primary tool for observing the stars and planets.

   This view of Jupiter was recorded using an infrared detector

   Human explorers have taken dangerous journeys to the far corners of
   Earth and even to the Moon. But to explore the outer reaches of the
   solar system, we send spacecraft equipped with cameras and scientific
   instruments. In a way, we send extensions of ourselves on these
   missions. The cameras becomes our "eyes" to view the other planets up
   close. Special instruments "see" in infrared, ultraviolet, and other
   wavelengths of light --- revealing what is invisible to our eyes.

                                                The Hubble Space Telescope

   Today, we have very large and powerful telescopes. The Hubble Space
   Telescope, orbiting above Earth's atmosphere, can see far into space.
   Yet, the planets of our Solar System still hold many mysteries to
   investigate. NASA's first planetary missions were "fly-bys." The
   spacecraft simply zoomed by a planet taking pictures or gathering data,
   and then continued on --- out into deep space.

   But orbiting a planet gives us a chance to learn a great deal more
   about it. The Viking orbiters at Mars and the Magellan orbiter at Venus
   studied planets in the inner solar system. Galileo is the first
   spacecraft to orbit Jupiter in the outer solar system.
