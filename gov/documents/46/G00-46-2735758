DATABASES



   ORI conducts studies related to research integrity and research
   misconduct either through its staff or through contractors. Some
   studies are based on data ORI regularly collects from institutions
   doing research supported by the Public Health Service (PHS) or on
   information received in handling research misconduct cases; others are
   based on surveys of principal investigators and institutions conducting
   PHS supported research conducted by contractors. Several studies have
   been completed; several others are in progress. ORI hopes the research
   community will utilize the data collected in these studies in
   responsible conduct of research education programs, research,
   discussions, and publications.
