Privacy Act Notice

   For site management, information is collected for statistical purposes.
   The Department of State Foreign Affairs Network uses software programs
   to create summary statistics for such purposes as assessing what
   information is of most and least interest or identifying system
   performance or problem areas. The following is the type of information
   collected about your visit to our web site: the name of the Internet
   domain from which you access State Department web sites (for example,
   "aol.com" if you would be connecting from America Online) and the date
   and time you access our site. If you choose to provide us with personal
   information in an email message, we use it only to respond to your
   email.

   For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
   available to all users, the State Department uses software programs to
   monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or
   change information or otherwise cause damage. Unauthorized attempts to
   upload information or change information on this service are strictly
   prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
   of 1986. Information also may be used for authorized law enforcement
   investigations. Except for the above purposes, no other attempts are
   made to identify individual users or their usage habits.

Cookie Disclaimer

   This site does not use cookies.

Search Disclaimer

   This search is based upon locating specified words in the electronic
   text of documents. The text of the original paper documents is
   converted to electronic text through optical character recognition
   (OCR). Because of age and repeated duplication, the condition of some
   paper documents is poor. In those cases, OCR may not recognize certain
   characters and words correctly. Please keep this in mind when using
   full text search, as these inaccuracies may decrease your chance of
   finding all relevant documents for your search criteria.

Private Use of Government Information:

   The private sector may download government information that is in the
   public domain and provide enhancements or "added value." We encourage
   private sector initiatives to further disseminate government
   information. However, we caution users that the "official" version is
   the version which appears on government web sites. Please be aware that
   government information on private sector web sites may not necessarily
   be as up to date and that the "value added" information is not provided
   by the government.

Computer Fraud and Abuse Act:

   Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on
   these web sites are strictly prohibited and punishable under the
   Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.
