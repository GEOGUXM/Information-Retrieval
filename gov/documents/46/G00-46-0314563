   [ERpic.jpg] During 1997 environmental external radiation exposure rates
   were measured along the Columbia River shoreline and at numerous
   perimeter locations to assess the rate of exposure from Hanford Site
   operations. External radiation is defined as radiation originating from
   a source external to the body. It is predominately measured by
   thermoluminescent dosimeters. A dosimeter is a device that is
   constructed of material that can be analyzed to determine the exposure
   the material has to ionizing radiation. In 1998, dosimeter results
   ranged from 71 millirem, average in distant communities, to 93
   millirem, average of all shoreline dosimeters.

   Additional information on external radiation surveillance is available
   in the Hanford Site 2000 Environmental Report, Section 4.6.
