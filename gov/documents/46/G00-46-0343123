                        Coastal Services Center (CSC)

   For the coastal resource management community, there is a vast array of
   new technology that can bring a tremendous amount of previously
   unavailable information to the decision maker's table. Deciding how to
   harness the new technology and the information it brings is a daunting
   task. The role of the NOAA Coastal Services Center is to bridge this
   gap between technology and the coastal manager.

      The Center's Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) Program uses
      satellite imagery to determine land-use change over time.

   To accomplish its mission, the Center provides state programs with
   services and information and helps states take advantage of technology
   that is new or perhaps under-utilized. Geographic information systems
   (GIS), the World Wide Web, and satellite imagery are just a few of the
   tools that are employed. A coastal management fellowship program,
   training opportunities, and a bi-monthly magazine about the coastal
   resource management community are examples of the services provided.

   Each year the Coastal Services Center has at least 100 ongoing projects
   with federal, state, and local partners. "National in scope, local in
   approach" is the theme of each of these efforts. The Center works to
   help states resolve coastal issues, and the lessons learned from each
   project are then communicated to other coastal communities. The Center
   focuses on themes identified as important to the coastal resources
   management community: hazards, habitat, and data access and usability.

  Mission:

          To foster and sustain the environmental and economic well-being of the
          coast by linking people, information, and technology.

   Organizationally unique within NOAA, the Center is composed of
   personnel from throughout the agency, and benefits from a stream of
   talent from other agencies, universities, nonprofit organizations, the
   private sector, and state natural resource management authorities. The
   annual operating plan is developed as a joint effort of NOAA's line
   offices, and signed by all five assistant administrators.
   Collaboration, partnership building, and an orientation toward
   customers and results are the cornerstones of the Coastal Services
   Center.

   The Coastal Services Center is made up of four divisions including:
   Coastal Information Services, Resource Management Services, Coastal
   Technology Services and Coastal Management Services.
