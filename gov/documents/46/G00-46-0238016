   Meteorites from Antarctica are a relatively recent resource for study
   of the material formed early in the solar system; most are thought to
   come from asteroids but some may have originated on larger planets. In
   1969, the Japanese discovered concentrations of meteorites in
   Antarctica. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in
   the last one million years. They seem to be concentrated in places
   where the flowing ice, acting as a conveyor belt, runs into an obstacle
   and is worn away, leaving behind the meteorites. Compared with
   meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic
   meteorites are relatively well preserved. The collection and curation
   of Antarctic meteorites is a cooperative effort among NASA, the
   National Science Foundation and the Smithsonian Institution. The
   meteorites are collected by NSF science teams camping on the ice. Since
   1977, the still-frozen meteorites have been returned to Johnson Space
   Center for curation and distribution. Some of the specimens are
   forwarded to the Smithsonian Institution, but JSC scientists curate
   over 4000 meteorites for more than 250 scientists worldwide and eagerly
   await the arrival of the several hundred new meteorites each year.

                   Mars Meteorite Subdividing a Meteorite

   This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of
   the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites
   relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare
   meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted
   off the Moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. Because meteorites in
   space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the
   metoerite impacted the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies.
   The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a
   meteorite represents additional information that might be useful in
   environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.
