Welcome

   to the CDF Run II Data Handling Subgroup. This page contains a
   description of the project. It also contains design information for
   various components and has status information of the data handling
   system. There are reports on performance also.
   Data Handling is one of the CDF Run II computing subgroups.
   A subpage contains a list of people working in the group and has e-mail
   distribution lists relating to the project.

Project Description

   Data handling for CDF Run II will be sequential files based on the ROOT
   file format.
   The data handling system will archive RAW data files and serve them to
   the production system(s) upon request. Data are organized and
   catalogued by dataset and run section, with all events of a dataset and
   run section being in the same file. Reconstruction data will be picked
   up at the production system, archived, and made accessible to the
   analysis systems in about 50 primary datasets. Physics groups are
   expected to define secondary datasets that will be catalogued in the
   data handling system.

Project Scope

   The scope encompasses both hardware and software, i.e. computer systems
   for offline analysis of data, and software methods for access to the
   data. Design and assembly of the computer cluster is included. Design
   and construction of software methods to access the data on shared disk
   and in the tape archive is also included. The computer cluster also
   needs advanced networks, and a sub-system to archive raw data.

Project Structure

   The project has four sub-divisions:
     * CDF Data Catalogue
     * Central Analysis System
     * Resource Management
     * Mass Storage System Interface

   Others added later are:
     * Archiving of online data streams
     * Input and output of data to production farm
     * Input and output modules for user's analysis framework
     * Initial setup and operation of Look areas for detector data

Project Status

     * DH Reviews of September and November 2001. This site is also a
       TUTORIAL FOR THOSE NEW TO DATA HANDLING.
     * Minutes of Data Handling meetings (Wednesdays of ON weeks, 9am -
       10am, CDF Pump Room).
