   The 96th was first chartered in the Ohio Wing of Civil Air Patrol back
   in 1978. Originally stationed at Youngstown Air Force Base, SQD 301 (as
   it was then known) moved to the city of Akron in 1983.

   After the construction of the NASA space shuttle, the unit was renamed
   the Challenger Composite SQD. In 1998, the unit was finally
   redesignated the 96th Composite SQD after the restructuring of Ohio
   Wing. The squadron is now stationed at the National Guard Armory in
   Stow, Ohio.

   The 96th is chartered as a composite squadron to serve both members of
   the Officer and Cadet programs. This web site is not only a source for
   visitors who wish to learn more about the Civil Air Patrol, but also
   serves as a resource for unit members on specific squadron and CAP
   program information.

   We welcome you to explore this site and are more than pleased to answer
   any questions you may have about the unit and/or Civil Air Patrol.
