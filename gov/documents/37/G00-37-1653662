The E-Line The U.S. Capitol

   Congressman Gil Gutknecht
   January 25, 2002

   Dear Friends,

   The House of Representatives reconvened at noon Wednesday of this past
   week.  This marked the beginning of the second session of the 107th
   Congress.  I look forward to a very productive year.

   As I have mentioned before, this session will be a time of clean up.
   The House accomplished its work in key areas such as agriculture,
   economic security, energy and prescription drugs.  The Senate needs to
   act.  I will be working to clean up the legislative plate so that
   Minnesotans will begin to realize the benefits of sound federal policy.

   [audio2.jpg] As a member of the Budget committee, I was immediately
   involved in the review of the projections by the Congressional Budget
   Office.  CBO Director Dan Crippen confirmed what I had suspected; the
   recession and war caused the budget to sink into the red.  Crippen
   said, " . . . over 70% of (FY2002 surplus reduction) results from the
   weak economy and related technical factors."  CBO said bipartisan tax
   relief resulted in less than 12% of the surplus decline in FY 2002.

   Our response to the events of September 11 has been swift and sure.
   However, they do bear a financial cost.  We must accomplish our goals
   in the War on Terrorism and be willing to adequately fund those
   efforts.  The federal budget may detour briefly into deficit, but if we
   control federal spending, we will get back on track.

   Prioritizing spending demands is always challenging.  As a member of
   the Budget committee I am used to saying 'no' and I will continue to do
   so.  I believe that the federal budget should not increase faster than
   the American family budget.  I will do my part to control federal
   spending on nonessential matters during this important time of national
   security.  Budget committee analysis indicates we can be back on track
   by as early as 2004 with disciplined spending control.

   Also this week, the House passed bipartisan legislation to keep the
   interest rates on college student loans at their current and
   unprecedented low levels. This legislation helps to make the dream of
   obtaining a college education easier to obtain.

   The bipartisan legislation will assist the more than nine million U.S.
   students who need the help of loans to attend college.  Congress
   reduced interest rates on student loans last July to their lowest level
   in history.  Today's vote will extend this low rate to 2006, and then
   set a fixed interest rate of 6.8 percent for student loans and 7.9
   percent for parent loans.

   Our efforts in the War on Terrorism continue.  We are following every
   lead to bring al Qaeda members to justice.  We are also in the midst of
   processing hundreds of detainees from Afghanistan.  Some have asked
   about the status of these individuals.

   All detainees are being provided three appropriate meals a day, medical
   care, clothing, shelter, warm showers, and the opportunity to worship.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross is being allowed to visit
   each detainee privately.  We are building enclosed, long-term
   facilities to house the detainees.

   We must not forget that these individuals are extremely dangerous and
   must be handled accordingly.

   This week President Bush also signed the Victims of Terrorism Tax
   Relief Act -- bipartisan legislation that provides significant tax
   relief to the families of victims of terrorism.  The legislation will
   help the victims of September 11, the Oklahoma City bombing and the
   recent anthrax attacks.

   Next week President Bush will deliver his State of the Union Address
   Tuesday, January 29 at 8:00 p.m. CST.  I encourage you to watch or
   listen to the address.  In his first address to the Joint Session of
   Congress on February 27, 2001, President Bush said, "America today is a
   nation with great challenges, but greater resources."  Through our year
   of adversity we have proven this to be true.  Our greatest resource,
   the American spirit, has carried this nation through.

   I am also enthused about the possibility of Commander Meding from the
   German Naval Ship Lutjens being among those recognized Tuesday night.
   Commander Meding will be my guest in the House gallery during the
   Address.  If you have not yet read the story of the Lutjens, please
   visit it by clicking here.  This is a compelling story that
   demonstrates the unity and support of our allies following the
   September 11 attacks.  We are not alone. Congressman Gutknecht with
   Commerce Secretary Don Evans

   More next week,

   Gil Gutknecht
   Member of Congress
