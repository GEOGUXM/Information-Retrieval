Section 2.1   Characteristics of Synchrotron Radiation

   [OrangeBar.gif]

   Kwang-Je Kim

   Synchrotron radiation occurs when a charge moving at relativistic
   speeds follows a curved trajectory. In this section, formulas and
   supporting graphs are used to quantitatively describe characteristics
   of this radiation for the cases of circular motion (bending magnets)
   and sinusoidal motion (periodic magnetic structures).

   We will first discuss the ideal case, where the effects due to the
   angular divergence and the finite size of the electron beam—the
   emittance effects—can be neglected.

A.    BENDING MAGNETS

   The angular distribution of radiation emitted by electrons moving
   through a bending magnet with a circular trajectory in the horizontal
   plane is given by

   [[Sec2101.gif] ]             ^(1)



   where


   Š[B]   =  photon flux (number of photons per second)

   q    =  observation angle in the horizontal plane

   y   =  observation angle in the vertical plane

   a    =  fine-structure constant

   g    =  electron energy/m[e]c^2 (m[e] = electron mass, c = velocity of
   light)

   w   =  angular frequency of photon (e = Ów = energy of photon)

   I     =  beam current

   e    =  electron charge = 1.602 ´ 10^–19 coulomb

   y    =  w/w[c] = e/e[c ]

   w[c]  =  critical frequency, defined as the frequency that divides the
   emitted power into equal halves,
   = 3g^3c/2r

   r    =  radius of instantaneous curvature of the electron trajectory
   (in practical units,
   r[m] = 3.3 E[GeV]/B[T])

   E    =  electron beam energy

   B    =  magnetic field strength

   e[c]   =  Ów[c] (in practical units,
   e[c] [keV] = 0.665 E^2 [GeV] B[T])

   X    =  gy

   x    =  y(1 + X^2)^3/2/2


   The subscripted K’s are modified Bessel functions of the second kind.
   In the horizontal direction (y = 0), Eq. (1) becomes

   [[Sec2102.gif] ]                        (2)


   where

   In practical units [photons·s^–1·mr^–2·(0.1% bandwidth)^–1],

   [[Sec2104.gif] ]


   The function H[2](y) is shown in Fig. 2-1.

   photon energy to critical photon energy.

   [[Sec2109.gif] ]


   The function G[1](y) is also plotted in Fig. 2-1.

   Radiation from a bending magnet is linearly polarized when observed in
   the bending plane. Out of this plane, the polarization is elliptical
   and can be decomposed into its horizontal and vertical components. The
   first and second terms in the last bracket of Eq. (1) correspond,
   respectively, to the intensity of the horizontally and vertically
   polarized radiation. Figure  2-2 gives the normalized intensities of
   these two components, as functions of emission angle, for different
   energies. The square root of the ratio of these intensities is the
   ratio of the major and minor axes of the polarization ellipse. The
   sense of the electric field rotation reverses as the vertical
   observation angle changes from positive to negative.

   Synchrotron radiation occurs in a narrow cone of nominal angular width
   ~1/g. To provide a more specific measure of this angular width, in
   terms of electron and photon energies, it is convenient to introduce
   the effective rms half-angle s[y] as follows:

   [[Sec2110.gif] ]                              (6)

   polarization components, as functions of the vertical observation angle

   where s[y] is given by

   [[Sec2113.gif] ]                     (7)


   The function C(y) is plotted in Fig. 2-3. In terms of s[y], Eq. (2) may
   now be rewritten as

   [[Sec2114.gif] ]                                 (2a)


B.    PERIODIC MAGNETIC STRUCTURES

   In a wiggler or an undulator, electrons travel through a periodic
   magnetic structure. We consider the case where the magnetic field B
   varies sinusoidally and is in the vertical direction:

   B(z) = B[0] cos(2pz/l[u])
   ,                                                    (8)


   where z is the distance along the wiggler axis, B[0] the peak magnetic
   field, and l[u] the magnetic period. Electron motion is also sinusoidal
   and lies in the horizontal plane. An important parameter characterizing
   the electron motion is the deflection parameter K given by

   [[Sec2115.gif] ]              (9)

   In terms of K, the maximum angular deflection of the orbit is d = K/g.
   For [[Sec2116.gif] ], radiation from the various periods can exhibit
   strong interference phenomena, because the angular excursions of the
   electrons are within the nominal 1/g radiation cone; in this case, the
   structure is referred to as an undulator. In the case K >> 1,
   interference effects are less important, and the structure is referred
   to as a wiggler.

B.1   Wiggler radiation

   In a wiggler, K is large (typically [[Sec2117.gif] ]) and radiation
   from different parts of the electron trajectory adds incoherently. The
   flux distribution is then given by 2N (where N is the number of magnet
   periods) times the appropriate formula for bending magnets, either Eq.
   (1) or Eq. (2). However, r or B must be taken at the point of the
   electron’s trajectory tangent to the direction of observation. Thus,
   for a horizontal angle q,

   [[Sec2118.gif] ]                                  (10)

   where

   e[cmax ]= 0.665 E^2[GeV] B[0][T]   .


   When y = 0, the radiation is linearly polarized in the horizontal
   plane, as in the case of the bending magnet. As y increases, the
   direction of the polarization changes, but because the elliptical
   polarization from one half-period of the motion combines with the
   elliptical polarization (of opposite sense of rotation) from the next,
   the polarization remains linear.

B.2   Undulator radiation

   In an undulator, K is moderate ([ [Sec2119.gif] ]) and radiation from
   different periods interferes coherently, thus producing sharp peaks at
   harmonics of the fundamental (n = 1). The wavelength of the fundamental
   on axis (q = y = 0) is given by

   [[Sec2120.gif] ]
   (11)

   or

   [[Sec2121.gif] ]

   The corresponding energy, in practical units, is


   [[Sec2122.gif] ]

   The relative bandwidth at the nth harmonic is

   [[Sec2123.gif] ]                     (12)


   On axis the peak intensity of the nth harmonic is given by



   [[Sec2124.gif] ][,]      [(13)]



   where

   [[Sec2125.gif] ]        [(14)]






   Here, the J’s are Bessel functions. The function F[n](K) is plotted in
   Fig. 2-4. In practical units [photons·s^–1·mr^–2·(0.1% bandwidth)^–1],
   Eq. (13) becomes


   [[Sec2126.gif] ]



   The angular distribution of the nth harmonic is concentrated in a
   narrow cone whose half-width is given by

   [[Sec2127.gif] ]                               (15)

   Fig. 2-4.    The function F[n](K) for different values of n, where K is
   the deflection parameter.

   Here L is the length of the undulator (L = Nl[u]). Additional rings of
   radiation of the same frequency also appear at angular distances


   [[Sec2129.gif] ]         (16)


   The angular structure of undulator radiation is illustrated in Fig. 2-5
   for the limiting case of zero beam emittance.


   We are usually interested in the central cone. An approximate formula
   for the flux integrated over the central cone is

   [[Sec2130.gif] ]

                                 (17)

   or, in units of photons·s^–1·(0.1% bandwidth)^–1,


   [[Sec2131.gif] ]


   The function Q[n](K) = (1 + K^2/2)F[n]/n is plotted in Fig. 2-6.
   Equation (13) can also be written as



                                [Sec2155.jpg]

   radiation for the limiting case of zero beam emittance. The x and y
   axes correspond to the observation angles q and y (in radians),
   respectively, and the z axis is the intensity in photons·s^–1·A^–1·(0.1
   mr)^–2·(1% bandwidth)^–1. The undulator parameters for this theoretical
   calculation were N = 14, K = 1.87, l[u] = 3.5 cm, and E = 1.3 GeV.

   Away from the axis, there is also a change in wavelength: The factor (1
   + K^2/2) in Eq. (11) must be replaced by [1 + K^2/2 + g^2 (q^2 + y^2)].
   Because of this wavelength shift with emission angle, the
   angle-integrated spectrum consists of peaks at l[n ]superposed on a
   continuum. The peak-to-continuum ratio is large for K << 1, but the
   continuum increases with K, as one shifts from undulator to wiggler
   conditions.

B.3   Power

   The total power radiated by an undulator or wiggler is

   [[Sec2134.gif] ]                                        (18)


   where Z[0] = 377 ohms, or, in practical units,


   [[Sec2135.gif] ]


   The angular distribution of the radiated power is

   [[Sec2136.gif] ]                      (19)


   or, in units of W·mr^–2,

   [Sec2137.gif]


   The behavior of the angular function f[K](gq,gy), which is normalized
   as f[K](0,0) = 1, is shown in Fig. 2-7. The function G(K), shown in
   Fig. 2-8, quickly approaches unity as K increases from zero.

C.    EMITTANCE EFFECTS

   Electrons in storage rings are distributed in a finite area of
   transverse phase space—position ´ angle. We introduce the rms beam
   sizes s[x] (horizontal) and s[y] (vertical), and beam divergences
   [[Sec2138.gif] ](horizontal) and [[Sec2139.gif] ] (vertical). The
   quantities [[Sec2140.gif] ]and [[Sec2141.gif] ] are known as the
   horizontal and vertical emittances, respectively. In general, owing to
   the finite emittances of real electron beams, the intensity of the
   radiation observed in the forward direction is less than that given by
   Eqs. (2a) and (13a). Finite emittances can be taken into account
   approximately by replacing these equations by

   [[Sec2142.gif] ]                           (20)


   and

   [[Sec2143.gif] ]                       (21)



   for bends and undulators, respectively. For bending magnets, the
   electron beam divergence effect is usually negligible in the horizontal
   plane.

D.    SPECTRAL BRIGHTNESS AND
TRANSVERSE COHERENCE

   For experiments that require a small angular divergence and a small
   irradiated area, the relevant figure of merit is the beam brightness B,
   which is the photon flux per unit phase space volume, often given in
   units of photons·s^–1·mr^–2·mm^–2·(0.1% bandwidth)^–1. For an
   undulator, an approximate formula for the peak brightness is

   [[Sec2146.gif] ]                         (22)


   where, for example,

   [[Sec2147.gif] ]
   (23)



   and where the single-electron radiation from an axially extended source
   of finite wavelength is described by

   [[Sec2148.gif] ]
   (24



   Brightness is shown in Fig. 2-9 for several sources of synchrotron
   radiation, as well as some conventional x-ray sources.

   That portion of the flux that is transversely coherent is given by

   [[Sec2149.gif] ]               (25)


   A substantial fraction of undulator flux is thus transversely coherent
   for a low-emittance beam satisfying e[x]e[y] [[Sec2150.gif] ] (l/4p)^2.

E.    LONGITUDINAL COHERENCE

   Longitudinal coherence is described in terms of a coherence length

   [[Sec2151.gif] ]

   For an undulator, the various harmonics have a natural spectral purity
   of Dl/l = 1/nN [see Eq. (12)]; thus, the coherence length is given by

   [[Sec2152.gif]
   ]                                                               (27)


   which corresponds to the relativistically contracted length of the
   undulator. Thus, undulator radiation from low-emittance electron beams
   [e[x]e[y] [[Sec2153.gif] ] (l/4p)^2] is transversely coherent and is
   longitudinally coherent within a distance described by Eq. (27). In the
   case of finite beam emittance or finite angular acceptance, the
   longitudinal coherence is reduced because of the change in wavelength
   with emission angle. In this sense, undulator radiation is partially
   coherent. Transverse and longitudinal coherence can be enhanced when
   necessary by the use of spatial and spectral filtering (i.e., by use of
   apertures and monochromators, respectively).

   sources and conventional x-ray sources. The data for conventional x-ray
   tubes should be taken as rough estimates only, since brightness depends
   strongly on such parameters as operating voltage and take-off angle.
   The indicated two-order-of-magnitude ranges show the approximate
   variation that can be expected among stationary-anode tubes (lower end
   of range), rotating-anode tubes (middle), and rotating-anode tubes with
   microfocusing (upper end of range).
