        following ISS Projects:
          * Expediting the Process of Experiments to Space Station (EXPRESS)
            Rack Development
          * EXPRESS Rack Engineering Integration
          * International Subrack Interface Standards (ISIS) Drawers
          * Integrated Logistics and Maintenance for EXPRESS racks and EXPRESS
            rack derivatives
          * Window Observational Research Facility (WORF) Rack Development and
            Engineering Integration
          * Biological Research Project (BRP) Rack Development and Engineering
            Integration
          * Human Research Facility (HRF) Rack Development
          * EXPRESS Pallet Development Oversight
