PDS Browse

   ...is an interface to the PDS Distributed Inventory System (DIS) that
   provides the capability to search for any data set or related resource
   in the PDS. PDS Browse returns descriptive information about the
   resulting items and, if available, provides a link to the resource,
   data set, or related volume.

   Glossary:

   Data Set
          PDS data sets are the accumulation of science data products,
          secondary data, software, and documentation that completely
          document and support the use of those data products.

   Format
          The format selection specifies how the query results will
          appear. Object format will list each result in a keyword/value
          label format, the standard PDS mode for object descriptions.
          Table format will list the results in the browser table format.
          A selection of table format will default to object format if
          both data set and resource objects are in the query results.

   Object
          PDS objects are entities associated with Solar System
          exploration missions that include Target, Instrument, Instrument
          Host (e.g. Spacecraft), Mission, and Data Set. The PDS uses
          labels consisting of keyword/value statements to describe these
          entities. The PDSBrowse interface allows query for Data Set and
          Resource objects.

   Planetary Data System
          The Planetary Data System (PDS) archives and distributes digital
          data from past and present NASA planetary missions, astronomical
          observations, and laboratory measurements. The PDS is sponsored
          by NASA's Office of Space Science to ensure the long-term
          usability of data, to stimulate research, to facilitate data
          access, and to support correlative analysis.

   Resource
          PDS resources include user search aids such as catalogs and
          specialized on-line navigators; web sites such as PDS Node
          Homepages, on-line repositories, and standards documentation;
          software; and other helps such as science expertise.
