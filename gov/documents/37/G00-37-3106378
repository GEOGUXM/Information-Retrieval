   Alamos, NM 87545 October 29, 1998 Quantum mechanics provides
   spectacular new information processing abilities 1;2. One of the most
   unexpected is a procedure called quantum teleportation 3 that allows
   the quantum state of a system to be transported from one location to
   another, without moving through the intervening space. Partial
   implementations of teleportation 4;5 over macroscopic distances have
   been achieved using optical systems, but omit the final stage of the
   teleportation procedure. Here we report an experimental implementation
   of the full quantum teleportation operation over inter-atomic distances
   using liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The inclusion of
   the final stage enables for the first time a teleportation
   implementation which may be used as a subroutine in larger quantum
   computations, or for quantum communication. Our experiment also
   demonstrates the use of quantum process tomography, a procedure to
   completely characterize the dynamics of a quantum system. Finally, we
   demonstrate a controlled exploitation of decoherence as a tool to
   assist in the performance of an experiment. In classical physics, an
   object can be teleported, in principle, by performing a measurement to
   completely characterize the properties of the object. That information
   can then be sent to another location, and the object reconstructed.
   Does this provide a complete reconstruction of the original object? No:
   all physical systems are ultimately quantum mechanical, and quantum
   mechanics tells 1 us that it is impossible to completely determine the
   state of an unknown quantum system, making it impossible to use the
   classical measurement procedure to move a quantum system from one
   location to another. Bennett et al 3 have suggested a remarkable
   procedure for teleporting quantum states. Quantum teleportation may be
   described abstractly in terms of two parties, Alice and Bob. Alice has
   in her possession an unknown state j\Psi i = ffj0i + fij1i of a single
   quantum bit (qubit) - a two level quantum system. The goal of
   teleportation is to transport the state of that qubit to Bob. In
   addition, Alice and Bob each possess one qubit of a two qubit entangled
   state, j\Psi iA (j0iAj0iB + j1iAj1iB) ; (1) where subscripts A are used
   to denote Alice's systems, and subscripts B to denote Bob's system.
   Here and throughout we omit overall normalization factors from our
   equations. This state can be rewritten in the Bell basis ((j00i \Sigma
   j11i) ; (j01i \Sigma j10i) for the first two qubits and a conditional
   unitary transformation of the state j\Psi i for the last one, that is,
   (j00i + j11i) j\Psi i + (j00i \Gamma j11i) oezj\Psi i + (j01i + j10i)
   oexj\Psi i + (j01i \Gamma j10i) (\Gamma ioeyj\Psi i) ; (2) where oex;
   oey; oez are the Pauli sigma operators 6, in the j0i; j1i basis. A
   measurement is performed on Alice's qubits in the Bell basis.
   Conditional on these measurement outcomes it is easy to verify from the
   previous equation that Bob's respective states are j\Psi i; oezj\Psi i;
   oexj\Psi i; \Gamma ioeyj\Psi i: (3) Alice sends the outcome of her
   measurement to Bob, who can then recover the original state j\Psi i by
   applying the appropriate unitary transformation I; oex; oez, or ioey,
   conditional on Alice's measurement outcome. Notice that the quantum
   state transmission has not been accomplished faster than light because
   Bob must wait for Alice's measurement result to arrive before he can
   recover the quantum state. Recent demonstrations of quantum
   teleportation 4;5 omitted the final stage of teleportation, the unitary
   operators applied by Bob conditional on the result of Alice's
   measurement. This prevents complete recovery of the original state.
   Instead, the earlier experiments relied on classical post-processing of
   the data after completion of the experiment to check that the results
   were consistent with what one would expect if the conditional
   operations had, in fact, been performed. Our experiment implements the
   full teleportation operation. The most important implication of the
   inclusion of this difficult extra stage is that our teleportation
   procedure can, in principle, be used as a subroutine in the performance
   of other quantum information processing tasks. Teleportation as a
   subroutine is important in potential applications to quantum
   computation and communication 7;8, although in the present system,
   moving the C2 qubit to H may be accomplished more efficiently by
   techniques other than teleportation. 2 Our implementation of
   teleportation is performed using liquid state nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR), applied to an ensemble of molecules of labeled
   trichloroethylene (TCE). The structure of the TCE molecule may be
   depicted as Cl C2QQ Cl jj Cl QQ CljjH (4) To perform teleportation we
   make use of the Hydrogen nucleus (H), and the two Carbon 13 nuclei (C1
   and C2), teleporting the state of C2 to H. Figure 1(a) illustrates the
   teleportation process we used. The circuit has three inputs, which we
   will refer to as the data (C2), ancilla (C1), and target (H) qubits.
   The goal of the circuit is to teleport the state of the data qubit so
   that it ends up on the target qubit. We are therefore only teleporting
   the qubit a few angstroms, making this a demonstration of the method of
   teleportation, rather than a practical means for transmitting qubits
   over long distances. State preparation is done in our experiment using
   the gradient-pulse techniques described by Cory et al 9, and phase
   cycling 10;11. The unitary operations performed during teleportation
   may be implemented in a straightforward manner in NMR, using
   non-selective rf pulses tuned to the Larmor frequencies of the nuclear
   spins, and delays allowing entanglement to form through the interaction
   of neighboring nuclei 9;12. Other demonstrations of quantum information
   processing with three qubits using NMR are described in 14;15;16, and
   with two qubits in 17;18;19;20. An innovation in our experiment was the
   method used to implement the Bell basis measurement. In NMR, the
   measurement step allows us to measure the expectation values of oex and
   oey for each spin, averaged over the ensemble of molecules, rather than
   performing a projective measurement in some basis. For this reason, we
   must modify the projective measurement step in the standard description
   of teleportation, while preserving the remarkable teleportation effect.
   We use a procedure inspired by Brassard et al 21, who suggest a
   two-part procedure for performing the Bell basis measurement. Part one
   of the procedure is to rotate from the Bell basis into the
   computational basis, j00i; j01i; j10i; j11i. We implement this step in
   NMR by using the natural spin-spin coupling between the Carbon nuclei,
   and rf pulses. Part two of the procedure is to perform a projective
   measurement in the computational basis. As Brassard et al point out,
   the effect of this two part procedure is equivalent to performing the
   Bell basis measurement, and leaving the data and ancilla qubits in one
   of the four states, j00i; j01i; j10i; j11i, corresponding to the
   different measurement results. We cannot directly implement the second
   step in NMR. Instead, we exploit the natural phase decoherence
   occurring on the Carbon nuclei to achieve the same effect. Recall that
   phase decoherence completely randomizes the phase information in these
   nuclei and thus will destroy coherence between the elements of the
   above basis. Its effect on the state of the Carbon nuclei is to
   diagonalize the state in the computational basis, ae \Gamma !
   j00ih00jaej00ih00j + j01ih01jaej01ih01j + j10ih10jaej10ih10j 3
   +j11ih11jaej11ih11j: (5) As emphasized by Zurek 22, the decoherence
   process is indistinguishable from a measurement in the computational
   basis for the Carbons accomplished by the environment. We do not
   observe the result of this measurement explicitly, however the state of
   the nuclei selected by the decoherence process contains the measurement
   result, and therefore we can do the final transformation conditional on
   the particular state the environment has selected. As in the scheme of
   Brassard et al, the final state of the Carbon nuclei is one of the four
   states, j00i; j01i; j10i; j11i, corresponding to the four possible
   results of the measurement. Our experiment exploits the natural
   decoherence properties of the TCE molecule. The phase decoherence times
   (T2) for C1 and C2 are approximately 0:4s and 0:3s. All other T2 and T1
   times for all three nuclei are much longer, with a T2 time for the
   Hydrogen of approximately 3s, and relaxation times (T1) of
   approximately 20 \Gamma 30s for the Carbons, and 5s for the Hydrogen.
   Thus, for delays on the order of 1s, we can approximate the total
   evolution by exact phase decoherence on the Carbon nuclei. The total
   scheme therefore implements a measurement in the Bell basis, with the
   result of the measurement stored as classical data on the Carbon nuclei
   following the measurement. We can thus teleport the state from the
   Carbon to the Hydrogen and verify that the state in the final state
   decays at the Hydrogen rate and not the Carbon rate. Re-examining
   figure 1(a) we see how remarkable teleportation is from this point of
   view. During the stage labeled "Measure in the Bell basis" in figure
   1(a), we allow the C1 and C2 nuclei to decohere and thus be measured by
   the environment, destroying all phase information on the data and
   ancilla qubits. Experimentally, a standard NMR technique known as
   refocusing employs rf pulses to ensure that the data qubit effectively
   does not interact with the target qubit. Classical intuition therefore
   tells us that the phase information about the input state, j\Psi i, has
   been lost forever. Nevertheless, quantum mechanics predicts that we are
   still able to recover the complete system after this decoherence step,
   by quantum teleportation. We implemented this scheme in TCE using a
   Bruker DRX-500 NMR spectrometer. Experimentally, we determined the
   Larmor and coupling frequencies for the Hydrogen, C1 and C2 to be: !H
   ss 500:133491MHz; !C1 ss 125:772580MHz; !C2 ss !C1 \Gamma 911Hz (6) JH
   C1 ss 201Hz; JC1 C2 ss 103Hz: (7) The coupling frequencies between H
   and C2, as well as the Chlorines to H, C1 and C2, are much lower, on
   the order of ten Hertz for the former, and less than a Hertz for the
   latter. Experimentally, these couplings are suppressed by multiple
   refocusings, and will be ignored in the sequel. Note that C1 and C2
   have slightly different frequencies, due to the different chemical
   environments of the two atoms. 4 We performed two separate sets of
   experiments. In one set, the full teleportation process was executed,
   making use of a variety of decoherence delays in place of the
   measurement. The readout was performed on the Hydrogen nucleus, and a
   figure of merit - the entanglement fidelity - was calculated for the
   teleportation process. The entanglement fidelity is a quantity in the
   range 0 to 1 which measures the combined strength of all noise
   processes occurring during the process 23;24. In particular, an
   entanglement fidelity of 1 indicates perfect teleportation, while an
   entanglement fidelity of 0:25 indicates total randomization of the
   state. Perfect classical transmission corresponds to an entanglement
   fidelity of 0:5 23;24, so entanglement fidelities greater than 0:5
   indicates that teleportation of some quantum information is taking
   place. The second set of experiments was a control set, illustrated in
   figure 1(b). In those experiments, only the state preparation and
   initial entanglement of H and C1 were performed, followed by a delay
   for decoherence on C1 and C2. The readout was performed in this
   instance on C2, and the entanglement fidelity was calculated for the
   process. The results of our experiment are shown in figure 2, where the
   entanglement fidelity is plotted against the decoherence delay. Errors
   in our experiment arise from the strong coupling effect, imperfect
   calibration of rf pulses, and rf field inhomogeneities. The estimated
   uncertainties in the entanglement fidelities are less than \Sigma 0:05,
   and are due primarily to rf field inhomogeneity and imperfect
   calibration of rf pulses. To determine the entanglement fidelities for
   the teleportation and control experiments, we performed quantum process
   tomography 25;26, a procedure for obtaining a complete description of
   the dynamics of a quantum system, as follows: The linearity of quantum
   mechanics implies that the single qubit input and output for the
   teleportation process are related by a linear quantum operation 27. By
   preparing a complete set of four linearly independent initial states,
   and measuring the corresponding states output from the experiment, we
   may completely characterize the quantum process, enabling us to
   calculate the entanglement fidelity for the process 26. Three elements
   ought to be noted in figure 2. First, for small decoherence delays, the
   entanglement fidelity for the teleportation experiments significantly
   exceeds the value of 0:5 for perfect classical transmission of data,
   indicating successful teleportation of quantum information from C2 to
   H, with reasonable fidelity. Second, the entanglement fidelity decays
   very quickly for the control experiments as the delay is increased.
   Theoretically, we expect this to be the case, due to a T 2 time for C2
   of approximately 0:3s. Third, the decay of the entanglement fidelity
   for the teleportation experiments occurs much more slowly.
   Theoretically, we expect this decay to be due mainly to the effect of
   phase decoherence and relaxation on the Hydrogen. Our experimental
   observations are consistent with this prediction, and provide more
   support for the claim that quantum data is being teleported in these
   experiments. 5 References [1] Bennett, C. H. Quantum information and
