     A. Federal Criminal Code Related to Searching and Seizing Computers

     1. The USA PATRIOT Act

     IMPORTANT NOTE:

     The USA PATRIOT Act, effective October 26, 2001, resulted in a
     number of significant changes to various Federal statutes governing
     the searching and seizing of computers and the gathering of
     electronic evidence. The Field Guidance memorandum provides an
     overview of the various ways in which the USA PATRIOT Act has
     changed the law in this area.
     * Field Guidance on New Authorities that Relate to Computer Crime and
       Electronic Evidence Enacted in the USA Patriot Act of 2001

     In order to highlight changes in the law resulting from the USA
     PATRIOT Act, CCIPS has produced a redlined document showing various
     Federal statutes relevant to computer search and seizure and
     electronic evidence-gathering issues, and how these statutes have
     changed under the new law. Please note that this is a draft document
     designed to provide an overview of recent changes, and may contain
     typographical errors. It is not an official CCIPS publication.

     3. Searching and Seizing Computers and Obtaining Electronic Evidence
     in Criminal Investigations

     This publication provides a comprehensive guide to the legal issues
     that arise when federal law enforcement agents search and seize
     computers and obtain electronic evidence in criminal investigations.
     The topics covered include the application of the Fourth Amendment
     to computers and the Internet, the Electronic Communications Privacy
     Act, workplace privacy, the law of electronic surveillance, and
     evidentiary issues. This publication supersedes "Federal Guidelines
     for Searching and Seizing Computers" (1994), as well as the
     Guidelines' 1997 and 1999 Supplements.

     IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING THIS PUBLICATION: Since January 2001 when
     this publication was released, there have been significant changes
     to Federal law governing electronic evidence-gathering issues,
     resulting from the USA PATRIOT Act, as noted above. CCIPS intends to
     release an updated version of this manual, including the USA PATRIOT
     changes to Federal law, in the near future. In the meantime,
     however, readers of this publication seeking accurate statutory
     information should review the current language of applicable
     statutes, and consult other publications such as the Field Guidance
     noted above.

     B.  The Fourth Amendment and the Internet

     Kevin V. Di Gregory, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, testified

     C. Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), CALEA
     Implementation Section, USA Bulletin (May 2001)

     Electronic surveillance is one of the most valuable tools in law
     enforcement's crime fighting arsenal. In many instances, criminal
     activity has been either thwarted, or, if crimes have been
     committed, the criminals have been apprehended as a result of
     lawfully-authorized electronic surveillance.

     D.  Recognizing and Meeting Title III Concerns in Computer
     Investigations, Robert Strang, USA Bulletin (March 2001)

     The dramatic increase in crimes involving the Internet, and computer
     crimes more generally, is well documented. The "2000 CSI/FBI
     Computer Crime and Security Survey" documented that 90% of the 643
     respondents (primarily large U.S. corporations and government
     agencies) detected computer security breaches within the last twelve
     months, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. In light
     of the increased criminal opportunities created by the ever-growing
     reliance on, and growing interconnectedness between network
     computers, there can be no doubt that experienced and sophisticated
     computer criminals pose a substantial challenge to law enforcement.

     Kerr, USA Bulletin (March 2001)

     This article explains some of the important issues that can arise
