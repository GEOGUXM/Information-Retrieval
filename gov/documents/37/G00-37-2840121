   The goal of the Community Outreach Program (COP) is to establish
   relationships between the FBI and the community.

   As a part of the COP, the St. Louis office of the FBI has established a
   Junior Special Agent Program for fifth grade students at the Patrick
   Henry Elementary School, 1220 N. 10th St., St. Louis, Missouri.  This
   program is designed to reach young people and encourage them to remain
   drug free, gang free, and violence free.  Employees of the FBI offer
   instruction to students on a monthly basis on such topics as
   citizenship, physical fitness, self-esteem, cultural diversity, and
   crime prevention.  Employees emphasize the importance of positive
   outside activities which are alternatives to drugs and gangs.  Students
   are presented awards during the year for perfect attendance, improved
   attitude, etc.  Following the completion of instruction the students
   are awarded Junior Special Agent badges and take an oath to be good
   citizens, obey all laws and do their best in school.
