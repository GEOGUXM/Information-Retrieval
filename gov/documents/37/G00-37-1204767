     FrogWeb: Amphibian Deformities

   The Problem:

   Amphibian malformations have been reported in 44 states since 1996.
   These deformities include: extra legs; extra eyes; misshapen or
   incompletely formed limbs; limb formation in anatomically inappropriate
   places; missing limbs; and missing eyes.
   While anatomical deformities are a natural phenomenon within virtually
   all species, the widespread occurence of these deformities, and the
   relatively high frequency of malformations within local populations (as
   high as 60% in some areas), concern wildlife biologists. Most
   scientists agree that the rates of deformities far exceed what can be
   considered "natural," and are currently investigating several factors -
   including parasites, contaminants, and UV radiation - which may be
   causing them.
   The cause of deformities in one region may, or may not, be responsible
   for those in another area....or a combination of factors may be the
   cause of malformation occurences across the country. The research
   continues.
