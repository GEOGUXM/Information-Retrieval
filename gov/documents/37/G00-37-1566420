   A registered identification number or RN is a number issued by the
   Federal Trade Commission, upon request, to a business residing in the
   U.S. that is engaged in the manufacture, importing, distribution, or
   sale of textile, wool, or fur products. Such businesses are not
   required to have RNs. They may, however, use the RN in place of a name
   on the label or tag that is required to be affixed to these products.

   Please note: Some of the information in this directory may be out of
   date. It reflects the information provided to the Commission on the
   original RN application or the most recent update. However, businesses
   may have moved, changed their name, or gone out of business without
   informing the Commission. The Commission hopes that placing the
   directory on its web site will encourage RN holders to check the
   information and UPDATE it, if necessary. At some time in the future,
   the Commission may cancel numbers that appear to be no longer in use or
   do not reflect accurate identifying information.
