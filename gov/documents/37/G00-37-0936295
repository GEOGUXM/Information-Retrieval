   The Fish and Game Regulations booklets are released throughout the year
   as they are set and approved by the Office of Administrative Law. The
   Office of Administrative Law has a searchable website for all
   regulations. If you wish to use their site, keep in mind that all fish
   and game regulations are found in the Title 14 of the California Code
   of Regulations. The hunting license year is from July 1 to June 30.
   The fishing license year is from January 1 to December 31, but the new
   fishing regulations for inland waters become effective on March 1 of
   each year.
   The regulations booklets come out as follows:

   Jan 15 -- Inland Waters and Marine Waters Fishing Regs
   May 14 -- Fishing Regs Ocean Supplement
   May 14 -- Mammal Regs
   June 18 -- Inland Salmon Fishing Regs Supplement
   August 13 -- Early Bird Flyer
   September 11 -- Resident and Upland Game Regs
   September 11 -- State and Federal Areas
   October 1 -- Waterfowl Regs.

   The Fish and Game Code contains the complete text of the legislated
   laws concerning fish and game. The regulations booklets are generally
   posted in the .pdf format so that they are a complete and exact copy of
   the printed regulations. Individual regulation sections are available
   at the OAL link above.
