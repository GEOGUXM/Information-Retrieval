  The Northwest River Forecast Center

    is one of 13 National Weather Service hydrologic centers in the United
    States. This office specializes in flood and water resource forecasting,
    river modeling, and hydrologic system development. It works with water
    management agencies to provide the best possible operations of the Columbia
    reservoir systems. The center is very active in recreational and
    navigational hydrological forecasting.

    Mission:

   To save lives and decrease property damage by the issuance of flood
   warnings and river stage forecasts. Provide basic hydrologic forecast
   information for the Nation's economic and environmental well being.
   Provide extended forecast information for water resources management.

    Service Area:

   The area of responsibility encompasses over 285,786 square miles and
   includes parts of 7 states and parts of western Canada. It is the
   second most hydrologic active River Forecast Center in the United
   States.

    Flood Forecasting

   Floods are a natural and inevitable occurrence along the rivers of our
   country. In the northwest, winter flooding is dominated by heavy
   precipitation events, while spring flood events result from snowmelt,
   augmented by precipitation.

   The Northwest River Forecast Center uses the National Weather Service
   River Forecast System (NWSRFS) and the Streamflow Simulation and
   Reservoir Regulation (SSARR) to simulate soil, snow, stream channel and
   reservoir conditions. Daily forecasts are made using observations of
   temperature and precipitation. Forecast of meteorological parameters
   are included in the river forecast model.

   Flood forecasts and warnings are disseminated to the public through
   Weather Forecast Offices. Forecast distribution is made using the NOAA
   Weather Radio, commercial radio, television, and local emergency
   agencies.

   Flood Facts:
     * More people die in flood related events than from any other natural
       disasters.
     * Most flood related deaths occur in motor vehicles.

    Water Resource Forecasts

   The demands for fresh water are increasing and more effective
   management of our limited water resource has become critical.
   Operations of reservoir systems are growing more complex, involving
   trade-offs between water supply, flood control, power generation,
   fisheries, recreation, and environmental concerns. Advanced
   hydrometeorologic and climatic forecasting techniques are available to
   reduce the risk as well as to increase the efficiency of water
   management decisions.

   The NWRFC provides water managers water resource information throughout
   the year. Forecasts of seasonal water supply are prepared monthly from
   January through June. These forecasts are a useful indicator of either
   potential flood or drought conditions. They are used by water managers
   for complex water management decisions.

   Water supply forecasts are made available to the public in the
   publication "Water Supply Outlook for the Western United States." They
   are also available in a local publications produced by the NWRFC and
   other western RFCs.

    Extended Streamflow Prediction (ESP)

   The Extended Streamflow Prediction system enables a hydrologist to make
   extended probabilistic forecasts of streamflow and other hydrologic
   variables.

   ESP uses historical meteorological data to represent possible future
   conditions. A separate streamflow time series is simulated for each
   year of historical data using the current simulated conditions as the
   starting point for each streamflow forecast. The streamflow times
   series can be analyzed for peak flows, minimum flows, flow volumes,
   etc., for any period in the future. A statistical analysis is performed
   using the values obtained from each year's simulation to produce an
   uncertainty forecast for the streamflow variable.

   Meteorological and climatological forecast are included to further
   condition the statistical distribution.

    Hydrometeorological Analysis and Support (HAS)

   The HAS functions are designed to capitalize on high resolution data
   sources and computational power provided by new technologies of the
   modernized Weather Service. It will bring cohesiveness to the total
   hydrologic cycle and bridge the gap which has existed between hydrology
   and meteorology. A staff of three hydrometeorologists at each River
   Forecast follows:

     * Assimilation of gridded hydrometeorological data sets for the RFC
       area of responsibility.
     * Assimilation of quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs),
       temperature forecasts, precipitation and temperature outlooks, and
       forecasts of other hydrometeorological variables for the RFC area
       of responsibility.
     * Produce daily flood potential discussions and daily
       hydrometeorological situation discussions.
     * Perform hydrometeorological forecast verifications.
     * Provide for improved communication of hydrometeorological
       information and support between River Forecast Centers and Weather
       Forecast Offices.
     * Develop and enhance hydrometeorological techniques.

    River Forecast Centers

   The National Weather Service has 13 regional River Forecast Centers
   (RFC). Each center is within at least one major river system. These
   centers prepare river and flood forecasts, warnings, and water resource
   information. Forecast information is distributed to the public through
   the Service Hydrology Program of the Weather Forecast Offices.

   During periods of flooding, the RFCs issue forecasts for the height of
   the flood crest, the time a river is expected to overflow its banks
   (flood stage), and the time when the river is expected to recede to
   within its banks. The RFCs coordinate directly with water management
   agencies to optimize reservoir flood control space during major flood
   events.

   During nonflood periods, the RFCs make daily streamflow forecasts for
   water management and prepare seasonal water supply forecasts. The
   centers provide guidance for a national flash flood program and assist
   cities in developing local flash flood warning systems. Navigational
   and recreational forecasts are also produced by some centers.
