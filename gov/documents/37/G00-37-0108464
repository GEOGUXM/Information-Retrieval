   Hua Hu received a B.S. degree in Earth and Space Sciences from the
   University of Science and Technology of China and a Ph.D. degree in
   Geophysics from the University of Washington. In 1994, she joined JPL
   as a postdoctoral research associate, and later joined the Air-sea
   Interaction and Climate group at the Ocean Sciences Element. During her
   graduate studies, she studied thunderstorm, lightning, fair-weather
   electricity, and cosmic rays in the near-earth electrical environment.
   Her Ph.D. dissertation involved several balloon and rocket experiements
   in which she gained extensive hands-on experiences of hardware and
   software developments ( A photo of a balloon launch in NASA Wallops
   Island Facility). During her postdoctoral research, she studied
   atmospheric trace gases, e.g., CO, CH4, N2O, and had participated in 45
   NASA ER-2 aircraft flights during a NASA ozone experiement. Hua's
   current research interests are tropical storm, global hydrologic cycle,
   greenhouse effect, and air-sea interaction. Her research investigation
   utilizes various satelliate measurements, such as NSCAT, QuikSCAT,
   TRMM, EOS-TERRA, SeaWiFS, TOPEX, ERS, AVHRR, SSMI, ISCCP, ERBE, and
   UARS. Hua received an Excellent B.S. Thesis Award and a NASA Group
   Achievement Award.
