   Electron and Optical Physics Division


   About the Electron and Optical Physics Division
   The Division, part of NIST's Physics Laboratory, develops measurement
   capabilities needed by emerging electronic and optical technologies,
   particularly those required for submicrometer fabrication and analysis.
   In pursuit of this mission, it maintains an array of research,
   measurement, and calibration activities.

                               Research Areas
   The Electron and Optical Physics Division is divided into three groups:

   - Photon Physics Group: performs research in the areas of far
               ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) physics.

   - Far Ultraviolet Physics Group: is responsible for SURF III operations
     and for source-based radiometry and calibration services in the far UV
                        and soft x-ray spectral regions.

   -   Electron Physics Group: has the mission of advancing measurement
     science for the determination of electronic and magnetic properties of
                            nanometer-scale systems.
