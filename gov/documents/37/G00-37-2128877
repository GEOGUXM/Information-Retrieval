      2002 Community Tree Planting grant

      Do you care about trees? Like getting your hands dirty? Want to meet
      new people in your community? Just apply for a grant through National
      Tree Trust, a non-profit tree planting organization. NTT has grants
      available for receiving tree seedlings in Spring 2002 through the
      Community Tree Planting Grant Program. This is a great way to beautify
      your community, replant a neglected area, or simply a good excuse to
      get out in the fresh air. Seedlings are available for delivery January
      through April 2002, and the main requirements for the grant are as
      follows:
        * Trees must be planted on public land
        * Project must utilize volunteers for planting and/or maintaining
          seedlings
        * Two years of annual reporting are required for each grant

      Please visit our website at www.nationaltreetrust.org  if you would
      like to receive more information about the Community Tree Planting
      Program or to download an application. Seedlings are allocated on a
      first come, first served basis.  Thank you and Happy Planting!

      If you are interested in growing your own trees, check out our Growing
      Together program on the NTT website. This grant provides educators with
      the materials and funds to plant trees inside the classroom.
