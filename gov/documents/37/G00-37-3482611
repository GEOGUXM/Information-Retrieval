                   China Critical Infrastructure Analysis
                   The Silicon Computer

                   China Critical Infrastructure Analysis:
              Water, Agriculture, Energy, and Greenhouse Gases

   Sandia National Laboratories has been engaged in a high-level analysis
   of the critical infrastructures of the Peoples Republic of China to
   address questions about China's ability to meet its long-term grain
   requirements and energy needs and to estimate greenhouse gas emissions
   in China likely to result from increased economic activity and energy
   use. The integrated China infrastructure model presented here is a
   comprehensive state-of-the-art model that successfully combines four
   dynamic infrastructure models-water, agriculture, energy, and
   greenhouse gas to simulate, respectively, hydrologic budgetary
   processes, grain production and consumption, energy demand, and
   greenhouse gas emissions in China through the year 2025. The integrated
   model simulates diverse flow networks of commodities, such as water and
   greenhouse gas, between the separate models to capture the overall
   dynamics of the integrated system and more accurately generate
   projections of the outcomes of changes in the commodity flows.

The Model in Action

   The model was developed using the POWERSIM Constructor 2.5 modeling
   system. This platform generates results quickly (within minutes rather
   than hours or weeks), presents the results visually, demonstrates the
   relationships between the key variables, and allows the user to make
   adjustments for various what if scenarios and policy options
   concerning available water use, water-constrained grain production,
   caloric consumption, population growth, grain yield, sectoral gross
   domestic product (GDP) growth, sectoral energy intensities, fuel
   shares, energy requirements, and greenhouse gas emissions.

   As shown in Figure 1, the integrated model couples commodity flows for
   water, methane (CH[4]) and carbon dioxide (CO[2]) (solid arrows)
   between the separate infrastructure models. Additional commodity flows
   that have been proposed for future modeling are also presented in the
   figure (dotted arrows). The figure also identifies the six greenhouse
   gasses addressed in the Kyoto ProtocolCH[4], CO[2], nitrous oxide
   (N[2]O), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and
   sulphur hexafluoride (SF[6]). Only two of these, CH[4] and CO[2] have
   been modeled in the critical infrastructure model to date.

Approach to Infrastructure Analysis

   The model was used to generate projections of Chinas available water
   resources, expected water use, and grain consumption and production for
   10 river drainage regions representing 100% of Chinas mean annual
   runoff and comprising 37 major river basins. The locations of the 10
   regions are shown in Figure 2. Growth in energy use in six historically
   significant sectors and in greenhouse gas loading were projected for
   all of China. Greenhouse gases analyzed in the modeling effort were
   CO[2] and CH[4] emissions from the energy sector and CH[4] emissions
   from the agricultural sector. The study period extended from 1980 to
   2025.

              Figure 2. The 10 river drainage regions of China.

   The analysis specifically included projecting the total available water
   in each river drainage region through the year 2025 and comparing these
   results with projections of total water use in each region in the three
   end-use sectors-urban, industrial, and agricultural-to determine the
   expected frequency of each region experiencing a water deficit through
   the study period. The model estimates violations of the sustainable
   yield constraint, as follows: The constraint is violated when
   groundwater withdrawals exceed an amount equal to the average recharge
   plus agricultural return flows; if the available water does not meet
   the water use requirements, a deficit results. The model also assumes a
   water use priority scheme in which the impact of a deficit is felt
   first by the agricultural sector, second by the industrial sector, and
   lastly by the urban sector. Projections of the all-China demand for the
   three major grains (corn, wheat, and rice), meat, and other (other
   grains and fruits and vegetables) were also generated through 2025.
   Each regions share of the all-China grain demand (allocated on the
   basis of each regions share of historic grain production) and
   projections of the land required in each region to meet this allocated
   demand were also generated. Agricultural land requirements were
   compared with an initial approximation of arable land estimated using a
   geographic information system (GIS) analysis that identified all land
   with a slope greater than or equal to 1%.

   Growth in energy use for coal, oil, natural gas, hydroelectric power,
   and nuclear power were projected in each of six historically
   significant sectorsagriculture, industry, construction,
   transportation, commerce, and residential (and other)on the basis of
   GDP and decreasing sectoral energy intensities. Energy demand and fuel
   consumption were projected for China through 2025 for the case where
   nuclear and hydropower capture increasing shares (corresponding with
   official plans of the Chinese government) and for an alternative
   scenario with accelerated use of nuclear and hydropower. CO[2] and
   CH[4]emissions resulting from the production (extraction), distribution
   (primarily natural gas pipelines), and consumption (burning) of coal,
   oil and natural gas were projected through 2025 and compared with U.S.
   and world-wide emissions for 1995. Projections of CO[2] emissions for
   the scenario of accelerated use of nuclear and hydropower were also
   generated. Agricultural emissions of CH[4] directly from animals and
   their waste products and from flooded rice paddies were also projected.

   The analysis constituted Phase II of Sandias China infrastructure
   analysis. Phase I, completed in 1997, consisted of an analysis of the
   dynamics of water availability and use in China, with particular
   emphasis on the agricultural end-use sector. The analysis was part of
   an effort undertaken by the Medea group of scientists at the request of
   the National Intelligence Council (NIC) to improve the understanding of
   future grain production and consumption in the China and to make a
   preliminary assessment of the impact of potential grain shortfalls in
   China on the world grain market.
