   About the National Research Program

   Background
   The NRP had its beginnings in the late 1950's. Since that time, the
   program has grown to encompass a broad spectrum of scientific
   investigations. The sciences of hydrology, mathematics, chemistry,
   physics, ecology, biology, geology, and engineering are used to gain a
   fundamental understanding of the processes that affect the
   availability, movement, and quality of the Nation's water resources.
   Results of NRP's long-term research investigations often lead to the
   development of new concepts, techniques, and approaches that are
   applicable not only to the solution of current water problems, but also
   to future issues that may affect the Nation's water resources. Basic
   tools of hydrology that have been developed by the NRP include ground
   water modeling, geochemical modeling, and regional flood frequency
   analysis. These and other tools developed by the NRP are in common use
   today throughout the USGS, in other agencies, and in the private
   sector. Additional information about the NRP is provided by U.S.
   Geological Survey Circular 1195, which is available in pdf format. It
   provides some indication of the scope of research problems that were
   being addressed in 1999, when it was published.
   Organization
   The NRP is located principally in Reston, Va., Denver, Colo., and Menlo
   Park, Calif. A Chief, Branch of Regional Research, (BRR) at each
   location is responsible for managing the program. The Chief, BRR,
   reports directly to the Chief, Office of Hydrologic Research, who
   oversees the entire program. For technical administration, the NRP is
   subdivided into six research disciplines with a Research Adviser and
   Assistant Research Adviser assigned to each. The Research Advisers
   serve as a peer resource to the research projects and as a technical
   consultant to management.

   Indexes to projects and bibliographies:
   Encompassing a broad spectrum of scientific investigations, the NRP
   projects integrate hydrological, geological, chemical, climatological,
   and biological information related to water resources and environmental
   hazards. For convenience, several indexes are provided to individual
   project descriptions and bibliographies.
