   Technology and Applications Program Background

   The "bridge" by which other agencies, the private sector, and NASA
   work  with  JPL  is the Technology  and  Applications  Program  (TAP)
   Directorate.  TAP  is  responsible for planning and directing
   technology development, technology transfer, and technology
   applications programs that serve the programmatic, institutional, and
   advanced technology objectives of NASA, reimbursable sponsors, and JPL.

   The resources and facilities available to TAP, and by extension, to TAP
   customers and sponsors, include the entire staff and all the sites of
   the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Two thirds of the lab's employees are
   dedicated to technical and research activities, most with advanced
   credentials. In 1999, JPL has a workforce of about 4,900 employees and
   710 on-site contractors, and an annual budget of approximately $1.15
   billion.

   JPL is a world leader in providing advanced space technology, enabling
   "impossible" missions.

   TAP's central purpose is to create advances in space technology that
   will afford unforeseen advances in space and Earth sciences. TAP's
   long-term vision is a world united to explore and understand the
   farthest reaches of the universe.

   To promote this ambitious future, TAP seeks to be a world leader in
   breakthrough technology for robotic exploration of the solar system and
   beyond, and for infusing that technology into U. S. government agencies
   and industry.

   TAP's values, which shape the approach to accomplishing TAP's mission,
   are the JPL values: creativity, excellence, integrity, openness, and
   respect.

   Technology and Applications Program Mission Statement:

     "Lead in the identification, development, demonstration and
     qualification of advanced technologies that enable JPL to 'do what
     no one has done before' in NASA robotic space missions and in
     fulfilling other sponsors missions. Apply JPL's special competencies
     to nationally significant technical and scientific problems,
     including commercialization of JPL technology."
