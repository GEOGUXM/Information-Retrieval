USGS Mapping Partnership Program
     __________________________________________________________________

   The USGS is interested in forming cooperative partnerships with
   organizations from all levels of government and industry for geospatial
   data production and mapping science research. Through a variety of
   partnership mechanisms, the USGS seeks to ensure geospatial data
   availability and currentness, eliminate duplication in geospatial data
   production through increased coordination with producers and users, and
   transfer technologies to the private sector.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Program Benefits

     * Cost Savings: Pooled resources result in lower geospatial data
       production costs for each partner.

     * Data Standardization: The use of geospatial data standards and
       compliance with Federal data transfer standards enhance data
       compatibility and allow the transfer of files between formats.

     * Data Availability: Partnerships extend resources which increase
       production and expand product inventories.

     * Technology Transfer: Partnerships facilitate information and
       technology exchange between public and private mapping
       organizations.

  Program Mechanics

   Flexible financial and human resource commitments from each partner are
   critical to the success of the partnership program. The USGS is willing
   to work with potential cooperators to reach mutually beneficial
   agreements.
     * Conventional Partnerships
     * Innovative Partnerships
     * Framework Partnerships
     * Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA)
