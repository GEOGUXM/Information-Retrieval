California's Energy Emergency Contingency Plan

     One of the California Energy Commission's legislative mandates is
     preparing for and dealing with energy emergencies. The Commission,
     under the Chairman and at the direction of the Governor, is the
     primary state agency to direct the state's response to natural and
     man-made energy emergencies. In the past two decades, the Commission
     has responded to energy shortages as the result of fire, earthquake,
     civil unrest and supply disturbances. The Commission also prepares
     an emergency plan every five years and tests that plan using
     simulations and models. Additionally, the Commission assists local
     government in developing local energy emergency plans.

     Emergencies stemming from possible shortages of electricity,
     however, are not handled by the Energy Commission's Contingency
     Planning Office. Under Executive Order by Governor Davis (D-15-00)
     the State and Consumer Services Agency is responsible for direct
     action during short-term electricity shortages, such as those
     declared by the California Independent System Operator (ISO).

     From this page, you will be able to access the latest situation
     reports if the state experiences an energy emergency. For
     information about electric utility power outages, contact the local
     electricity service provider.
