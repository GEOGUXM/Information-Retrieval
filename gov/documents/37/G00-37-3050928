Headquarters

     BFRL is the national laboratory dedicated to enhancing the
     competitiveness of U.S. industry and public safety through
     performance prediction and measurement technologies and technical
     advances that improve the life cycle quality of constructed
     facilities. LINK to organizational chart

  Divisions

     * Structures   The Structures Division promotes construction
       productivity and structural safety by providing measurements and
       standards to support the design, construction and serviceability of
       constructed facilities.
     * Building Materials   The Building Materials Division performs
       research to advance construction materials science and technology.
     * Building Environment   The Building Environment Division reduces
       the cost of designing and operating buildings and increases the
       international competitiveness of the U.S. building industry by
       providing modeling, measurement, and test methods needed to use
       advanced computation and automation effectively in construction, to
       improve the performance of building equipment and systems.
     * Fire Research   The Fire Research Division develops, verifies, and
       utilizes measurements and predictive methods to quantify the
       behavior of fire and the means to reduce the impact of fire on
       people, property, and the environment.  The Division provides
       leadership for advancing the theory and practice of fire safety
       engineering, fire fighting, fire investigation, fire testing, fire
       data management, and intentional burning.

  Offices

     * Applied Economics  The Office of Applied Economics provides
       economic products and services through research and consulting to
       industry and government agencies in support of productivity
       enhancement, economic growth, and international competitiveness,
       with a focus on improving the life-cycle quality and economy of
       constructed facilities.
     * Construction and Building Subcommittee   The Committee on
       Technology's Subcommittee on Construction and Building (C&B) was
       organized in 1994 to coordinate and focus the work of 14 federal
       agencies in enhancing the competitiveness of U.S. industry, public
       and worker safety and environmental quality through research and
       development. The Subcommittee works in cooperation with U.S.
       industry, labor and academia for improvement of the life cycle
       performance, sustainability, efficiency, effectiveness and economy
       of constructed facilities.
