   NIST's Building Integrated Photovoltaic program is outlined in the
   associated roadmap.  The program consists of short-term testing to
   characterize the electrical performance of Building Integrated
   Photovoltaic panels that utilize various cell technologies, modelling
   to predict the annual energy prediction of the the characterized
   panels, and long-term performance monitoring of the BIPV panels under
   real-world conditions.  The measured performance will be compared to
   predicted performance.  Discrepancies will be reported to the authors
   of the computer simulation models.  Joint efforts will be undertaken to
   improve the accuracy of the predictive models.
