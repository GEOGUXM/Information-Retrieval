   NGST Science Goals

        Visiting a time when galaxies were young

        from Exploration and the Search for Origins:
        A Vision for Ultraviolet-Optical-Infrared Space Astronomy, HST and
        Beyond Committee

      Astronomy in the latter half of this century has made wondrous
      discoveries, expanded our understanding of the universe and opened
      humanity's vision beyond the visible portion of the electromagnetic
      spectrum. Our knowledge of how the cosmos was born and how many of its
      phenomena arise has grown exponentially in just one human lifetime. In
      spite of these great strides there remain fundamental questions that
      are largely unanswered. To further our understanding of the way our
      present universe formed following the Big Bang requires a new type of
      observatory with capabilities currently unavailable in either existing
      ground-based or space telescopes. Simply put, a goal of the Next
      Generation Space Telescope (NGST) is to observe the first stars and
      galaxies in the Universe. This grand effort is embedded in fundamental
      questions that have been posed to NASA's Space Science program:
       1. What is the shape of the Universe?
       2. How do galaxies evolve?
       3. How do stars and planetary systems form and interact?
       4. How did the Universe build up it present elemental/chemical
          composition?
       5. What is dark matter?

      Answers to most of these questions involve objects formed extremely
      early in the history of the universe (figure 1 below). Such objects
      have their radiation greatly redshifted when observed in the current
      epoch, meaning that observations are best performed in the infrared
      portion of the spectrum. The NGST will be capable of detecting
      radiation whose wavelength lies in the range 0.6 to 20 microns (and be
      optimized for the 1 to 5 micron region). Furthermore, the NGST must be
      able to see objects 400 times fainter than those currently studied with
      large ground-based infrared telescopes (such as the Keck Observatory,
      or Gemini Project) or the current generation of space-based infrared
      telescopes (ISO, NICMOS or SIRTF), and it must do so with the spatial
      resolution (image sharpness) comparable to the Hubble Space Telescope
      (HST).

   Where NGST fits in:

      Our current understanding of how the Universe was formed and evolved is
      remarkably well constrained at the extreme ends of time. That is, we
      have a fairly good understanding of what the Universe is like today and
      the recent past (when the universe was between 10-15 billion years old)
      from observations at all wavelengths. We also have a pretty good
      understanding of what the universe was like when it was quite young
      (less than about 1 million years old) based upon observations of the
      cosmic microwave background and high energy particle physics. This
      middle ground however, between 1 million and a few billion years old,
      is completely unobserved. It is during this time period that the first
      structures we see today, namely stars and galaxies, began to form (see
      figure 1).

        Figure 1: Schematic history of the Universe with the present
        ('today' on the left and the most distant past, 'big bang' on the
        right). The shaded red region shows the region of Universe history
        accessible the the NGST. The NGST will sample that part of the
        Universe's history during which the first stars and galaxies formed.
        In contrast we show the regions of history studied by other missions
        (COBE and HST). The age of the universe is shown on the top scale,
        going from zero at the right to 10 billion years at the left. The
        bottom scale is called redshift, labeled z. It is the fractional
        increase in the wavelength of light from the moment it was emitted
        to the moment we receive it, and the number (1+z) is the ratio of
        the size of the universe now to the size it was at an earlier time.

      To address some of the questions mentioned above astronomers have
      created a prototype observing mission for the NGST designed to answer
      just these questions. The program is divided roughly into five theme
      areas. Each link below leads to additional detail about the science and
      its requirements for the observatory.
       1. Cosmology and the Structure of the Universe
       2. The Origin and Evolution of Galaxies
       3. The History of the Milky Way and Its Neighbors
       4. The Birth and Formation of Stars
       5. The Origins and Evolution of Planetary Systems
