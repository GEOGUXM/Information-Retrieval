   Project Description
   The waters off southern Georgia and northern Florida are the calving
   grounds for the endangered Right Whale from November to April. The
   total population of these mammals is currently about 300, with about 11
   calves born into the population each year. Human impacts are a major
   factor in the whales' ability to increase their numbers. Since the
   early 1990s, net entanglements and ship strikes have led to the average
   death and injury of one to two Right Whales each year. These impacts
   are believed to be retarding the recovery and growth of the population.
   Due to this continuing threat, the NMFS designated this area as
   critical habitat in June 1994.

   These same waters are also used heavily by commercial, recreational,
   and military vessels traveling to and from highly valuable ports in
   this region. Jacksonville, the largest, services nearly 1,400 vessels,
   carrying five million tons of cargo each year worth nearly $1.8
   billion. The cost to run one of these cargo vessels under normal
   conditions is about $35,000 per day. When these vessels are impeded
   during transit, by either collisions or regulations that reduce their
   speed, it results in increased transportation costs, reduced fuel
   efficiency, and decreased international competitiveness.

   To mitigate the effect of these human activities, overflights of the
   waters off Georgia and northern Florida are conducted to locate the
   whales and relay this information to transiting vessel captains. In the
   1996-97 whale season, flights have increased in frequency and aerial
   coverage. Last year, six whales died during the calving season. During
   this season, the Navy, Coast Guard, and port pilots have cooperated to
   inform ships of whale occurrence. The Navy has installed an acoustic
   array in the coastal waters of Jacksonville and has experimented with a
   towed array along the coast. An "early warning system" on the marine
   radio has been established to inform all mariners immediately of the
   presence and locations of whales. Thus, vessel captains avoid
   collisions and can maintain an efficient speed into and out of the
   ports.

   A citizen and volunteer network augments the work of scientists and
   professionals. Citizens distribute whale alert stickers and posters,
   and give presentations to local clubs and organizations. Beachside
   residents in homes, businesses, and hotels from St. Mary, Georgia to
   Bonyton Beach, Florida monitor the coast and report possible whale
   sightings to the Marine Resources Council (MRC), which monitors the
   public telephone hotline. MRC then conveys the report to the Florida
   DEP. Scientists respond by launching aircraft to confirm the sighting
   and to photograph each animal for identification by scientists from the
   New England Aquarium. The ports, the Navy, and the Coast Guard alert
   shipping interests. The aquarium and scientists from Florida DEP and
   Georgia DNR coordinate surveys.

   Significant Achievements
   Collisions between whales and vessels are avoided; information is
   gathered on Right Whales and vessel movement patterns and speeds to
   establish further avoidance measures for shippers, Corps dredges, and
   Navy and Coast Guard vessels; and the recovery of the whales in these
   waters is fostered. This project has also expanded public awareness and
   increased the use of volunteers from 125 in 1995 to nearly 350 in
   1996-97.

   Coastal America Objectives/Regional Economic Benefit
   This monitoring project of the endangered Right Whales' movements and
   calving ground activities off the northern coast of Florida and
   southern Georgia has contributed significantly to our growing knowledge
   of this species' behavior, while also reducing shipping costs. Because
   the calving grounds are identified and individual animal movements are
   tracked, ships can now chart courses accordingly to maintain speed and
   avoid ship strikes with the Right Whale.
