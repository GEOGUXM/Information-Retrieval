Weather Forecast Products
     __________________________________________________________________

   For your convenience, we are providing links to Internet sites at Ohio
   State and Unisys, which offer a variety of weather-related products
   generated from National Weather Service data. Products at these sights
   are updated every 12 hours. All three sites provide explanatory text on
   many of their products.

   Local Forecast Products
   The zone forecasts are produced at the National Weather Service
   Forecast Office in Albuquerque. The state is divided into 33 zones,
   and, depending on conditions, forecasters will provide detailed
   forecasts for groups of zones that are expected to have similar weather
   over the next 12 to 36 or 48 hours. The local zone forecast for Los
   Alamos is called the "Northwest Mountains, including the Jemez" (zone
   2). All New Mexico Zones is a complete listing of zone forecasts for
   New Mexico. The zone forecasts are updated daily at approximately 4
   a.m., 11 a.m., 4 p.m., and 9 p.m. Weather forecasts heard on the local
   radio stations are usually based on the zone forecasts.
   The temperatures given for each town or city are for the indicated
   forecast periods (e.g., today, tonight, tomorrow). The numbers in the
   precipitation columns are percent probability that measurable
   precipitation will occur somewhere in the forecast area during the
   indicated period.

   Forecasts and Other Reports for the Lower 48 States
   Forecast information, courtesy of OSU, for all states (including New
   Mexico) are given here, with various textual products being offered for
   each state. The products, which vary from state to state, include
   climate information, observations, hydrometeorological data, forecasts,
   model guidance, and public statements, among others.

   Model Forecast Products
   With advances in numerical weather forecasting came a proliferation of
   maps showing how model-calculated variables change in time and space.
   The interpretation of many of these graphical products requires some
   background in meteorology. There are dozens and dozens of products to
   look at. The experienced forecaster knows which ones are important to
   the forecast problems of the day; for example, the set of images one
   consults for a winter storm situation differ from the set one uses for
   predicting the likelihood of convective storms.

   Here, we link to a few images from Ohio State and Unisys. They are easy
   to interpret and will give you a glimpse of what might happen during
   the next 2 1/2 days (60 hours). When differences exist between what the
   maps show and what the state forecast says, go with the state forecast.
   The forecaster in Albuquerque has looked at all the relevant
   information and factored in his or her experience.

   The 24, 36, 48, and 60 hour forecasts are provided by Unisys, and they
   give a detailed explanation about the plots.

   The Forecasted Thunderstorm Probabilities and the Forecasted Snowfall
   Amounts (in season) are provided by Ohio State . These plots are
   statistically generated from the model output of the NGM model at the
   NMC. The thunderstorm probability plot shows the percent chance of
   thunderstorms for the U. S. for 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours into the
   future (from the time of the last NGM model run, shown in the upper
   right hand corner of each panel). The snowfall forecast plot gives
   forecasted snowfall amounts for 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours into the
   future.

   Notice that the products are time stamped in Universal Time; 00 Z on
   December 2 is 1700 MST on December 1, and 12 Z on December 2 is 0500
   MST.

   Long Term Forecasts (1 Month and 3 Months)
   These forecasts are produced by the Climate Predictions Center , which
   is a part of the National Center for Environmental Predictions under
   NOAA. The predictions are formulated using a combination of Canonical
   Correlation Analysis (CCA), Optimal Climate Normals (OCN), and General
   Circulation Model (GCM) forecasts. For more information see the Climate
   Predictions Center homepage.
