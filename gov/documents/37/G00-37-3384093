                  Eradicating Screwworms from North America

                                 [swfly.gif]

   Screwworms, the larvae of the screwworm fly, are parasites that cause
   great damage by entering open wounds and feeding on the flesh of
   livestock and other warmblooded animals, including humans. The pest is
   native to the tropical and sub-tropical areas of North, South, and
   Central America.

   Adult screwworm flies are about twice the size of a housefly and have
   orange eyes and a bluish-green or grey body with three dark stripes
   running down their back.

  Description of the Pest and Pest Damage

   After mating, the female screwworm fly lays her eggs in open wounds.
   One screwworm fly can lay up to 400 eggs at a time, and they can hatch
   into larvae in as little as 12 hours. A single adult female can lay as
   many as 2,800 eggs during its 31-day lifespan. The screwworm larva
   grows inside the wound to greater than one-half inch within 5 to 7 days
   of entering the wound. The full-grown larva then drops from the wound,
   tunnels into the soil, and forms an immobile protective case that
   houses the pupa. An adult screwworm fly emerges from the pupa.

  The Sterile Insect Technique

   Screwworms are eradicated through a form of biological control.
   Millions of sterile screwworm flies are raised in a production plant
   located in Tuxtla Gutierrez in the southern Mexican State of Chiapas
   near the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. During the pupal stage of the fly's
   life cycle, the pupae are subjected to gamma radiation. The level of
   radiation is designed to leave the fly perfectly normal in all respects
   but one: It will be sexually sterile. Thus, when the artificially
   raised flies are released into the wild to mate with native fly
   populations, no offspring will result from the matings. These
   unsuccessful matings lead to the gradual reduction of native fly
   populations. With fewer fertile mates available in each succeeding
   generation, the fly, in essence, breeds itself out of existence.

   From left: (1) The screwworm fly lays her eggs at the edge of a wound
   on a warmblooded animal. (2) Larvae develop in the wound, feeding on
   the living flesh. (3) Mature larvae burrow into the ground where they
   turn into pupae. (4) Adult flies emerge from the pupal stage to mate
   and begin the cycle again.

   The screwworm fly can travel up to 180 miles in several days and under
   warm, favorable conditions can complete a life cycle in as few as 3
   weeks. Left untreated, screwworm-infested wounds lead to death.
   Multiple infestations can kill a grown steer in 5-7 days.

  History of Screwworm Eradication

   As early as 1825, western States reported serious screwworm problems.
   Infestations spread to the Southeast by the 1930's. Losses to livestock
   producers exceeded $400 million annually.

   A plan for eradicating the pest began in the early 1950's, when USDA's
   Agricultural Research Service developed a new control method. Under
   this method, laboratory-raised flies sterilized by gamma rays are
   spread by aircraft over infested areas. As millions of sterile flies
   flood an area, the sterile males mate with fertile female flies. The
   resulting eggs do not hatch. This sterile insect technique was tested
   in a field trial on the Dutch island of Curacao in 1954 and then used
   operationally in Florida in 1957. By 1959, screwworms had been
   eradicated from the Southeast.

   The sterile insect technique was next applied in the more extensively
   infested Southwest starting in 1962. Self-sustaining screwworm
   populations were eliminated from the United States by 1966. A barrier
   zone of sterile flies was set up along the 2,000-mile-long U.S.-Mexican
   border to prevent reinfestation from Mexico. However, constant
   reinfestation from migrating flies or larvae carried by animals, which
   are then transported by people, remained a problem.

   When the sterile flies hatch, they are loaded aboard planes (below) and
   distributed over infested areas to mate with wild flies. Eggs from
   these matings do not hatch and the screwworm literally breeds itself
   out of existence.

   The United States-Mexico Joint Commission was formed in 1972 between
   Mexico and the United States with the goal of eliminating the pest from
   Mexico and pushing the barrier to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, just
   north of Guatemala. A new sterile screwworm plant at Tuxtla Gutierrez,
   Chiapas, Mexico, was dedicated in 1976. With a production capacity of
   more than 500 million sterile flies per week, it replaced the former
   production plant in Mission, Texas, which was closed in January 1981.
   APHIS also is cooperating with Central American countries and Panama in
   efforts eradicate screwworms from those countries and establish and
   maintain a barrier of sterile flies at the Darien Gap between Panama
   and Colombia.

   As a result of these cooperative efforts, Mexico was officially
   declared free of screwworms in 1991, Belize and Guatemala in 1994, and
   El Salvador in 1995. In addition, Honduras is considered technically
   free, with no pest detections since January 1995. Currently, screwworm
   program officials are focusing their efforts on eradicating the pest
   from Nicaragua and Costa Rica. APHIS hopes to begin eradication
   activities in Panama, the final frontier of the program, in 1997.
   Eradication activities include regulation of cattle movement, wound
   treatment, and the release of sterile flies. To date, the program has
   been very successful.

   The screwworm program's resources were strained by introduced outbreaks
   that occurred in Mexico in 1992 and 1993. Of the 66 cases that were
   identified, the closest one was only 121 miles from the U.S. border.
   While these outbreaks were eliminated, the resources that APHIS spent
   in eradicating them pushed back the entire Central American program by
   12 to 18 months.

   As part of the screwworm program's overall strategy, a new sterile fly
   rearing facility in Panama will be established to replace the existing
   one in Mexico. The Panamanian Government has agreed to provide land for
   the new facility. Establishing the new facility well outside the area
   where screwworms have been eradicated will reduce the risk of
   reinfestation through an accidental release of fertile flies.
