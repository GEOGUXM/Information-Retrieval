   Opportunities at CTCMS

   The NIST Center for Theoretical and Computational Materials Science is
   continuously soliciting proposals for
     * Workshops on materials theory and modeling.
     * Short-term and long-term visiting fellowships.
     * Guest researcher and NRC postdoctoral positions.
     * Creative and ambitious new projects in materials theory and
       modeling.

   Postdoctoral Positions at the CTCMS:

   The CTCMS is currently seeking applicants for foreign postdoctoral
   guest researcher positions, and for the NRC Postdoctoral Program.
   Applicants with strong theoretical and/or computational backgrounds in
   phase boundary motion, grain growth, dislocations, liquids, and
   microstructure evolution and characterization are especially encouraged
   to apply. Deadline for submission of proposals to the NRC is near
   January 15, each year. If you are interested in a position with the
   CTCMS, please contact james.warren@nist.gov asap.

   The NIST CTCMS is an equal opportunity employer.

   CTCMS Resident Scholar Program

   The Center for Theoretical and Computational Materials Science at the
   National Institute for Standards and Technology is seeking candidates
   for the CTCMS Resident Scholar program. This program provides funding
   for scientists at all levels to spend time at the Center, where they
   may take advantage of the variety of resources both within the Center
   and at NIST. Researchers with interest in computational and theoretical
   materials science are encouraged to apply. The CTCMS investigates
   industrially relevant problems in materials theory and modeling with
   novel computational approaches, creates novel opportunities for
   collaboration, and develops powerful new tools for materials theory and
   modeling and accelerates their integration into industrial research.

   To apply, please submit the following:

     * Curriculum Vitae
     * Two supporting letters (for graduate students and post-doctoral
       researchers only.)
     * Desired stay
     * Outline of proposed research, including goals and anticipated
       outcome.
     * PROPOSALS SHOULD NOT EXCEED 3 PAGES.

   Proposals will be judged competitively, on a first-come, first-served
   basis. Typical terms in residence are from several weeks to several
   months. The CTCMS will provide travel and living expenses. If
   participation in this program is coincident with sabbatical leave,
   please indicate amount needed.

   Workshops

   The Center for Theoretical and Computational Materials Science at the
   National Institute for Standards and Technology is soliciting proposals
   for workshops in theoretical and computational materials science.
   Typical awards will range from $2K -- $20K; additional funds may be
   requested in certain cases. To apply, please submit the following:

     * Brief description of workshop purpose and format.
     * Potential list of invitees.
     * Goals and anticipated outcome.
     * Detailed budget request.
     * Tentative workshop dates.

   Workshops should focus on methods and/or problems in any areas of
   theoretical and/or computational materials research and should include
   industrial participation. Previous CTCMS workshops have led in many
   cases to the establishment of multi-institutional research teams which
   have received subsequent CTCMS funding.

   Send the proposal to:
