   [SHEBA] The High Altitude Weather Characterization (HAWC) project is
   designed to examine how various cloud types and turbulence aloft affect
   thte quality of radio communications signals that are beamed from
   satellites to the Earth's surface. This U.S. Air Force program extends
   earlier research on how rain affects RF signal quality along
   terrestrial and satellite communication links. Field work for the
   project takes place in Massachusetts in January and Febuary 2000.
   NOAA/ETL will use its NOAA/K cloud radar and MMCR package to monitor
   the characteristics of clouds along and near the satellite-to-ground
   communications link. Microphysical features of the clouds will be
   inferred from the radar/radiometer data using retrieval methods
   developed at ETL and elsewhere. Collaborationg groups in this research
   include ITT Industries, Inc., and MIT 's Lincoln Laborotory.
