   On the trail of the Right Whale
   Mission log
   About the trip
   About the people
   About the whale
   Aerial Surveys

   Over the next four weeks, members of the scientific team will be
   sending dispatches to NOAA headquarters describing their adventures,
   accomplishments, and tribulations. Along with the record of the voyage,
   this Web page will contain right whale photographs and information
   about their behaviors, the technology used on the cruise, and selected
   profiles of the many scientists and staff members contributing to the
   cruise. Reed Bohne, manager of the NOAA's Gray's Reef National Marine
   Sanctuary, serves as author, editor, and coordinator of these
   dispatches.

   Three types of dispatches will be sent. The first, a daily log, is
   accessed through the dated page links on the right. Background pieces,
   such as "Aerial Surveys," are accessed through the page links on the
   left. And finally, every week or two, the team will provide a brief
   summary of events. These will be added to this column.
