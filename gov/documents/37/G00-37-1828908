                    Biosciences and Biotechnology at LLNL

"Working with academia, industry and goverment, we leverage the laboratory's
capabilities in the physical and engineering sciences to conduct biosciences
             and biotechnology research of national importance."

   Use this link for a comprehensive Overview of Biosciences LLNL,
   otherwise you can link to the specific web sites below describing
   research in the areas of Biosciences and Biotechnology.
   Work is carried out both in the Biology and Biotechnology Research
   Program, as well as in other Directorates across the laboratory. The
   Council on Biosciences and Biotechnology cuts across these directorates
   to provide strategic planning.
   Scientists and engineers can work with industrial partners to solve
   unique problems if done through the Industrial Partnering and
   Commercialization (IPAC) office.
