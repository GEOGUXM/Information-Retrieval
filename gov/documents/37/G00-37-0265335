   "The Effects of Globally Transported African and Asian Dust on Coral
   Reef and Human Health" is an eight minute mini-documentary featuring
   biologist Ginger Garrison, geologist Gene Shinn, chemist Chuck Holmes,
   and microbiologist Dale Griffin as they explain the deterioration of
   Caribbean coral health over the past several decades, and how unlocking
   the key role of trans-Atlantic dust transport has opened the door to
   understanding the effects and implications of this global phenomenon.
   Narrated by geologist Terry Edgar.
