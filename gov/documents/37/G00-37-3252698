                       The Amtrak Reform Council Fact Sheet

      The CouncilÂ’s Statutory Charge:

      Amtrak Reform Council (ARC) is an independent federal commission
      established under the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997
      (ARAA), which gave the Council a statutory mandate: (i) to recommend to
      Amtrak actions that the Corporation can take to improve its operational
      and financial performance; (ii) to monitor Amtrak's financial
      performance in the light of both Amtrak's own goals for financial
      performance, as established in its strategic business plan, and the
      statutory requirement that Amtrak be free of the need for operating
      grants after the fifth anniversary of the enactment of the ARAA; and
      (iii) should the Council find that Amtrak has not achieved or will not
      achieve either of its financial targets, then it is to forward to the
      Congress recommendations for a restructured and rationalized national
      intercity rail passenger system.

      To carry out this statutory mandate, ARC will work closely with
      Amtrak's Board and management, the Administration, and the Congress.
      The Council is required to submit an annual report to the Congress, as
      well as reports on Amtrak's use of funds under the Taxpayer Relief Act
      of 1997.
