   KPL's Young Adult (YA) service offers many resources for school work,
   including encyclopedias on computer and SIRS, an electronic database
   with articles on social issues.

   The YA area beckons teens with its collection of paperback books,
   fantasy, science fiction, classics, mysteries, and more!   A Young
   Adult Advisory Group plans a summer reading program and special events.
   New members and ideas are always welcome - talk to YA staff.
