   "Public Service is a Public Trust"
   The Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch
   (5 C.F.R Part 2635) state that federal workers have a responsibility to
   the United States Government and its citizens to place loyalty to the
   Constitution, laws and ethical principles above private gain. Among
   other things, employees are prohibited from holding financial interests
   that conflict with their job duties, engaging in financial transactions
   using nonpublic Government information, or accepting gifts from those
   regulated by the agency. Further, government employees must act
   impartially, protect and conserve federal property, refrain from
   engaging in outside activities, including seeking employment, that
   conflict with official Government duties, and disclose waste, fraud,
   abuse, and corruption to appropriate authorities.
   While DOT employees are recognized for their dedication, honesty, and
   hard-work, like any large organization, there will always be a few who
   will try to personally benefit from their official position. Preventing
   and detecting such waste, fraud, and abuse is a major goal of DOT OIG.
   We believe that it is important to maintain the integrity of federal
   programs and dollars. Any employee who attempts to take advantage of
   their public position adversely affects the reputation and integrity of
   the agency, as well as that of its workforce.
   Depending on the nature and severity of the misconduct, an employee
   found to have engaged in such activity may receive administrative
   sanctions, such as termination, suspension, or reprimand. Cases also
   may be referred to the Department of Justice for possible civil or
   criminal prosecution.
