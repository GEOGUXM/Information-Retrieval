   UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA : MDL NO.
   1355 : IN RE: PROPULSID : SECTION: L PRODUCTS LIABILITY LITIGATION ::
   JUDGE FALLON : MAG. JUDGE AFRICK THIS DOCUMENT RELATES TO ALL CASES ::
   .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
   .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. JOINT REPORT NO. 9 OF PLAINTIFFS' AND
   DEFENDANTS' LIAISON COUNSEL Plaintiffs' Liaison Counsel (PLC) and
   Defendants' Liaison Counsel (DLC) jointly submit this Report No. 9. I.
   Master Complaint/Answer - (PTO 2 - VI(B)) On July 5, 2001 the PLC
   delivered to DLC a draft Master Class Action Complaint. The timing for
   the filing of a Master Complaint and Answer is addressed by the pending
   Motion to Enter Scheduling Order for Motion and Hearing on Class
   Certification that was filed on July 18, 2001. (See paragraph X below).
   PLC objects to the contentions and timing of DLC's proposed
   certification hearing and has filed a brief in opposition. The parties
   will be prepared to discuss this in more detail at the August 3, 2001
   Monthly Status Conference. 1 II. Update of Rolling Document Production
   and Electronic Document Production - (PTO 2 - IX) DLC advises that the
   last production of documents was rolled out on June 29, 2001, with the
   delivery of 423,000 pages on CD-ROM. With this production, the total
   number of pages produced on CD-ROM so far is 3,467,456. PLC and DLC
   have had continued discussions regarding the production of electronic
   data. PLC maintains that the production of electronic data including
   the initial databases is overdue. DLC maintains that it anticipates
   delivering the following databases by Labor Day, subject to an
   agreement or Order providing for the allocation of costs and expenses
   associated with the production of electronic data: 1. CMF (Call Center)
   2. CRF (Clinical Trials) 3. TMF (Clinical Trials) 4. LMD (Literature,
   Links to Trials) 5. ARISg (Safety Database) The parties will be
   prepared to discuss this in more detail at the August 3, 2001 Monthly
   Status Conference. The parties are continuing discussions regarding a
   nominee for Special Master as required by Section H(3) of PTO 10. PLC
   and DLC have agreed to a procedure for imaging hard drives in Beerse,
   Belgium, which included an instructional text and certification
   language providing a method for the procedure and an assurance of
   compliance. 2 PLC has written defense counsel and requested a joint
   inspection (MDL and state court case counsel) of Janssen's computer
   system to view the various data bases that are presently the subject of
   discovery and in line for production. PLC desires to view the data
   bases in operation so that it can understand screen shots and how
   relationships, drop down screens, etc. work on a on-going day-to-day
   basis. DLC objects to an on site inspection, expecting that other
   satisfactory arrangements can be made. The parties will be prepared to
   discuss this in more detail at the August 3, 2001 Monthly Status
   Conference. III. Electronic Service/Verilaw - (PTO 2-IV(C)(C)) The
   parties have agreed to additional security measures requested by
   Verilaw for documents that are served electronically. Verilaw is in the
   process of implementing the upgrade. These measures will be implemented
   soon. IV. State Liaison Counsel - (Minute Entry, November 16, 2000) At
   the invitation of the Court, Mr. David Jacoby will attend the August 3,
   2001 Monthly Status Conference to report on the status of Propulsid
   litigation in New Jersey. The Court has scheduled a meeting with the
   State Liaison Committee to be held following the August 3, 2001 Monthly
   Status Conference. V. Patient Profile Form and Authorization As of
   Friday, July 27, 2001, defendants have received 421 Patient Profile
   Forms (PPFs). Sixty- eight (68) are currently overdue and 49 PPFs will
   become due within thirty (30) days. PLC and DLC continue to communicate
   directly with plaintiff counsel whose PPFs are overdue. As the Court
   had been previously informed, DLC advised that defendants intended to
   present for dismissal at the August 3, 2001 3 Monthly Status
   Conference, the names of plaintiffs who have failed to respond to
   follow-up requests for completion of PPFs. Three Motions have been
   filed in this regard, to dismiss the claims of Mabel Charles, Lucius
   Hinkle, Calvin Aubert, Charlar P. Brewer, James Carter, Katherine
   Clayton, Ta Lacey Clayton, Tracy Clayton, Angelique Mallery, Marquell
   Mitchell, Albert Williams, Sr., Della Williams, Ernestine Williams,
   Katia Williams, Khymest Terre Williams, Lisa Lynette Williams, Shelton
   Williams, Jr., Shelton Williams, Sr. and Tyler James Williams.
   Defendants have since withdrawn the Motions to Dismiss the Claims of
   Brewer and Mallery. DLC and PLC are discussing some alleged general
   deficiencies in some of the responses contained in the PPFs. Parties
   will be prepared to discuss this in more detail at the August 3, 2001
   Monthly Status Conference. VI. Subpoena to FDA On July 13, 2001, PLC
   filed a Motion to Compel Production of Documents from FDA arising out
   of a subpoena duces tecum that had earlier been served on the FDA with
   the return date of March 30, 2001. In response to the subpoena, the FDA
   produced on May 30, 2001 approximately 5,000 pages of documents and
   advised that an additional 11 cartons were to be produced. Since filing
   the Motion, the ensuing discussions with FDA indicate that the FDA
   would complete the production by the end of August, 2001.
   Correspondence received from Paige Taylor from the FDA dated July 18,
   2001 is attached, which identifies the individuals within the FDA who
   are responsible for gathering the documents subpoenaed. Additional
   correspondence received from Paige Taylor from the FDA dated July 26,
   2001 is attached, which outlines the production schedule for the
   remaining FDA documents. Under those circumstances, PLC advised the FDA
   that it would not pursue the Motion to Compel at the August 3, 2001
   Monthly 4 Status Conference pending completion of the document
   production by the end of August. VII. Service List of Attorneys The
   parties will present the Court with the most current Master List of all
   Counsel, which will contain, where available, e-mail addresses. VIII.
   Ongoing Studies/Subpoena to BevGlen PLC issued a subpoena duces tecum
   to BevGlen Medical Systems Corporation of Delaware, through their
   Authorized Agent for Service of Process, United Corporation Services,
   15 East North Street, Dover, Delaware 19901. The subpoena requested,
   among other things, production of studies regarding Cisapride, on July
   27, 2001. PLC and DLC have agreed to discuss the production of
   materials responsive to this request, the relevance of the materials
   and any confidentiality issues. This subpoena also raises the issue of
   the production of scientific data involved in an ongoing study, which
   has been the subject of prior discussions between PLC and DLC and which
   has been periodically reported to the Court. The parties will attempt
   to negotiate a recommended order providing for the scientific studies
   that may not yet be completed, studies which are completed, and the
   preservation of all data, including raw data, utilized in connection
   with all studies. IX. Third Party Subpoena Duces Tecum Issued by PSC
   PLC and DLC have been in negotiations in an attempt to coordinate
   production responses from third party subpoenas. PLC and DLC are
   discussing the creation of a protocol to enable efficient and
   economical production of information received from third parties to
   which subpoenas are issued. In this context, on July 6, 2001, DLC
   forwarded a draft Pretrial Order providing for production of documents
   from third parties. On July 18, 2001, PLC responded with a redraft of a
   Pretrial Order for third party 5 subpoenas. PLC is waiting on a reply
   from DLC. PLC and DLC continue to discuss refining this Order for
   presentation to the Court and will be prepared to discuss the remaining
   issues surrounding the preparation of such an Order. X. Motion to Enter
   Scheduling Order for Motion and Hearing on Class Certification.
   Defendants filed the above Motion on July 18, 2001, and on July 30,
   2001 the Plaintiffs' Steering Committee filed a Memorandum in response
   and in opposition. Counsel will be prepared to make brief oral argument
   and answer questions from the Court. XI. Tolling Agreement/Master
   Complaint of Louisiana Propulsid Claimants By agreement of the parties,
   plaintiffs filed a Master Complaint of Louisiana Propulsid Claimants
   and a First Supplemental and Amended Master Complaint of Louisiana
   Propulsid Claimants on July 13, 2001 and July 16, 2001, respectively.
   The purpose of filing these Complaints was to provide a procedural
   mechanism to interrupt prescription. All of the defendants' rights are
   otherwise reserved and not waived. The complaint, as amended will be
   placed on the Court's inactive docket pending further orders of the
   Court. No discovery shall take place as regards these plaintiffs, who,
   while on the inactive docket, are not governed by Pretrial Order No. 9.
   In the meantime, the defendants will raise their objection at the
   August 3, 2001 Monthly Status Conference to the naming of "John Doe"
   and "Jane Doe" plaintiffs in the aforementioned Complaints. XII.
   Plaintiffs' and Defendants' Respective Requests for Production of
   Documents On May 8, 2001, PLC served a copy of Plaintiffs Merits
   Request for Production of Documents 6 Propounded to Defendants - Set
   No. 2. This Request sought production of documents regarding
   Norcisapride. On July 20, 2001, defendants served their response and
   objections. Defendants are prepared to produce some materials reserving
   their relevancy objections and plan on continued discussions with PLC
   to address issues of confidentiality and burdensomeness. The parties
   will be prepared to discuss these matters at the August 3, 2001 Monthly
   Status Conference. On May 22, 2001, defendants served their Request for
   Production of Documents Propounded to Plaintiffs - Set No. One: Ongoing
   Studies. On July 9, 2001, counsel representing the Plaintiffs' Steering
   Committee filed a response. No response has been forthcoming from other
   plaintiff counsel, and in compliance with Local Rule 37.1 and Pretrial
   Order No. 2, Paragraph VIII(a), DLC will schedule a telephone
   conference call for plaintiff counsel who have not responded. On June
   5, 2001, defendants served their Request for Production of Documents
   Propounded to Plaintiffs - Set No. Two. Defendants are awaiting
   response. XIII. Agenda A proposed Agenda for the August 3, 2001 Monthly
   Status Conference is attached. Respectfully submitted, RUSS M. HERMAN,
