   While wheat researchers are familiar with the existence of the Russian
   monograph of Triticum L. (Dorofeev et al.1979), this important
   taxonomic work is unavailable to the majority of them because of the
   language barrier. Acceptance also has been problematic because the
   monograph follows a traditional treatment concept that recognizes all
   morphological forms of wild and domesticated wheats and excludes the
   wild species of Aegilops L. This taxonomic approach had already fallen
   out of favor by the time of its publication in 1979. Thus, Dorofeev et
   al. has remained in relative obscurity under the dominating influence
   of the genetic concept of the wheat complex as embodied in the
   treatments of Morris & Sears (1967), Kimber & Sears (1987) and Kimber &
   Feldman (1987).

   Taxonomy is usually a minor concern for wheat geneticists. However, it
   promises to play a significant role in the protection of germplasm
   diversity and intellectual property rights, issues of growing
   importance in the developing research arena and commercial markets of
   biotechnology. By virtue of its detailed morphological classification,
   Dorofeev et al. has direct application to all aspects of biodiversity
   research  i.e., preservation, cataloguing, and utilization. This
   monograph provides the only comprehensive worldwide catalogue of all
   known infraspecific taxa of cultivated and wild wheat species. It is
   the culmination of a significant scientific effort that dates back to
   the time of Vavilovs leadership of the systematic wheat research in
   Russia. Dorofeev et al. can serve as an authoritative reference for
   both identifying distinct forms of wild and domesticated wheat and
   challenging the validity of proprietary claims on wheat genes and
   genetic lines that rightfully belong within the public domain.

   The scientific value of Dorofeev et al. should not be underestimated.
   To produce such a taxonomic monograph de novo would be extremely
   difficult in the current research funding climate. Additionally, the
   combined knowledge and expertise of its authors cannot now be
   reproduced. An English version would open a wealth of information to
   botanists, plant breeders, geneticists, genebank managers, and others
   in the wheat research community. The 25 species and 1,242 infraspecific
   taxa described in Dorofeev et al. are fully catalogued with botanical
   descriptions, taxonomic keys, geographic distribution, disease traits,
   origin, and history. In nomenclature, Dorofeev et al. is unique among
   the modern taxonomic treatments of Triticum for its detailed synonymy
   and comprehensive compilation of names  over 3000 names for the wheats
   are listed in the index.

   This project evolved from informal discussions that took place in July
   1999 during the Percival Symposium (Wheat  Yesterday, Today and
   Tomorrow; University of Reading, UK). Our goal is to finance a quality
   translation that will be published at an affordable price. Any profits
   made from an English version of Dorofeev et al. will go into a fund for
   translation of other significant Russian scientific publications
   dealing with wheat. In February 2000, permission to proceed with the
   English translation was obtained from the Vavilov Institute (VIR, St.
   Petersburg, Russia), the holder of the copyright to the Russian edition
   of Dorofeev et al. A translator has been identified and various options
   for publication are currently being explored.

   CIMMYT recently pledged $ 5000 to the project fund established to
   finance the translation and publication. We are posting this
   announcement to alert the research community of the need for this
   English translation and to ask for donations to the project fund. A
   minimum of $ 5000 in matching funds will be required to support the
   costs of translation and publication. We encourage donations (in US $)
   from individuals and research entities to be sent to [to be added
   later]. These contributions will be duly acknowledged in the published
   translation.
