Search Help

     To find information about a topic, simply type in a few keywords.
     The more detailed your query, the more relevant your results.
     Our search engine also comes with some advanced capabilities to help
     you find exactly what you're looking for. These capabilities are
     best shown with a few examples:

   +CGI +scripting_________________________
          Translated: require CGI, require scripting
          Finds "CGI Scripting", "CGI scripting", and "scripting of type
          CGI".
          Does not find the lowercase "cgi scripting", nor the abbreviated
          "CGI script".

   -CGI +scripts___________________________
          Translated: forbid CGI, require scripts
          Finds "Perl scripts", "Hollywood scripts", and lowercase "cgi
          scripts".
          Does not find "CGI definitions" nor "CGI scripts".

   or CGI and scripts______________________
          Translated: prefer CGI, require scripts
          Finds "Perl scripts", "CGI scripts", and "CGI Scripts".
          Documents with both terms appear higher in the list.

   "CGI scripts"___________________________
          Translated: require the phrase "CGI scripts"
          Finds "CGI scripts".
          Does not find "CGI Scripts" nor "scripts of type CGI".

   and cgi and script*_____________________
          Translated: require cgi (case insensitive), require words
          starting with "script"
          Finds "CGI scripts", "cgi scripting", "Cgi scripter".
          The asterisk is a wildcard representing any four or fewer
          characters.

   not planet and Venus and pictures or ima
          Translated: require Venus (case sensitive), require pictures,
          forbid planet, prefer images
          First lists "pictures and images of Venus", then "Venus
          pictures".
          Does not list lowercase "venus picture", nor forbidden "picture
          of planet Venus".

   Where is the *frog*?____________________
          Translated: ignores common words like where, is, and the -
          requires words containing "frog"
          Finds "frog", "frogleg", and "bullfrog".
          To suppress the ignore feature, use quotes, as in "Where is the
          *frog*?".

     Note on case sensitivity - only words or phrases containing an upper
     case character will be treated as case sensitive. Powered by
     Xavatoria A search on "usa" will match "Usa", "USA", and "usA",
     while the term "USA" matches only its uppercase version.
     The asterisk is a powerful search tool, but has some limitations. It
     cannot span words - that is, the query "powerfu*earch" would not
     match the first sentence of this paragraph - and it can represent at
     most four letters or numbers. To avoid overly broad searches, the
     asterisk can only be used in words or phrases which have at least
     three alpha-numeric characters. A search for "th*" would be ignored.
