                 Future Directions for Far-Infrared Sources
                      2000 ALS Users' Meeting Workshop
                              October 18, 2000
                              Room 4-102B, LBNL

   This workshop will investigate the science that could drive a new
   synchrotron-based far-infrared (> 30 micrometer) program at the ALS.
   Topics will emphasise the far-IR research that could be enhanced by
   such a facility. Since the evolution of such a program involves source
   development, workshop topics will also include measurements of and
   proposals for producing coherent high-brightness far-IR from a storage
   ring. Attendees will have the opportunity to help guide the design and
   discuss potential scientific applications for a new far-IR synchrotron
   facility.

   Summary: Here is a Summary of the workshop.
