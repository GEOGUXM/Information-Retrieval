   "The American system of trial by jury is unique. No other nation relies
    so heavily on ordinary citizens to make its most important decisions
   about law, business practice, and personal libertyÂ—even death. Ideally,
    Americans take their participation seriously lest they someday stand
                    before their peers seeking justice."
                  -Stephen J. Adler, journalist and author.
