   Welcome
   The NIH FOIA office handles three different categories of requests:
     * requests for information maintained by the Office of the Director,
       NIH
     * requests that will involve responses from more than one NIH
       Institute or Division
     * requests for information that will not be released because it is
       protected by one or more of the FOIA's nine exemptions or three
       exclusions

   While all requests may be sent to the NIH FOIA office, each of NIH's
   separate Institutes and Centers has its own FOIA Coordinator.
   Requesters are encouraged to direct requests for information about a
   specific NIH component to that component. A list of the FOIA
   Coordinators for each component is available at this site for your
   convenience.

   Background/Overview

   The Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA"), 5 U.S.C. 552, provides
   individuals with a right to access to records in the possession of the
   federal government. The government may withhold information pursuant to
   the nine exemptions and three exclusions contained in the Act. The
   Electronic FOIA ("E-FOIA") Amendments which President Clinton signed
   into law in 1996, amended the law in several ways, including:

     * extend from 10 to 20 business days (excluding holidays) the time
       agencies must respond to requests for information;
     * require agencies to make reasonable efforts to make records
       available in formats desired by requesters;
     * require agencies to submit the NIH FOIA Annual Report by fiscal
       year;
     * require agencies to make the reports available to the public by
       computer telecommunicationsor other electronic means;
     * require agencies to list their major information systems, record
       locator systems, and a reference guide or guide for obtaining
       information; and
     * require agencies to establish electronic reading rooms that include
       agency policies, staff manuals, opinions made in the adjudication
       of cases, and an index of records released by FOIA that are likely
       to become the subject of subsequent FOIA requests.
     * these amendments have to be implemented by specific dates.


                                                                 Up to Top

   Guide for Submitting FOIA Requests

   Before submitting FOIA requests, individuals should ensure that the
   information they seek is not already in the public domain. Each of
   NIH's components has information available in both published format and
   electronically. A search of the NIH Home Page can assist requesters in
   locating information and lists of available publications. Such a search
   can also help requesters identify the component(s) most likely to have
   responsive documents so FOIA requests can be sent to the appropriate
   component for response. A list of the NIH Institutes and Centers is
   available at this site to assist you. A list of the FOIA Coordinators
   for each component is available at this site for your convenience. FOIA
   requesters interested in obtaining information on federally funded
   biomedical research projects should consult the Computer Retrieval of
   Information on Scientific Projects (CRISP) database. This will enable
   requesters to identify the grant number and the component funding the
   research in their FOIA request.

   Recently the Office of Management and Budget issued final revisions to
   Circular A110 to provide for access to data produced under grants
   awarded by the National Institutes of Health and other federal awarding
   agencies. To the extent you are interested in requesting data produced
   under a National Institutes of Health grant pursuant to the provisions
   of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Revised Circular A110, please
   understand that the provisions of Revised Circular A110 apply to data:

     * first produced under a new or competing continuing grant awarded
       after the Department of Health and Human Services amends 45 C.F.R.
       74 to incorporate the changes mandated by the Revised Circular; and
     * cited publicly and officially by the Federal Government in support
       of an agency action that has the force and effect of law.

   In addition, if the data you request are already available to the
   public through an archive or other source, we will not process your
   request under the FOIA. In that situation, we will refer you to the
   archive or other source.

   More information regarding NIH implementation of Revised Circular A110
   may be found at
   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/a110/a110_guidance_dec1999.htm.

   If the information is not in the public domain, please follow the
   suggestions listed below when preparing your FOIA request:
     * identify the records requested (be as specific as possible, i.e.,
       describe the subject matter of the records, and, if known, indicate
       the dates of the records, the places where they originated, and the
       names of the originating persons or offices);
     * state that the records are requested under the Freedom of
       Information Act;
     * include daytime telephone numbers in case additional information is
       needed before answering requests; and
     * forward all requests to the NIH FOIA Office by one of the methods
       listed below:
     * if you are requesting data produced under an NIH grant, include the
       following information in your request:
          + the federal regulation or administrative order that cited the
            data being requested;
          + the publication and/or reference cited in the federal
            regulation;
          + the grant number under which the data were produced (this
            information can be obtained from the CRISP database;
          + a description of the data sought; and
          + a statement that the data are being requested under OMB
            Revised Circular A110.
     * Mail the request (mark the outside of the envelope, "FOIA Request")
       to: Freedom of Information Office, NIH
       Building 31, Room 2B39
       9000 Rockville Pike
       Bethesda, MD 20892
     * OR Fax the request to the FOIA Office at (301) 402-4541.

   Individuals with questions concerning their requests may call the NIH
   FOIA Staff at (301)-496-5633.

   If the requester knows which component has responsive documents, the
   FOIA request should be sent directly to the FOIA Coordinator for that
   component. A list of the FOIA Coordinators for NIH components and their
   addresses is included at this site.


                                                                 Up to Top

   Guide for Submitting FOIA Appeals
   FOIA requesters may appeal the denial of information within 30 days of
   receipt of letters from the agency. Appeals should state the following
   information:

     * the reasons why the requested information should be released under
       the Act; and
     * why the denial may be in error.

   FOIA requesters shall attach copies of their original requests and
   response letters to all appeals, clearly mark the letters and the
   outside envelopes, "FOIA Appeal, " and mail appeals to the following
   address:

   Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (Media)
   U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
   Parklawn Building, Room 13C-24
   5600 Fishers Lane
   Rockville, MD 20857


                                                                 Up to Top

   Fees
   The Freedom of Information Act provides for the agency to recover part
   of the cost associated with responding to a request. The Department
   Regulations set out the specific rules for fees and for requesting a
   fee waiver or a reduction in fees. Some general principles apply to all
   requests such as:
     * if you are going to request a fee waiver or a reduction in fees,
       you must do so when you file your initial request for documents.
     * you may be charged for search time even if we do not locate any
       documents responsive to your request or if the documents we locate
       are denied to you under one of the FOIA's exemptions.
     * there will not be a charge if the cost of responding to your
       request is less than $25.

   If a determination is made that fees will be charged, the following fee
   schedule will be used to calculate the exact cost of search and review
   time:
     * if the work is performed by an agency employee Grade 1-8, you will
       be charged $17 an hour for each 15 minutes worked.
     * if the work is performed by an agency employee Grade 9-14, you will
       be charged $34 an hour for each 15 minutes worked.
     * if the work is performed by an agency employee Grade 15 or above,
       you will be charged $61 an hour for each 15 minutes worked.

   In addition, if you are requesting data produced under a NIH grant
   under the provisions of OMB Revised Circular A110, you will be charged
   a reasonable fee equaling the full incremental cost of obtaining the
   data. This fee will reflect the costs incurred by NIH, the grantee
   institution and the grantee investigator. These fees will be in
   addition to any fees assessed by NIH under the FOIA.


                                                                 Up to Top

   Exemptions
   The Freedom of Information Act provides that the agency will provide
   access to identifiable documents within our possession unless one of
   nine exemptions or three exclusions applies. The exact language of the
   exemptions can be found in the FOIA. Additional guidance on the
   exemptions and how they apply to certain documents can be found in the
   Department Regulation implementing the FOIA.


                                                                 Up to Top

   Electronic Reading Room
   Each of NIH's Institutes and Centers has many documents on-line. You
   may want to review their pages for information.
