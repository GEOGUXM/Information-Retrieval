         Accounting System
     __________________________________________________________________

     The CORE Accounting System (CORE) is an on-line real time
     mainframe        application that performs the core financial
     management functions for eight OPDIVs within the Department of
     Health and Human Services.

     CORE is a fully operational Standard General Ledger accounting
     system which accept batch and on-line inputs, performs accounting
     edits and validations for these inputs and produces accounting
     transactions for the general ledger and its subsidiary ledgers. The
     system includes accounting for funded and unfunded costs,
     obligations, disbursements, advances, receivables, the accrual of
     expenses and revenues, and the administrative control of funds.
     Financial reporting is accomplished by hard copy reports, on-line
     queries and on-line reports.

     The CORE consists of three components, the CORE GL and its subsidary
     ledgers, the Accounts Payable and Budget Modules. Account Payable
     Module is integrated with the CORE in performing document matching
     for authorizing a payment and also does the following routines, ACH
     and check payments, passes automated payment transaction to CORE,
     1099 reporting, prompt payment requirements, tracks payment status
     and does other cash management controls. The Budget Module satisfies
     the OMB Circular A 34 that enables Budget users to prepare and print
     the OMB Apportionment Schedules and the Departmental Advice of
     Allotments and Allowances while creating automated accounting
     transactions which are passed to CORE
