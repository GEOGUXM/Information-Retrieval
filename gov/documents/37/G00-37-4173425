      Brief Biographical Information:

      Professor of Geophysics, University of Alaska
      Royal Technical University of Denmark '65, M.Sc.

      Research:

      Professor Nielsen has a research background in auroral and
      magnetospheric physics. At the institute, he has worked mainly in
      auroral research. During the last 10 years, he has been engaged in
      chemical release experiements, notably the barium shaped-charge program
      and in auroral work. Professor Nielsen also is teaching graduate and
      undergraduate courses within the Department of Physics.

      Sequence of high-speed imager data from a sprite event at 05:10:38.605
      UT, 18 August 1999. Example of high-frame rate images of a sprite, a
      lightning phenomenon between clouds and upper atmosphere. The images
      show that the lightning starts around 74 km altitude and then develops
      both downward and upward. More information: Sprites and Possible
      Mesospheric Effects What are Sprites and Elves

      Research on Leonid MAC:

      First attempt at high-frame rate imaging of meteors using a digital,
      low-light-level, 1000 frame per second intensified CCD imager developed
      by the Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks. The
      digital images are 256x256 pixels at 8 bit (256 gray levels) and the
      field of view is 6.4x6.4 degrees.  The instrument responds to light at
      wavelengths 500-900 nm with maximum sensitivity at 700 nm.
