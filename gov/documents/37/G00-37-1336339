   Databases:
     * The IGBST was responsible for maintaining the long-term databases
       for research and monitoring in the GYE.  All datasets associated
       with this activity were updated and complete. These included
       telemetry relocations, mortality, reproduction, whitebark pine,
       carcass surveys, moth site activity, conflicts, occupancy,
       collaring and handling, life histories, observation flights,
       unduplicated female with cubs of the year counts, radio
       frequencies, cutthroat trout and DNA
     * The Greater Yellowstone place-based science project produced a wide
       range of databases for multiple applications, including climate
       databases, maps depicting land ownership, administration,
       transportation, and development status, GPS datasets from surveying
       roads, motorized vehicle use data including all terrain vehicles,
       satellite imagery data sets and derived products, LIDAR elevation

   Maps:
     * The IGBST produced maps of grizzly bear denning habitat in the
       Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, current and historic distribution of
       the grizzly bear in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, overlap of
       grizzly bear denning habitat and snowmachine activity on National
       Forest lands in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, and known
       grizzly bear-cutworm moth feeding sites in the Greater Yellowstone
       Ecosystem.
     * Made an inventory of Geographic Information System (GIS) data and
       provided maps to the Grays Lake, Red Rock Lakes, and Lost trail
       National Wildlife Refuges.  Such maps include mosaic of detailed
       quadrangle maps, watershed delineations, wetland units, ownership,
       hydrology, and digital elevation models.
