   Introduction:

   Equipment maintenance cost billions of dollars annually and equipment
   down time is a major impediment to improving productivity.  The Center
   for Systems Reliability (CSR) is developing new tools and methodologies
   to improve maintenance strategies and decrease equipment down time.
       Predictive Maintenance
       Predictive maintenance can be defined as the ability to estimate
       the likelihood of an equipment failure over some future time
       interval so that problems can be identified and maintenance
       performed before the failure occurs.  CSR's approach to providing a
       predictive capability is to combine real-time data from sensors
       imbedded in the equipment with a  Windows-based reliability
       analysis tool, WinR-PdM혲.
       Spares Optimization
       Maintaining an adequate spares inventory, while crucial for
       minimizing equipment down time, can also be very expensive.  CSR's
       WinR혲 can be used to develop an optimal spares inventory.  By
       "optimal"  we mean an inventory that results in the greatest
       reduction in equipment down time for the lowest cost.

       Maintenance Cost Analysis
       While equipment maintenance is a major cost factor for most
       production operations, it is seldom quantified.  More importantly,
       few companies take the time to identify the key contributors to
       maintenance cost.  CSR's WinR-DP혲 software tool can help quantify
       equipment maintenance cost as well as identifying the top
       contributors to total cost.
       Failure Data Analysis
       There are several metrics by which we determine equipment
       performance such as mean time between failures (MTBF), availability
       (the probability the equipment is available for use when needed),
       down time (the time that equipment should be operating but is not),
       or cost.   Improving equipment performance may involve improving
       any or all of these metrics.   CSR's WinR-DP혲 software can be used
       to quantify these metrics and determine key contributors to all of
       them.
