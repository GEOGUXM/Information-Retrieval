   OBJECTIVES:
   Develop smart diagnostic software and tools for 1) space biology
   research and 2) medical care and treatment on long space flights.

   To develop these tools in a realistic environment and as a technology
   spin-off application, we are developing smart diagnostic software and
   tools to increase the safety, accuracy and efficiency of neurosurgery
   operations.

   Neurosurgery procedures are currently performed using surgical tools
   that have limited or no sensing capability at the tools tip, typically
   guided only by a pre-operative MRI or CT scan. One of the dangers is
   tearing a blood vessel in the surgical tools path, causing a disabling
   or possibly fatal stroke. Moreover, neurological deficits may arise if
   the surgeon removes or treats more tissue than is necessary. The
   robotic neurosurgery device is a minimally invasive probe equipped with
   multiple microsensors at its tip. As the probe is inserted into tissue,
   the microsensors measure the signal signature of the tissue encountered
   while the smart software characterizes, analyzes and identifies the
   tissue type in real time. If a blood vessel is in its path, probe
   insertion is automatically stopped. Using multimodality sensing and
   high dimensional characterization, it may be possible to accurately
   detect a tumors margin or a specific nucleus in the brain (to treat
   movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease). The robotic
   neurosurgery device is equipped with mechanical stops to ensure that
   the probe only travels to a limited depth in the brain. The robotic
   neurosurgery Smart Probe device is mounted on a standard neurosurgery
   stereotactic device to perform precise movements and positioning, a
   task that is very difficult to achieve by hand.
