Philosophy

   The next physics run of the Tevatron in colliding mode is scheduled to
   begin in the year 2000. The Fermilab Theoretical Physics Department in
   association with the two collider experiments CDF and D0 has organized
   a series of workshops which we hope will help maximize the potential of
   the Tevatron for collider Run II and Run III. Everyone is welcome to
   participate. There are five workshops to running between January 1998
   and January 2000. Within each workshop there are working groups
   organized jointly by theoretical conveners and a contact person from
   each experiment. The direction and scope of the individual working
   groups is the responsibility of the conveners and contact persons. For
   an example of the structure see the home page of the SUSY/Higgs
   workshop below.

Workshops:

     * Supersymmetry/Higgs
     * [thinkshoprim2.gif]   Top physics
     * New strong dynamics
     * QCD and weak boson physics
     * B physics

The yellow book road

   The structure of the workshops will be loosely modeled on the Physics
   at LEP II workshop held at CERN and each workshop should result in a
   document (similar to the yellow books produced at CERN).
