   Welcome to the Recruiting and Retention site. Material here has been
   assembled from many sources. It is provided for use as part of your
   unit's continuing Recruiting and Retention efforts.

   All of us need to tell potential members about what it means to be a
   CAP member and refer quality applicants to local squadrons whenever
   possible.

                              HOW YOU CAN HELP:
     * Share Civil Air Patrol opportunities with potential members
     * Help tell the Civil Air Patrol story
     * Introduce or refer potential members to a local Squadron
     * Encourage members to volunteer for recruiting opportunities

   Additionally, we all need to help maintain public support for the Civil
   Air Patrol. We do this by keeping people informed as to what we do and
   how we do it. Provided here are links, which quickly and easily put you
   in touch with information and products related to Recruiting and
   Retention.

   The site will be updated on a regular basis and changes/additions
   announced via the MN Wing E-mail Announcements List and over CAP Radio
   Nets.

   Should you need any additional information about this site or about the
   Wing's Recruiting and Retention program, please contact the Wing
   Recruiting Officer.
