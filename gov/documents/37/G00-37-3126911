         Several of NASA's Commercial Space Centers (CSCs) and Industrial
         Partners are Joining in the Fight Against Terrorism:

 NASA Food Technology Commercial Space Center (FTCSC) is working with
 its commercial partners to find ways to combat the bioterrorism issues
 facing our country. These issues range from anthrax infecting the
 United States Postal Service to the threat of bioterrorism infecting
 our livestock and food supplies.

 Anthrax
 After the United States Postal Service (USPS) discovered anthrax at
 several of their processing facilities, Dr. Ali Demirci, FTCSC, was
 contacted about the possibility of decontaminating letters that are
 sent through the mail. Dr. Demirci is exploring the use of a Pulsed UV
 system to inactivate the Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis
 bacterial spores, which are non-toxic indicator organisms that are
 similar to Bacillus anthracis (anthrax). If this research is found to
 be a success, it will be a good indication of whether or not the Pulse
 UV system can neutralize anthrax spores as well.

 Dr. Jim Dickson, FTCSC, has also researched ways to combat anthrax at
 the Postal Service. He recently concluded experiments to determine the
 irradiation decimal reduction values (D10s) for dry anthrax spores in
 #10 business envelopes. Dr. Dickson's results showed a 90 percent kill
 per decimal reduction value. The Surgeon General's Office asked Dr.
 Dickson to find the dosage required to kill anthrax spores that might
 be present in envelopes. The research results were sent to the Surgeon
 General.

 Rocky Mountain Resources, a Corporate Founding Partner of FTCSC, is
 using the Microbial-Vac SystemÂ™ (M-Vac) to research ways to detect
 anthrax on letters and packages. The M-Vac is used to collect dry
 powder samples from surfaces of unopened envelopes by going through the
 small opening at the edge of the sealed envelope. The M-Vac can also
 collect samples from the outsides of envelopes and boxes with low
 levels of liquid and can collect 10-20 times more anthrax surrogate (B.
 subtilis) than a wet cotton swab.

 Livestock and Food Supplies
 Iowa State University's Dr. Thomas Richard, FTCSC, is involved in a
 study to prepare our country against a possible threat of livestock
 contamination, such as Mad Cow Disease. Dr. Richard is planning a
 catastrophic mortality composting study in conjunction with the Iowa
 Department of Natural Resources. This study would outline a plan for
 dealing with an attack on the livestock industry - whether natural or
 as part of a bioterrorism attack.

 The threat of bioterrorism in post-production food products is also a
 concern of FTCSC. Dr. Rong Murphy is currently involved in a project to
 eliminate pathogens from packaged ready-to-eat meat products if tainted
 by an act of terrorism.
