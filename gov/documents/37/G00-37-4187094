Overview

   The LBNL Image Library provides an image management service to the LBNL
   community. Its goals are to allow quick, protected and platform
   independent access and manipulation of collections of large digital
   images, especially those on the LBNL Mass Storage System (MSS).

   To achieve these goals a set of small thumbnail versions of each large
   image is derived and stored locally. Also a text description of each
   image called a tag file is associated with each image. These files can
   be browsed, searched or selected for later reference. Whenever a
   thumbnail is displayed the larger images and complete text information
   can be easily retrieved. Access to the images can be restricted by the
   collection owner to specific users or groups or it may be open to
   anyone.

   All access and manipulation of the derived images and text takes place
   via a WWW interface. The WWW interface provides platform independence
   and easy evolution of the system to meet new needs.

   An introduction to the use and appearance of the Image Library can be
   found in the Image Library Introduction. A description of the goals and
   design in greater depth can be found in the project plan document and
   project design document for the Image Library.

Using a Collection
[thin_green.gif]

Browsing

   Browsing starts from the INDEX TO ALL COLLECTIONS option on the Home
   page. Collections are arranged hierarchically so many of the top level
   collections only contain sub-collections. Selecting search at the top
   of a collection will present a form which can be used to search over
   all the text files in the collection.

   Once a collection is encountered that contains images, you are given a
   pull-down menu of the following choices: browse, image_browse and
   search. The browse option will display a thumbnail (whose size you
   select with the icon size menu) and various links to different images
   sizes and text information. It uses a table format to display this
   information, so if you are not using a browser that understands tables,
   e.g. Netscape, use the image_browse option instead. Image_browse will
   just display the thumbnail images (linked to the text/image display
   page). This option gives a more densely packed but less informative way
   of viewing a collection. Clicking on an image gives more information
   about the image.

   The search option will give you another form on which to input the word
   or words that you want searched for. If a collection includes
   sub-collections the text files in all the sub-collections will be
   searched.

Searching

   The Image Library uses the Glimpse search engine from the University of
   Arizona. This program searches a word based index which contains a
   entry for most every word in the set of text files that is being
   searched. This index contains pointers to each block in which the word
   appears. When a match is found in the index each matching file is
   searched using agrep. Glimpse supports case sensitive or insensitive
   matching, whole or partial word matches, misspellings, boolean and/or
   searching and all the wild-card functions of the grep family.

   The collection owner must manually trigger the creation the glimpse
   index for a collection whenever the tags files are changed. The Create
   Glimpse Index option on the Add/Edit page (under Curators Interface)
   does this. Individual sub-collections and/or tree of sub-collections
   can be indexed. The collection in which a search is initiated
   determines what index is searched.

Selecting Images

   The browse window gives you an option to select images for later
   processing. The selection list is simply a list of images from various
   collections which is kept under your userid or machine name for up to
   12 hours. In most cases you are able to specify the name of the list as
   either your userid or the name of the machine you are connecting from.
   Using your userid is preferable since it will eliminate confusion that
   can occur if more than one user accesses the Image Library from the
   same remote client. You can view the current contents of your selection
   list from the browse pages and the global edit page by clicking on the
   scroll icon. [scroll.gif]

   The selection list can be used to create a list of files for global
   editing, local editing, moving, deleting, and staging on the Mass
   Storage System, or just for future reference. If the original images
   reside on the Mass Storage System (MSS), and you know that you are
   going to want to view a number of them, it will save time to stage them
   before you try to view them. Staging brings images in from the MSS tape
   archive to its disk cache. Note that it does not move the file either
   to the Image Library server machine or to your client machine. Staging
   files as a group saves both MSS time and your time. The MSS will get
   all the files that are on one tape off the tape at the same time rather
   than having to mount the tape each time an individual file is
   retrieved. Once the staging has been completed, you can view or
   retrieve an image in just the time it takes to move the image from the
   MSS to your machine, without encountering the 5-10 minutes wait that it
   can take for the file to be brought in off tape.

Creating and Maintaining a Collection

Collection Description

   The following information is kept about each collection.
     * Owners name
     * The directory containing the original high resolution images
     * Default icon size for the browse or search pages
     * Information on the format of the derived images
     * Access group that may read the derived images
     * Access group that may read the high-resolution images
     * Access group that may modify the collection
     * A description of the collection
     * A set of tags and default values for the Tag files
     * A Glimpse index of all the text files

   The derived images may be gif or jpeg format. jpeg files are about 1/10
   to 1/2 the size of a gif file depending on what "quality" metric you
   chose. Higher numbers give better quality, but create bigger files. Not
   all browsers support in-line jpegs. Netscape, Internet Explorer, Mosaic
   and HotJava all do. There is a collection of sample jpeg and gif images
   in the collection JPEG_EXAMPLES if you would like to see how they will
   look with your favorite browser. In my experience, jpeg down to quality
   50 looked as good as gif viewed with Netscape on a Unix machine, but
   not as good when viewed with Netscape on a Mac.

  Access Control

   The access groups and users are defined by the Image Library software
   and are independent of Unix users who have accounts on the server
   machine. Any collection owner can create new users or groups for his
   collections. There are links to the Add user/group form under the
   Curators Interface. Users and groups must exist before they can used to
   control access to a collection. The default group for read access is
   all (all lower case). This allows anyone to read the images without
   authentication. The default user to modify the collection is the user
   who is creating the collection.

   If the high-resolution images are kept on the machine on which the
   Image Library server is running, it will use the high-resolution access
   group to control read access to them. If the images are on the Mass
   Storage System, the MSS Server, an HTTP server running on the MSS
   machine. will control access. There is a link from the Image Library
   Curators Interface page to Export file from Mass Storage which connects
   you to the MSS Server's interface for setting and changing access.

Adding a New Collection

  Preliminaries

     * First you need to get authorization to add files to the Image
       Library system. If you are a member of LBNL, send e-mail to
       MRThompson@lbl.gov or call me at x7408 to arrange access.
     * If the image files are on the Mass Storage System you will need to
       set up the directories they are in for exporting via the MSS Web
       server. Before you can export files from a MSS subtree you need to
       authorize it with the MSS administrator, HHHolmes@lbl.gov. You can
       change access or add new subdirectories via a Web interface to the
       MSS server. See the section on Access Control for more details.
     * Before you add MSS images to your collection you should stage them
       from tape to disk, since the addition process will access them all.
          + If you access mass storage via NFS use the stage command to do
            this
          + If you use FTP or Fetch to access mass storage, use the FTP
            "dir" command or the Fetch "view file list" from the Remote
            option to see if the files are on disk or archive. Do a get
            command on all the archive files to stage them to disk. Once
            they are all on disk exit from FTP or Fetch.

  Instructions

     * Read the previous section, Collection Description, and decide what
       the values for your collection are.
     * Go to the Create a new collection choice from the Curators
       Interface page
     * Fill in the blanks on the Create collection page.
          + Embedded "/"s in collection names are used to create
            sub-collections. Sub-collections can inherit default tags
            files from their parent collection. Both individual
            sub-collections and all the sub-collections of a single parent
            can be a target of searches. The parent collection must be
            created first and then each sub-collection can be created.
          + The image source directory name should be of the form
            /home/mss/... for files residing on the mass storage system.
            It also needs to be exported from the mass storage system by
            the MSS server. If the image source directory is local, it
            must be readable by the Image Library server.
          + The tags file option Use Parent Form is designed for
            hierarchical collections. If you select this option, the
            initial tag file for the sub-collection will be inherited from
            the parent.
     * When the Create Collection form returns to you, check the displayed
       information for correctness and fill in as many default values as
       possible. If you made any changes check make changes. When all the
       information looks correct and you have no more changes click enter
       records which takes you back to the Add/Edit page.
     * To add images to the collection, type the collection name in the
       Add images box on the Add/Edit page (under Curators Interface) and
       click submit to enter. See the section Adding Images for more
       details. If you are creating a parent collection, you may want to
       skip this step and proceed to create the sub-collections.
     * At your leisure you can edit each of the tag files to tell the
       complete truth about each image. See the section Editing Tag Files
       for more details.
     * When the tags files are complete enough that it will be useful to
       search them, you should create a Glimpse index for the collection.
       The Create Glimpse Index option on the Add/Edit page does this.

Adding Images

   The Add images choice from the Add/Edit page takes you to a form that
   gives you a list of all the files in the image source directory. You
   can edit the list to remove any non-image files or images that you do
   not want included in the collection. Entering an image causes a default
   tag file and a pointer to the original high resolution image to be
   entered and then starts a program that will generate the derived
   images. The creation of the derived images take about 1 minute per 4M
   image. After a appropriate interval you can try browsing your new
   collection. The icons with "?" should get replaced with pictures when
   the derived images are in place. If you add images for another
   collection, the images will be queued behind any images that have not
   yet been processed. You can queue images for addition much faster than
   the system can process them, so don't expect instant results.

   Note that the only time the image source directory name is used is when
   images are added. Each entry contains a pointer back to its original
   image. This has two implications; one is that if you move the original
   images this link will be broken. It can be repaired by re-entering the
   image with its new location specified by the image source directory. If
   a tag file exists when an image is entered it will not be touched. The
   second implication is that you can change the image source directory
   before entering a new batch of images and thus have a collection
   consist of images whose originals are in a variety of directories.

   If something appears to have gone wrong while creating the derived
   images, you can open the log file imglog in
   /ImgLib/COLLECTIONS/<YOURCOLL>/images/imglog to see what happened. The
   most likely problem is that the Image Library Server does not have
   access to read some of your image files or that it cannot handle the
   image type. Currently it knows about gif,tiff, jpeg, eps, and some
   DICOM format files. It can handle Macintosh binary versions of all
   these file types except DICOM. The server does check that it has read
   permission to the image source directory before returning in the first
   place.

Eporting Images from the Mass Storage System

   If your orginal images are stored on the Lab's Mass Storage System
   (MSS) and you want to use ImgLib to retrieve these images you must
   export the MSS directories that the files are in. This additional step
   is required to help safe-guard files on the MSS from inadvertly being
   accessible via the Web. Only a user who has write access to an MSS
   directory may export it via ImgLib. This step is independent of the
   steps you take to make the images on MSS readable by the ImgLib server.
   This tells the ImgLib server that it is ok to pass these images off to
   other users whom the collection curator has authorized.

   The Exporting file from Mass Storage System choice on the curator's
   page takes you to a form that allows you to enable a MSS directory for
   exporting and to specify what ImgLib users will be able to get copies
   of the files off of the MSS. The name of the directory to be exported
   is the complete pathname of a MSS directory (eg. /home/mss/icsd/mrt).
   This is probably totally different from the ImgLib collection name that
   points to these images. The userid and groupid are Unix ids that have
   write access to the MSS directory. The Server will run as those ids
   when it is copying files from the MSS to limit the number of
   directories it has access to. The userid may be set to "anyuser" if
   only the groupid is needed to permit write access. Alternatively, you
   can set groupid to "anygroup" if your ImgLib userid matches a Unix
   userid that has write permission in the MSS directory.

   The second part of this form allows you to specify groups and users who
   will have access to the MSS files. The user names and ids should match
   any that you have assigned to the ImgLib collection that points to
   these original files, otherwise you will confuse the users who is asked
   to authenticate twice when fetching MSS files. The reason for the two
   identical sets of users and passwords is to protect the MSS files by
   having a dedicated Web server that interfaces between Web clients and
   the MSS.

Editing Collection information

   The Edit the input form choice from the Add/Edit page takes you to a
   form that allows the collection description, access permissions and
   default tags to be edited. Any changes to the default tags file or to
   the image source directory will affect any new images added to the
   collection but not existing ones. Changes in access control affect the
   existing files as well.

   There is a link to the Add user/group form from the Curators Interface
   page.

   The Create a Glimpse index choice on the Add/Edit page recreates the
   Glimpse index for the specified collection.

Editing Tag Files

   The option Modify a single record ... add, edit, delete record on the
   Add/Edit page lets you add or modify individual text files. This
   individual edit form can also be reached from the display tag and image
   page accessed from the collection browse pages.

Helpful Hints

     * If you get any errors when filling out a form, using the back
       button on the browser will take you back to the previously filled
       in page to correct. Using the back arrows on the error report takes
       you back to a clean form.
     * Any of the directories or files of your collection can be viewed
       directly by using the open function on your browser. Start with the
       URL http://imglib.lbl.gov/ImgLib/COLLECTIONS and append your
       collection name in all capital letters. e.g opening
       http://imglib.lbl.gov/ImgLib/COLLECTIONS/MISC/APOLLO/forms/ will
       display a list of the files that store information about the
       misc/apollo collection.
     * The standard browse option uses a table format designed for viewing
       by Netscape. If you are using a different browser use the
       image_browse option instead and then click on the individual images
       to find out more information about them.
     * Most of the "pages" that are displayed are generated dynamically by
       scripts, thus you do not want to save bookmarks to these pages.
       They can be referenced via your window history list ("Go" menu on
       Netscape) because those pages are cached on your machine. If you
       want to see changes that have been made to a collection since you
       first displayed the page you may need to reload the page using the
       reload button. If you try to open the URL, it will be missing the
       arguments to the script that tells it what information to display
       Dynamic pages can be distinguished from static ones by the file
       name given in the URL. Dynamic pages start with the name /cgi-bin
       where static pages start with /ImgLib and end in .html.

   Each image in the Image Library has some textual information associated
   with it that can be indexed and searched over. When creating a
   collection the owner should decide on a consistent form for the
   information about each image. This template is stored as the default
   tag form. It is used as the template for the tag file which is created
   when an image is added to the collection
