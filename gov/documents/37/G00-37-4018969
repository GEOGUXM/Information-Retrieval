      X-38 airlaunch proves systems

      By Leslie A. Williams
      Public Affairs Specialist

      An advanced X-38 prototype International Space Station "lifeboat"
      floated to a successful touchdown July 10 at Dryden under the world's
      largest parafoil. This is the seventh free flight test for the X-38
      project, ultimately intended to produce a vehicle capable of evacuating
      a seven-person crew from the station in an emergency.

      The landing test, begun at an altitude of about 37,500 feet when the
      X-38 was released from NASA's B-52 aircraft, verified recent
      enhancements made to the X-38's flight control software. The flight
      also checked advances in the two-stage repositioning deployment of a
      drogue parachute that initially slows the vehicle from 600 miles an
      hour to about 60 miles an hour and sets the stage for deployment of the
      7,500-square-foot-parafoil wing. The surface area of the parafoil is
      more than one and a half times that of the wings of a 747 jumbo jet.

      Program engineers continued testing European Space Agency-developed
      software that guides the parafoil, steering the X-38 to a safe landing.
      After a 13-minute gliding descent, the uncrewed X-38 touched down at a
      speed of less than 40 miles an hour on the clay surface of Rogers Dry
      Lake. Several parafoil maneuvers were performed using the
      European-developed X-38 software.

      "Each flight test of the X-38 incorporates technologies that have never
      before been used on a human spacecraft - from satellite-based
      navigation to electromechanical actuators to the giant parafoil," said
      X-38 Crew Return Vehicle Program Manager John Muratore. "Every flight
      gives us invaluable insight into the performance of these technologies
      during an actual descent and brings us closer to proving them for use
      in space."

      The test was the second X-38 mission using the giant parafoil. The test
      also was the second flight of an X-38 shape that includes a
      semicircular cross section aft end, identical to the shape of an X-38
      space vehicle planned for a test flight from a Space Shuttle in 2003
      and now under construction.

      The European-influenced semicircular aft end could allow the X-38 to be
      compatible with launch on a European Ariane V rocket as well as aboard
      the Space Shuttle.

      The X-38 project is developing technologies that could be used to
      operate a prototype "lifeboat" for the International Space Station. The
      project combines proven technology - a shape borrowed from a 1970s Air
      Force project - with some of the most cutting-edge aerospace technology
      available today.

      Although the United States has led the development of the X-38,
      international space agencies also are participating. Contributing
      countries include Germany, Belgium, Italy, The Netherlands, France,
      Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.

      NASA's Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, leads the X-38 program and
      is building the space-rated test vehicles. The X-38 atmospheric test
      vehicles were built by Scaled Composites, Mojave, Calif. Dryden flight
      tests the evolving X-38s.
