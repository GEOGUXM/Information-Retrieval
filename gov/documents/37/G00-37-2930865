   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Congressmen Marty Meehan and John Tierney
   today announced $2.9 million in federal assistance from the U.S.
   Department of Labor to help dislocated workers at Lucent Technologies.

   These funds, under the National Emergency Grant Program, will provide
   services including career counseling, job placement and job training
   for the 800 workers dislocated as a result of the recent scaleback at
   Lucent Technologies in North Andover, Massachusetts.

   "This is an important commitment to helping the workforce in the
   Merrimack Valley," Senator Kennedy said. "These 800 men and women have
   worked hard to build the economy in this region, and we need to stand
   by them now during these difficult economic times."

   "Layoffs at Lucent are taking a personal and economic toll on the
   Merrimack Valley," said Congressman Meehan. "We owe Lucent workers who
   want to work again the training and assistance required for
   re-employment. This funding will help laid off workers find their way
   back to the workforce and is one component of what we must do to
   enhance economic security for Lucent employees."

   Congressman Tierney said, "We are pleased that the Department has
   worked with us, Senator Kennedy, and Congressman Meehan and has
   recognized the serious needs of Lucent employees in the wake of the
   announced closure of the North Andover plant. This emergency grant will
   provide much needed counseling and training assistance to those workers
   who made the company successful for so long as they prepare for new
   employment."
