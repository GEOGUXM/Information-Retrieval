   Capabilities

      The combination of experienced staff, resources, and technologies,
      together with linkages to staff in other disciplines at PNNL, gives the
      Hydrology Group the following capabilities to solve client needs:
        * Rivers - predict the complex in-stream interactions of physical and
          biological processes in rivers and streams to assess impacts on
          water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Point of Contact: Marshall
          Richmond
        * Watersheds - assess and predict the impacts of climate change,
          hydropower, and irrigation on watershed health. Point of Contact:
          Mark Wigmosta
        * Recharge - measure and predict water fluxes to groundwater in
          natural systems and through surface barriers over waste sites.
          Point of Contact: Glendon Gee
        * Vadose Zone - measure, understand, and predict the properties of
          the vadose zone, and the flow of water and the fate and transport
          of contaminants through the vadose zone. Point of Contact: Glendon
          Gee
        * Multiphase Flow - measure and predict the behavior of multiphase
          contaminants in porous media. Point of Contact: Martinus Oostrom
        * Groundwater Modeling - predict groundwater movement and contaminant
          fate and transport. Point of Contact: Marcel Bergeron
        * Water Resource Management - monitor, model, and assess water
          resources across multiple entities: watersheds, lakes, rivers,
          estuaries, soil water, groundwater. Point of Contact: Lance Vail
        * Performance and Risk Assessment - predict the risks of
          environmental contamination or the performance of a disposal
          facility or remediation scheme. Point of Contacts: Charles Kincaid
          Gene Whelan
