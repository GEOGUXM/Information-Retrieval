   Projects: [Select a Project________________________]

   Project Name Target Chemical:

                                Alternatives

                              Programs Affected

                                   Status
   Current Process:
   Material Applications:

   Non Chromate  Primer

   Target Hazardous Waste:
   Chromium

   The Dexter product from the JG-PP B-A&M Nonchromate Primers Project was
   chosen to flight test on the Orbiter Columbia

   Orbiter is testing primer to date.  Seeking to migrate non-chrome
   alternatives to other programs such as External Tank, Space Station,
   Ground Support Equipment and other facility processes.
