PFEL OCEANOGRAPHIC AND ATMOSPHERIC PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

   An important aspect of the work at PFEL is the development of new
   techniques and data products which will assist in describing the
   variability in the ocean environment. PFEL scientists also are actively
   involved in quality control of these data and products, and conduct
   ongoing research to understand how the data can be used to describe the
   ocean environment, and linkages between environmental variability and
   fluctuations in the abundance and distribution of marine populations.
