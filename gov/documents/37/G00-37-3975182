                         Habitat Digitizer Extension

   The Habitat Digitizer Extension to ArcView 3.1 was designed to use a
   hierarchical classification scheme to delineate habitats by visually
   interpreting georeferenced images such as aerial photographs, satellite
   images, and side scan sonar. The extension allows users to create
   custom classification schemes and rapidly delineate and attribute
   polygons using simple menus. Originally, the extension was created to
   classify tropical marine habitats. However, the extension now allows
   new hierarchical classification schemes to be easily created, modified,
   and saved for use on future mapping projects. There are several
   advantages to using classification schemes with a hierarchical
   structure including: the detail of habitat categories can be expanded
   or collapsed to suit user needs, the thematic accuracy of each
   category/hierarchical level can be determined, and additional
   categories can be easily added or deleted at any level of the scheme to
   suit user needs. The classification scheme included with this extension
   (coral.hcs) was used to create the habitat shapefiles for the "Benthic
   Habitats of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands".
