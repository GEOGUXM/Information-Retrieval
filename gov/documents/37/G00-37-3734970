   In 7,000 years of agriculture, civilizations have encountered their
   greatest problems as a result of the erosion and siltation caused by
   trying to establish permanent agriculture on sloping lands.



   This image refreshes annually.  The field in the picture shows a
   typical crop rotation of corn and soybeans on a gently sloping
   hillside.
   The use of conservation tillage alone is not adequate to prevent crop
   losses from erosion (yellow area left side) and the resulting
   sedimentation.
   The use of grass buffers and waterways, or terraces is vital for the
   protection of the soil resource on this Minnesota farm.
