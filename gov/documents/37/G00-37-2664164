   A Welcome from Jim Nicholas, Michigan District Chief

   These web pages are designed for youâ€”people who enjoy recreational
   activities on water, people who care about the condition of our water
   resources, people who drink or otherwise use water, and people who
   manage or regulate water resources. Most of the information in these
   web pages is about Michigan District activities, however we also
   provide you with many, many links to other water-resource sites and
   other USGS sites.
   I hope that you find the information on these web pages to be helpful,
   interesting, and informative. If you have any comments or suggestions
   on how the pages could be improved to better serve your needs, please
   contact the Michigan District Webmaster. These pages are updated on a
   regular basis, so we trust you will come back often to see what we have
   to offer.
