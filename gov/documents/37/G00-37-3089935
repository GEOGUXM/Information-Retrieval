   Bens Guide has also been reviewed in various publications. Heres what
   theyre saying:
     * The Washington Lawyer (October, 2000) wrote, "Of all the
       educational resources on the World Wide Web, this is one of the
       best for teaching young people about such things as historical
       documents, branches of government, how laws are made, the election
       process, and much more."

     * The Philadelphia Inquirer (May 11, 2000) noted that while the
       Federal government "is growing increasingly child-friendly," Ben's
       Guide fills a civics void.  In addition, it recommends that "any
       virtual government tour" start with Ben.

     * The Newsletter of the Documents Interest Group of Oregon (DIGOR)
       called Bens Guide "a well-designed childrens website" that "could
       be useful for reference questions as well" and described it as
       having "an attention to detail and to readability that is exemplary
       in web design."

     * AccessAmerica, an electronic newsletter of the National Partnership
       for Re-Inventing Government, highlights Bens Guide, calling it
       "exciting" and a "powerful resource."
