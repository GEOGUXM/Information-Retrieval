   Strikes Loom at Manchester Airport

   Manchester Airport (MAN). The Transport and General Workers Union (T&G)
   said they will hold a series of one-hour strikes in protest at plans to
   cut 140 security jobs. BBC News reports the first one-hour stoppage
   will take place on Monday, 04-Feb-2002. The 60-minute stoppages will
   take place between 0600 and 0700 GMT on February 4, 7, 9, 11, and 16.
   There will be a two-hour stoppage between 1200 and 1400 GMT on
   Thursday, 14-Feb-2002. The union says the strikes will continue every
   Monday, Thursday and Saturday thereafter, until the company alters its
   plans. There has been increasing friction between the two sides since
   an internal airport business review was leaked to the union in
   Oct-2001. Workers involved in the strike action include firemen,
   security guards, airfield marshallers, engineers and clerical staff.
   Airport management has asked the union to cancel the strike plans while
   further talks take place, and assures the public that stringent
   government security standards would be upheld at all times. When
   traveling via Manchester during the next month, try to avoid the times
   when the stoppages are scheduled .
