   Hydrological and hydrogeological reports pertaining to North Carolina
   come in a variety of formats. Most are in a single book form, but some
   are published as map reports, booklets, brochures, abstracts, fact
   sheets, or as chapters or sections in larger books or reports; some are
   contained in scientific journals. Not all USGS publications pertaining
   to North Carolina are available. Some older reports may be out of print
   and some are available only in libraries.

   Cooperative support for most of the water-resources data and
   investigative reports is furnished by the North Carolina Department of
   Environment and Natural Resources and its predecessor agencies; the
   North Carolina Department of Transportation; other State agencies; and
   many county and city governments. A number of other Federal agencies
   cooperatively supported some of the investigations.
