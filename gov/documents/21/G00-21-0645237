                Mission of the National Soil Tilth Laboratory

   The mission of the National Soil Tilth Laboratory is to generate and
   integrate knowledge for the development and evaluation of management
   practices that enhance surface and ground water quality while ensuring
   the long term enhancement and conservation of the nation's soil and
   water resources. Multidisciplinary research teams conduct quantitative
   research on soil biological, chemical, and physical processes and their
   interaction as related to agricultural practices. Research findings
   will improve the understanding of the impact of current agricultural
   practices on the soil and water resources and evaluate the effect of
   changing practices on soil and water quality at the field, watershed,
   and regional scale.

   This mission is directed toward two primary goals. First, development
   and evaluation of farming practices and landscape management practices
   that will improve water and soil quality in the Midwest. Second,
   development and evaluation of a framework for assessing soil quality
   relative to soil function (plant productivity, environmental buffer,
   and water movement in the environment).
