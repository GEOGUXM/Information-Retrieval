                        MODEL PERFORMANCE STATISTICS

   The Environmental Modeling Center continuously monitors its NWP model
   performance against different performance measures, and against its
   'competition' from other global forecast centers.  The following web
   links offer graphics of these performance measures at various time and
   space dimensions.  Click on the following links to get to the correct
   model list:


                                AVN/MRF

                                Eta

   AVN/MRF:

       performance


       Experimental meteograms for surface and near surface forecast
       parameters, and verifications of forecast against observations over
       the U.S.

      Pete Caplan's RMS errors and anomaly correlation statistics
   (verification against  analyses) for AVN/MRF compared to ECWMF, Navy
   NOGAPS, UKMET

       Includes scores for extratropics  (500 hPa heights) and tropics
       (200 hPa and 850 hPa u-v and vector wind), day 5 scores, daily
       scores, error growth rates, anomaly correlations (with breakdown by
       size of wave), and other graphics.

     *  Suru Saha's experimental web page  (AVN verified against RAOBS)

     * Time series of AVN fit to RAOBS

     * AVN SSI and forecast fits to RAOBS  for last 7 days

     * spatial bias maps for different regions
     * vertical profile bias maps aerially averaged for different regions

     AVN SSI and forecast fits to RAOBS  for calendar months (time series,
   spatial and vertical bias maps)
     * AVN SSI data distribution plots (shows gaps in the initial analysis
       which may affect model forecast performance)
     * AVN SSI data dump counts (how much data was included from each type
       used in the SSI analysis)  Few or no points may indicate potential
       problems with model forecast performance.  The type of problems may
       be anticipated from the type of data excluded.
