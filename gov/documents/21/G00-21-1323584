   Experimental Galveston Bay/Houston Ship Channel
   Nowcasting/Forecasting System

   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration installed a
   Physical Oceanographic Real Time System (PORTS) in June 1996 to monitor
   Galveston Bay. Water surface elevation, currents at prediction depth
   (4.6m), temperature, salinity, and meteorological information are
   available at six-minute intervals. To complement the PORTS, a
   nowcast/forecast system is being developed based on the National Ocean
   Service (NOS) Galveston Bay three-dimensional hydrodynamic model. To
   simulate currents within the Houston Ship Channel (HSC), a finer
   resolution three-dimensional HSC model has been developed. The
   Galveston Bay model is used to provide bay-wide water level and near
   entrance current forecasts as well as to directly provide water levels,
   density, and turbulence quantities to the HSC model for use in a
   one-way coupling. Each day an experimental 24 hour nowcast and 36 hour
   forecast of water level, currents, salinity, and temperature is
   performed. Experimental nowcasts and forecasts are made with both the
   Bay and HSC models driven by: 1) observed (PORTS) and forecasted (NWS
   Extra-Tropical Storm Surge model) subtidal water level at Galveston
   Pleasure Pier, 2) observed streamflow (USGS) and forecasted streamflow
   (NWS Western Gulf River Forecast Center), and 3) analyzed (PORTS
   meteorological stations) and forecast (NWS Aviation model) wind and
   pressure fields.
