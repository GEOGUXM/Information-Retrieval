             About The Director, Ms. Janyce N. Hedetniemi, M.S.

   Ms. Janyce Hedetniemi was named Director of the newly created NIH
   Office of Community Liaison in September, 1994. In announcing her
   appointment, Dr. Harold Varmus, Director, NIH, said that "Ms.
   Hedetniemi brings to her position a long history of experience and
   involvement with advocates and community groups". Prior to assuming
   responsibility for community liaison, Ms. Hedetniemi had coordinated
   the development of Secretary Shalala's National Action Plan on Breast
   Cancer. In this capacity, Ms. Hedetniemi convened a December 1994
   conference that brought together advocates, patients, physicians,
   researchers, and industry and education leaders to fashion a national
   effort on the eradication of breast cancer. Ms. Hedetniemi has been at
   the NIH since 1977, serving three Institutes in progressively
   responsible positions in planning, evaluation, and analysis. Among her
   positions prior to coming to the NIH was that of Special Assistant to
   the Chairman of the D.C. City Council. In that capacity, Ms. Hedetniemi
   worked with COG, the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, the
   Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority Board of Directors, and the
   National Capital Planning Commission. She also has been involved in the
   academic world and was Director of Development for Mount Vernon College
   and Assistant Dean of Women at the University of Maryland.

   Ms. Hedetniemi holds a Bachelor's degree from Carnegie Mellon
   University and a Master's degree from Indiana University.
