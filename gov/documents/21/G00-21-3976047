   (E-mail) January 10, 2001 CERTIFICATE AS TO PARTIES, RULINGS, AND
   RELATED CASES To the best of amicus' knowledge, all information on
   these topics is the same as that provided by Microsoft in its Brief for
   Defendant-Appellant. Any corrections thereto will presumably be made by
   the Plaintiffs-Appellees. CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE This brief complies
   with all style and length requirements, being set in 12-point type,
   with all margins at least one inch, and with those sections of its
   content requiring page numbers not exceeding 25 pages total, and is
   being filed in both ".pdf" and paper format. DISCLOSURE STATEMENT The
   amicus, Carl Lundgren, is an individual who is filing pro se without
   the use of an expensive attorney. The amicus would have preferred to
   file as the business, Valmarpro Antitrust, but was barred by the
   Court's rules from doing so without an attorney. Valmarpro Antitrust is

   Association for Competitive Technology. A trade association of
   Microsoft-friendly companies primarily funded by Microsoft. "DOJ"
   Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. Currently
   representing the United States of America as the primary Plaintiff in
   this case (along with nineteen states). "FTC" Federal Trade Commission.
   An independent federal agency dedicated (along with DOJ) to enforcement
   of the antitrust laws. Not currently a party to this case.
   "Netscape/Java" Two programming languages which Plaintiffs hypothesize
   could have displaced Microsoft's dominant status in the computer
   software world. Both Netscape and Java, either jointly or
   independently, could have acted as "middleware" for applications
   programs that would have allowed such applications programs to run on
   any computer operating system. If successful, the Netscape/Java
   programs would have considerably reduced the profitability of the
   Microsoft-brand "Windows" computer operating systems. "Oligopoly" An
   industry or market structure in which only a few firms produce or sell
   most of the output. As distinguished from "monopoly" where only one
   firm produces most of the output. If Microsoft is divided into two
   firms, with each being assigned to separate lines of business, this
   turns one monopoly into two monopolies. If Microsoft is divided into
   two or three firms, with each firm being assigned to the same lines of
   business, this creates an oligopoly market structure. "OMB" Office of
   Management and Budget. A federal government agency within the Executive
   Office of the President. Among other duties, OMB reviews all
   "significant regulatory actions". "RPM" Relative Profit Maximizing. A
   set of incentives, either for firms or for managers of firms, such that
   firms are induced to maximize their profits relative to the profits of
   competing firms, rather than simply maximize profits in absolute terms
   (measured without reference to other firms). Intended as a method for
   preventing collusion (including "tacit collusion") and other
   imperfectly competitive oligopoly interactions between firms. vii
   "zero-sum game" A game or real-life situation in which the pay-offs for
   two or more players sums to some constant (not necessarily zero). In a
   zero- sum game, the pay-offs or incentives are such that if one player
   gains, another player must lose. Hence, there is no incentive for all
   players in a zero-sum game to cooperate (or "collude") because it is
   not possible for all players to benefit from such an agreement. An
   example of a zero-sum game is dividing a pie of fixed size. viii
   INTRODUCTION AND INTEREST OF THE AMICUS CURIAE Carl Lundgren is the
   author and inventor of a new economic method for preventing collusion.
   This economic method is described in an article published in a refereed
   academic journal.1 It is also the subject of a pending patent
   application. If Microsoft is split into two or more parts, this
   economic invention has possible application to Microsoft. It is not the
   purpose of this amicus brief to prove to the Appeals Court the merits
   of this economic invention. Instead, this brief is dedicated to arguing
   that the District Court needed to test the government's proposed
   remedy, both for sensibleness and for adequacy, and needed to consider
   alternative remedies. For this purpose, the District Court needed to
   establish remedy proceedings and needed to admit third parties to such
   remedy proceedings. This brief will not argue for or against the
   District Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law. Rather, where
   needed, this brief will simply assume the truth of such facts and
   conclusions for purposes of fashioning a remedy. Naturally, if
   Microsoft's conviction is overturned, in whole or in part, the remedy
   may need to be scaled back or eliminated entirely. BACKGROUND Microsoft
   has been convicted of illegally maintaining a monopoly in computer
   operating systems and illegally acquiring a monopoly in Internet
   browsers. These are serious antitrust violations. The government
   plaintiffs proposed what appeared to be an equally serious remedy:
   Divide Microsoft into two companies. 1Carl Lundgren, "Using Relative
   Profit Incentives to Prevent Collusion," Review of Industrial
   Organization, Vol. 11, No. 4, August 1996, pp. 533-550. 1 However, as
   serious as this remedy may appear, it is not obviously a good remedy,
   nor is it obviously an adequate remedy. The remedy selected by the
   government plaintiffs would simply split one monopoly into two
   monopolies, and then hope that the two monopolies decide to compete
   with each other. As a treatment for monopoly power, it is suspiciously
   inadequate. The government has not shown, either by way of public
   hearings and published regulatory analysis, or by way of evidence
   presented to the District Court, that this two-monopolies remedy is in
   the public interest. The need and expectation for remedy proceedings,
   to ascertain the best remedy, seems to have been held by most of the
   parties and amici. One may speculate on why the District Court did not
   hold remedy hearings of any substance. One hypothesis is that the
   District Court was uncertain whether its findings and conclusions
   (which Microsoft vociferously objected to) would be upheld on appeal.
   Rather than spend time immediately on remedy hearings, the District
   Court may have reasoned that it was better to find out what findings
   and conclusions would survive appeal, and then spend time later to
   fashion the most appropriate remedy. As plausible as this hypothesis
   may be, it does not fully square with the District Court's words, which
   proclaimed itself to be incompetent in economic matters, and which
   claimed that testimony concerning future events is virtually useless,
   thereby implying that no remedy hearings of any substance would ever be
   provided. ARGUMENT I. Need for, and Procedural Requirements for, a
   Substantive Remedies Procedure That Considers All Reasonable Remedy
   Alternatives A. Multiple Remedies Are Possible Possible remedies for
   Microsoft have been much discussed in the press, and in various 2
   formal submissions to the District Court. Press accounts include an
   article in Business Week, which briefly discusses pros and cons of
   numerous options.2 Filings with the District Court include the amicus
   brief filed by Robert Litan, on behalf of himself and three other
   economists.3 The Litan Brief discusses in some detail a multitude of
   options, before setting forth their own preferred remedy, which
   includes dividing Microsoft into two companies along the lines
   suggested by Plaintiffs, and then further sub-dividing the operating
   system company into three competing parts. These two references alone
   suggest a multiplicity of possible remedies for Microsoft, which will
   require more than two parties to elucidate fully. B. Ascertaining the
   Public Interest Requires Evidentiary Submissions from Third Parties;
   DOJ Is Not the Only Doctor of Economics The public interest is like a
   patient who cannot speak for himself. Imagine a patient who is a child,
   comatose, senile, or insane. Suppose further that the patient clearly
   needs medical treatment, but the patient's Guardian (defendant) is
   adamantly opposed to medical treatment of any kind. Doctor A (the
   plaintiff) petitions the Court to order treatment. However, the
   patient's condition is complex, and different treatments are possible.
   Doctors B, C, and D petition the Court to intervene as additional
   parties, in order to explain alternative treatments. If the Court is
   truly concerned with the welfare of the patient, the Court will admit
   Doctors B, C, and D as additional parties. Such additional parties
   would have full authority to present their own evidence and testimony,
   not simply amicus briefs. 2Mike France, et al, "Does a Breakup Make
   Sense?" Business Week, November 22, 1999, pp. 38-41 3The four
   economists on the Litan Brief were: Robert E. Litan, Roger G. Noll,
   William D. Nordhaus, and Frederic Scherer. 3 To do otherwise would mean
   limiting the evidence solely to the medical views of Doctor A and the
   nonmedical views of the Guardian. This would effectively exclude the
   medical views of Doctors B, C, and D, even if their medical treatments
   would be better. In this analogy, Doctor A is the Department of Justice
   ("DOJ"), and Microsoft is the Guardian. The Guardian was supposed to
   further the public interest, by pursuing a profit within the confines
   of the law. However, the Guardian now stands convicted of ignoring and
   violating the antitrust laws, and thereby harming the public interest.
   The Plaintiff offers economic treatment (Split the Guardian in two!),
   which the Court adopts. However, the Court does not seriously consider
   the opinions of additional Doctors of Economics, nor does it permit the
   advocates of alternative economic treatments to intervene as additional
   parties to present their own evidence and testimony. Clearly, under
   these circumstances the public interest must suffer, just as the
   patient's interests would suffer in the analogous example. C. The
   Public Interest Is an Amalgamation of Multiple Private Interests; DOJ
   Has No Monopoly on Wisdom Concerning the Public Interest Unlike the
   patient, the public is composed of many persons, each of whom has
   different goals, opportunities, and interests. For purposes of
   analytical convenience, it is useful to divide and group the public
   into several categories, depending on the similarity or distinctiveness
   of their respective interests. Ascertaining the public interest
   requires an assessment of the costs and benefits of each remedy
   proposal to each distinctive group, as well as a consideration of the
   equity of the distribution of those costs and benefits. This
   undertaking is sufficiently complex, that Congress does not entrust the
   DOJ to complete this task successfully without public input. Such
   public input is necessary for two reasons. First, the DOJ may not have
   adequate information concerning the impacts of a 4 proposed remedy upon
   particular types of consumers or producers. Second, the DOJ in its
   economic analysis may be operating from limited perspectives, or other
   biases. Hence, with respect to every proposed consent decree in
   antitrust cases, the DOJ is required to publish a "competitive impact
   statement", and to provide a sixty-day window in which the public can
   present comments. 15 U.S.C. § 16(b,d). The DOJ is then obligated to
   respond, in writing, to all significant comments. 15 U.S.C. § 16(b,d).
   This competitive impact statement, the public comments, and the DOJ's
   responses are presented to the District Judge for review, before a
   consent decree can be approved. 15 U.S.C. § 16(b,d,e,f). If the
   Plaintiffs had undertaken a consent decree with Microsoft, all third
   parties would have the right to present comments (including evidence
   and affidavits), and would have the right to expect a written response
   to their comments from the DOJ, as well as a review of their comments
   by the District Court. This would include members of the public who may
   have a direct or indirect financial stake, as well as interested
   individuals with expertise who have no significant financial stake. In
   a trial on the merits, we would expect all third parties to have the
   same or superior rights.4 For the District Court arbitrarily to
   disregard the rights of any third party to comment upon or influence
   the course of remedy is a serious abuse of discretion, which contracts
   the public's rights and impedes a determination of the public interest.
   D. If DOJ Is the Regulator, Then DOJ Should Comply with Executive Order
   12866--Regulatory Planning and Review 4A similar point was made by
   Microsoft's ally, ACT: "Accordingly, ACT respectfully suggests that the
   Court establish an orderly mechanism by which it and other affected
   members of the public can submit further comments and evidence on the
   likely impacts of the plaintiffs's proposals." (ACT Proposal, end of §
   I) 5 According to the District Court's reasoning, remedy hearings are
   both useless and unnecessary. Useless, because the Court has no
   economic expertise. Unnecessary, because the DOJ (supposedly) has all
   those top-notch economists at its disposal. The District Court sends up
   a white flag: DOJ has all those economists, the Court has none, so let
   the DOJ be the de facto regulator of Microsoft. Since the District
   Court is still the de jure regulator, the Court's only further
   contribution is to rubber-stamp the DOJ remedy proposal. This places
   the DOJ into a regulatory dilemma. If the DOJ is the de facto regulator
   of Microsoft, the DOJ might as well be the de jure regulator of
   Microsoft. If so, then the DOJ is potentially subject to Executive
   Order 12866. Among other things, this Order identifies twelve
   principles of regulation, including: (3) Each agency shall identify and
   assess available alternatives to direct regulation, including providing
   economic incentives to encourage the desired behavior,... (5) ... [an
   agency] shall design its regulations in the most cost-effective manner
   to achieve the regulatory objective.... (6) Each agency shall assess
   both the costs and the benefits of the intended regulation and,...
   propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that
   the benefits of the intended regulation justify its costs. (8) Each
   agency shall identify and assess alternative forms of regulation...
   (11) Each agency shall tailor its regulations to impose the least
   burden on society, including individuals, businesses of differing
   sizes, and other entities ... consistent with obtaining the regulatory
   objectives,...5 If the DOJ were subject to this Order, the regulation
   of Microsoft would clearly be a "significant regulatory action", since
   it has an annual effect on the economy of more than $100 million. In
   addition, the DOJ would be obligated to "provide the public with
   meaningful participation in the regulatory process." The DOJ did none
   of this. There is no 5The President, "Executive Order 12866 of
   September 30, 1993--Regulatory Planning and Review," Federal Register ,

   regulatory analysis of the costs and benefits of the proposed
   regulation of Microsoft, nor is there any published economic analysis
   of the various regulatory alternatives. Moreover, the whole process of
   selecting a remedy for Microsoft was performed in secret; the public
   was provided no meaningful participation. E. If the District Court Is
   the Regulator, Then the Court must Implement Sensible Evidentiary
   Procedures to Ensure That Best and Lawful Remedies Are Selected The
   District Court remains the de jure regulator who must approve any
   remedy imposed on Microsoft. Even when faced with a consent decree, the
   antitrust Court has no authority to act like a rubber stamp.6 In the
   absence of any public record of remedy hearings, whether by the DOJ or
   by the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), which the Court can rely upon
   and possibly supplement, the Court cannot credibly evade its own
   responsibility to select a best remedy. This means that the Court must
   set up sensible procedures which test the government's proposed remedy,
   and which consider and weigh various alternative remedies. The Court
   must develop a public record on its own initiative. As Dr. Litan
   argued: We begin by underscoring the need for a careful and independent
   judicial inquiry into the nature of the appropriate remedy. Indeed, as
   the Supreme Court has highlighted, the development of an appropriate
   remedy is "the most significant phase of the [antitrust] case ." United
   States v. Glaxo Group Ltd., 410 U.S. 52, 64 (1973) (emphasis added).

   review of the relevant literature indicates that the relief phase of
   antitrust cases is often treated as an afterthought, even in cases as
   important as monopolization findings under Section 2 of the Sherman
   Act. For example, Professor Lawrence Sullivan has observed: "Perhaps
   the best hope is that, hereafter, Courts facing structural remedy
   issues will get more help than they have customarily received from the
   Department of Justice. As Judge Wyzanski implied in United Shoe
   Machinery, the government is sometimes extremely casual about remedy."7
   A similar point of view has been voiced by Chief Judge Richard Posner
   (who attempted to mediate a settlement in this case): "Another reason
   for the poor record of divestiture as an antitrust remedy is that the
   government's lawyers tend to lose interest in a case at the relief
   stage. They derive both personal satisfaction and career advancement
   from the trial of an antitrust case, but gain neither from the
   post-trial relief negotiations and proceedings, which they frequently
   tend to pay scant attention."8 (Litan Brief, p. 11) * * * * * * * * * *
   * The Court should recognize that it has broad discretion to fashion
   relief. It is the Court's job to accomplish the objectives set out by
   the Supreme Court for addressing the ill effects of monopolization.
   This simple statement leads to a critical conclusion, however: the
   remedy should not be limited to the relief that the government
   plaintiffs may propose. The Court's role in fashioning a remedy for
   proven antitrust violations is analogous to but much more extensive
   than its much more limited role in reviewing proposed antitrust consent
   decrees.9 In particular, if the Court finds that the proposed remedies
   will not attain the fundamental principles underlying the need for
   relief, the Court should not be deterred from imposing a different
   remedy than any the government plaintiffs may offer. (Litan Brief, p.
   12) The Court has ample authority under 28 U.S.C. § 24(a,b) to admit
   new parties and amicus briefs as needed to develop the evidence,
   cross-examination, and briefing needed to 7[Litan Brief, note 3]

   Economic Perspective, University of Chicago Press, 1978 [sic, 1976], at
   [88-]89. 9[Litan Brief, note 5] This proceeding differs from that
   arising from the 1994 consent decree that Microsoft entered into with
   the Justice Department. In that matter, the D.C. Circuit held that
   Judge Sporkin exceeded his authority under the Tunney Act, which
   applies only to consent decrees and not to final judgments, because
   Judge Sporkin wanted the government to pursue a broader case than the
   one it actually filed. 8 find the best remedies. Motions for full
   intervention should be granted, where the parties intend to propose
   distinctive remedies which require additional evidence, testimony, or
   cross examination to support. Motions for limited intervention (amicus
   status) should be granted where distinctive perspectives do not require
   additional evidence, perhaps because the supported remedy is similar to
   the remedy proposals of other parties. While the Court cannot directly
   force the DOJ to pay adequate attention to its remedy, the Court can
   indirectly provide incentive by embarrassing the DOJ if it fails to pay
   the required attention. The Court's rules of procedure should balance
   both speed and quality of decision making in the public interest.
   Microsoft does not have a "due process" right to impede the remedy
   hearings; its testimony is relevant only insofar as ascertaining the
   public interest requires assessing the impacts upon Microsoft and
   others. Six months is probably adequate to determine whether and what
   type of divestiture of Microsoft is most appropriate. F. The Discover
   Card Dictum Is Badly Flawed In rejecting both my amicus brief and my
   motion for intervention, the District Court gave no reasons.10 Perhaps
   a sense of possible reasons can be gleaned from a ruling in a different
   District Court, in a different antitrust case. In a recent antitrust
   case involving Visa Card and MasterCard, Discover Card sought
   intervention in the remedies phase of trial to protect both its own
   interests and the public interest. The District Court reuffed
   Discover's motion, saying among other things: 10On April 25, 2000 Carl
   Lundgren filed a "Request to File a Friend of the Court Brief on Behalf
   of Valmarpro Antitrust" along with a "Brief Amicus Curiae of Valmarpro
   Antitrust on Behalf of an Alternative Remedy for Microsoft Based on
   Using Relative Profit Incentives". On May 17, 2000 Carl Lundgren filed
   a "Motion by Valmarpro Antitrust to Intervene as an Independent Third
   Party". 9 While Discover undoubtedly has an interest relating to the
   subject matter of the action, in government antitrust actions, courts
   have uniformly recognized that the government represents the public
   interest in competition, unless a private party makes an extraordinary
   showing to the contrary. See United States v. Bechtel Corp., 648 F.2d
   660, 666 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1083 (1981); United States
   v. Associated Milk Producers, Inc., 394 F.Supp. 29, aff'd, 534 F.2d
   113, 117-18 (8th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. National Farmers'
   Organization, Inc. v. United States , 429 U.S. 940 (1976).11 The
   trouble with this dictum is that it implies too much. Saying that the
   government represents every member of the public is similar to saying
   that a single creditor represents the interests of all creditors in a
   bankruptcy proceeding. Though the government may be obligated to pursue
   the public interest (suitably defined), it does not define the public
   interest, nor is it the only entity which can represent the public
   interest (however fully or partially), nor does an uncorrupt government
   always know and pursue the public interest. Both cases cited in support
   of this overly broad proposition involve consent decrees, not trials on
   the merits. In consent decrees, the government's decisions are entitled
   to more deference (in particular, the agreed-to remedy need not be
   optimal), otherwise neither party would have much incentive to settle
   out of court. Such considerations do not apply to a trial on the
   merits, where the very purpose of the remedy hearing is to ascertain
   the public interest, based on evidence and testimony. Moreover, none of
   the cited cases stands for the proposition that third parties should be
   arbitrarily excluded from remedy hearings. The first case cited
   involves an attempt by Bechtel Corporation to withdraw consent from its
   own consent decree; no issue of third-party intervention is present.
   648 F.2d at 663. The second case cited involves a denial of third-

   intervention, but only based on good causes shown by the Court. 534
   F.2d at 118. Finally, even the Court quoted above did not entirely
   exclude Discover from the proceedings. Discover had supplied witnesses
   to the proceeding, had presumably been consulted by the government, and
   was permitted to file an amicus brief on its preferred remedy. G.
   Testimony Concerning Future Events and Scientific Principles Is
   Possible, and Not Altogether Unreliable The District Court argues
   against the desirability of extended remedy hearings in the following
   terms: Finally, the Court believes that extended proceedings on the
   form a remedy should take are unlikely to give any significantly
   greater assurance that it will be able to identify what might be
   generally regarded as an optimum remedy.... In its experience the Court
   has found testimonial predictions of future events generally less
   reliable even than testimony as to historical fact, and
   cross-examination to be of little use in enhancing or detracting from
   their accuracy. (United States v. Microsoft Corp., 97 F.Supp. 2d 59,
   62, D.D.C. 2000) The District Court is unduly pessimistic about the
   ability of further proceedings to identify optimal remedies. It is not
   relevant that predictions of future events are less accurate than
   testimony concerning past events. What the Court needs in order to
   determine best remedies is not actual predictions of future events, but
   predictions of the form, "Action A will be better or worse than Action
   B, for the following reasons...." For example, specific predictions of
   the actual price of software under monopoly or under competition are
   not needed in order to determine that the price of software will be
   higher under monopoly than under competition. That prices are higher
   under monopoly than under competition is a basic proposition or theorem
   of economics, which admits of relatively few exceptions. It is also the
   basic principle which underlies the antitrust laws. Numerous more
   complicated predictions can be reasoned out using both theoretical and
   empirical economic techniques. 11 H. A Method for Expanding the
   District Court's Economic Expertise The Washington Post quotes Judge
   Jackson as saying: "It's important you understand what my function is
   here. I am not an economist. I do not have the resources of economic
   research or any significant ability to be able to craft a remedy of my
   own devising." ("Reluctant Ruling for Judge," James V. Grimaldi,
   Washington Post, June 8, 2000, p. A01) The Post concluded, "As a
   result, Jackson relied heavily on the work of the government." It is
   not essential that the Court retain this self-imposed limitation on its
   expertise. One way the District Court can expand its economic expertise
   would be to hold remedy hearings before an expert jury of economists,
   who would act as special masters to the Court. Such an expert jury can
   be selected at random from lists of the American Economic Association
   and other sources. The jurors can be paid a reasonable compensation,
   and would be strictly volunteers, who would read any affidavits and
   transcripts in private, then meet for discussions. Each expert juror
   would provide, individually, best recommendations to the Court, and
   would not be required to arrive at a unanimous conclusion. The Court
   could then decide, based on the various recommendations, what type of
   remedy to adopt. Several experts selected at random may be better than
   a single Court Master, particularly if there is lacking any agreement
   on which economists may be impartial. II. Standards for Selecting a
   Best Remedy A. The Remedial Power of the Court Is Immense; Standards
   Are Needed to Prevent the Potential for Abuse The antitrust court has
   remedial power to order many things. Antitrust courts have ordered the
   divestiture of assets, and even the divestiture of whole companies.
   Antitrust courts have ordered the licensing, for free or for a fee set
   by the Court, of intellectual 12 property in the form of patents.
   Antitrust courts have imposed various conduct remedies, both to forbid
   unwanted conduct and to require wanted conduct. The Court has power to
   threaten imprisonment of any corporate officer who refuses its edicts.
   Presumably, the Court has power to replace management personnel, much
   as a Court might take over or put into receivership a recalcitrant or
   corrupt labor union, school, or prison. However, the Court must not act
   in an arbitrary manner; standards of remedy are needed. B. Adequacy of
   the Remedy to Deter or Prevent Future Antitrust Violations, and to
   Limit or Dispose of Monopoly Power An important goal of the antitrust
   remedy should be to prevent or deter future antitrust violations, and
   to deprive violators of the fruits of their illegal actions. Dr. Litan
   explains: Fortunately, the Supreme Court also has provided guidance on
   several occasions for evaluating relief in monopolization cases,
   announcing that the remedy should terminate the illegal monopoly;
   prevent practices likely to result in monopolization in the future; and
   deny to the defendant the fruits of its statutory violation. See, e.g.,
   United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corporation, 391 U.S. 244, 255
   (1968). Or, as the Court spoke in United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384
   U.S. 563, 577 (1966), relief in a Sherman Act case "should put an end
   to the combination and deprive the defendants of any of the benefits of
   the illegal conduct, and break up or render impotent the monopoly power
   found to be in violation of the Act." (Emphasis added).12 (Litan Brief,
   p. 9; see also pp. 15, 24, 27-28) Likewise, as both the Plaintiffs and
   the District Court recognized: The proposed final judgment is
   represented to the Court as incorporating provisions employed
   successfully in the past, and it appears to the Court to address all
   the principal objectives of relief in such cases, namely, to terminate
   the unlawful conduct, to prevent its repetition in the future, and to
   revive competition in the relevant markets. (United States v. Microsoft
   Corp., 97 F.Supp. 2d 59, 63, D.D.C. 2000) 12[Litan Brief, note 2] See
   also United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 340 U.S. 76, 88 (1950)
   [a decree must "pry open to competition a market that has been closed
   by defendants' illegal restraints."]; and United States v. E. I. du
   Pont de Nemours & Co., 366 U.S. 316, 326 (1961). 13 C. Intellectual
   Property Rights One constraint upon a forward-looking antitrust remedy
   (as opposed to a fine or payment of damages for past bad behavior) is
   that no current property of Microsoft may be taken without "just
   compensation." Naturally, this includes physical property, but it also
   includes arbitrary confiscation of intellectual property, such as
   patents, copyrights, or trade secrets.13 Nevertheless, such patent,
   copyright, or trade secret monopolies (otherwise legal) can be
   non-arbitrarily denied further enforcement or permitted only partial
   enforcement, if they are determined to be part of a monopolization
   scheme in violation of the antitrust laws. Hence, prior courts have
   ordered the non-enforcement of patent monopolies, or required their
   licensing on terms set by the Court. (Litan Brief, p. 38) Patents cover
   an inventor's "idea" for a practical application having utility, which
   may be embodied in material form or as a method (including computer
   programs). Copyrights, on the other hand, do not protect either ideas
   or functional utilities. Copyrights only protect against imitators who
   would simply copy works of art or literature (including computer
   programs). Copyrights do not protect against imitation of ideas or
   functional utilities (which may be embodied in computer programs), so
   long as the imitation is not done through copying. Patents and
   copyrights enjoy Constitutional and statutory protection. Trade secrets
   do not enjoy Constitutional protection. Trade secrecy does not prevent
   imitation by any lawful means, for example, by literal copying, through
   reverse engineering, or otherwise. Trade secrecy simply prohibits theft
   of trade secrets by unlawful means, such 13For a more detailed
   overview, see Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual
   Property, US DOJ & FTC, April 6, 1995. 14 as breaking and entering
   Microsoft headquarters, hacking into Microsoft computers, bribing
   Microsoft employees, and so forth. The public's interest in maintaining
   an orderly society argues against such disorderly conduct by private
   parties, and argues in favor of preventing disorderly persons from
   achieving the fruits (e.g., trade secrets) of their disorderly conduct.
   The same considerations do not prevent the government from ordering, in
   an orderly fashion, the divulgence or revelation of trade secrets.
   Where trade secrets, or a general pattern of trade secrecy, is used to
   protect monopolies, there is no Constitutional impediment to obligating
   Microsoft to reveal such trade secrets, in whole or in part. Microsoft,
   in part, uses trade secrecy to acquire value from its intellectual
   innovations. Microsoft, in part, uses trade secrecy to maintain as
   proprietary information a Windows standard, upon which much of the
   computer world must rely. A mere "standard" is not an intellectual
   innovation of much value in itself. Standards exist both inside and
   outside the computer world, and most standards are public information,
   not proprietary information. The Court may properly order Microsoft to
   divulge some or all of its software "standards", without thereby
   confiscating Microsoft's "intellectual property." D. Cost-Benefit
   Analysis to Determine Best Remedy among Several Alternatives
   Cost-benefit analysis is a set of techniques developed by economists
   over a period of decades for analyzing a variety of practical problems
   in a variety of contexts.14 Benefits and costs can be calculated from a
   variety of perspectives, including that of a particular individual, a
   particular group, the nation as a whole, or even the whole world.
   Typically, 14A document which describes the current state of
   benefit-cost analysis is Economic Analysis of Federal Regulations Under
   Executive Order 12866 , OMB, January 11, 1996. 15 the calculation is
   summarized by a Net Benefit figure (total benefits minus total costs).
   Where feasible, it is appropriate to express all benefits and costs in
   monetary units. For purposes of selecting an antitrust remedy, it is
   important to ascertain which benefits and costs will be used to
   calculate the Net Benefit of any proposed antitrust remedy. The scope
   of the proceeding would seem to limit the accounting to only antitrust-
   related benefits and costs, rather than other types of benefits and
   costs (e.g., health, safety, or environment), unless such other
   benefits and costs are interactively related to the antitrust benefits
   and costs. Since it is not the purpose of the antitrust laws to
   redistribute income, gains and losses to rich people are weighted in
   the same manner as gains and losses to poor people. Likewise, gains and
   losses to producers are weighted in the same manner as gains and losses
   to consumers. However, it is a premise of the antitrust laws that
   certain gains to monopoly sellers (or monopsony buyers) are
   illegitimate and unproductive. For purposes of calculating the
   legitimate costs and benefits to society, such illegitimate gains
   should be excluded from the net benefit calculation. Thus, when
   evaluating whether to approve a merger, the DOJ estimates whether the
   merger will result in a higher price or a lower price.15 The price
   might rise due to monopoly power; the price might fall due to increased
   efficiency in production. Even if production efficiency would increase,
   if prices rise, the merger is not approved, even if producers would
   gain more than consumers lose. This is because the gain in monopoly
   profits for producers is viewed as illegitimate, and therefore is not
   counted as a legitimate 15Benefits and costs other than price are also
   considered. See Horizontal Merger Guidelines, US DOJ and FTC, issued
   April 2, 1992, revised April 8, 1997. 16 benefit for society under the
   antitrust laws. Many issues affecting remedy can be placed in a
   cost-benefit framework. For example, it has been much discussed whether
   Microsoft is "trustworthy." Indicators of trustworthiness can be such
   factors as whether Microsoft previously obeyed Court orders, whether
   Microsoft witnesses gave trustworthy testimony, whether Microsoft
   accepts and repents of its law violations, whether Microsoft's
   violations were a single act or a series of orchestrated acts, whether
   Microsoft could reasonably believe that its actions were lawful, and so
   forth. The issue of trustworthiness necessarily affects the
   cost-benefit calculation of conduct remedies vis-a-vis structural
   remedies. If Microsoft is trustworthy, then conduct remedies may
   require minimal monitoring and enforcement action by the DOJ, and the
   benefits fairly certain. On the other hand, if Microsoft is
   untrustworthy, monitoring and enforcement actions could prove to be
   quite costly, while the benefits would be uncertain and spotty. Indeed,
   if the cost of enforcement exceeded the normal budget of the DOJ, a
   conduct remedy would need to include a special set-up (at Microsoft's
   expense) of an independent entity to enforce the remedy provisions
   against Microsoft. However, Microsoft's trustworthiness is not the sole
   factor affecting a choice between conduct remedies and structural
   remedies. Another major factor is the extent to which Microsoft is
   earning illegitimate monopoly profits as a result of prior violations.
   If the antitrust violation is a too-aggressive approach to the
   competitive threat posed by Netscape/Java, the illegitimate profits
   result from two factors: 1) Illegitimate profits resulting directly
   from the improper elimination of the Netscape/Java threat. 2)
   Illegitimate profits resulting indirectly, by developing a reputation
   for overly aggressive toughness, so as to deter 17 future competitive
   threats which may arise from future innovation. Neither set of
   illegitimate profits can be measured precisely, because neither the
   future nor the past can be re-run and measured under the counterfactual
   assumption that Microsoft committed no violations. However, estimates
   of the likelihood and extent of such profits can certainly be made. If
   these illegitimate profits are estimated to be large, then the Net
   Benefit of a conduct remedy is likely to be low relative to the Net
   Benefit of a structural remedy. Alternatively, if these illegitimate
   profits are estimated to be low or nonexistent, then the Net Benefit of
   a conduct remedy may be relatively higher, provided it is enforceable.
   E. Limited Presumption in Favor of the Government's Preferred Remedy
   The government has the burden to prove, by a preponderance of evidence,
   that Microsoft violated the antitrust laws. After meeting that burden
   and obtaining a conviction, there is some presumption that the
   government's proposed remedy is correct. That presumption can be
   overcome, by a preponderance of evidence, that another remedy (or no
   remedy) would better serve the public interest. The government's remedy
   may be too much, too little, not the right type, or otherwise not the
   best. If the government's proposal goes too far, Microsoft can be
   counted on to argue against it. If the government's remedy goes not far
   enough, or is otherwise not the best, only a third party, or an
   actively involved, highly competent, and assertive Court, can supply
   the needed correction. The remedy Court, after reviewing the evidence
   and opinions offered by the Plaintiff, Defendant, and third parties,
   should rank all remedy proposals (including any of the Court's own
   devising) from best to worst. Only the best proposal(s) should be
   considered further. If any two or more proposals are tied for first
   place, and no further investigation can tip the scales, the government
   may 18 choose from the first place winners. III. The Plaintiffs'
   Proposed Remedy Is Neither Obviously Best, Nor Demonstrated to Be Best
   A. Plaintiffs' Remedy Causes Potential Harms, in Exchange for Limited
   and Inadequate Benefits The remedy plan devised by the government
   appears poorly designed to meet the important objective of eliminating
   Microsoft's monopoly power in the markets for operating systems, Office
   software, and Internet browsers. The government proposes to divide the
   tri- part Microsoft monopoly into two monopolies, and then hope the two
   smaller monopolies will eventually compete with each other. Indeed, one
   government witness limply suggests that the two monopolists might
   simply "foster competition" with each other. The operative word here is
   "hope", not realistic expectation, that robust software competition
   will re-emerge in these markets. As the government acknowledges, the
   truly threatening competition to Microsoft, Netscape and Java, has
   essentially died away, and there is no definite prognosis that another
   truly threatening competitor will soon emerge. Even under an optimistic
   scenario, actual and serious competition will take years to develop,
   after the government's proposed break up occurs. Under a pessimistic
   scenario, competition may not develop at all. The pessimistic scenario
   is just as plausible as the optimistic scenario. The government's
   proposal therefore permits Microsoft to enjoy for several years,
   perhaps even indefinitely, the fruits of Microsoft's illegal
   monopolization campaign. The benefits of this remedy are limited.
   Indeed, the benefits appear inadequate. The potential costs of the
   remedy are two-fold. One is the problem of "double- marginalization".
   If two monopolists over complementary products separately charge their
   19 respective profit-maximizing prices, the price will be higher and
   consumers worse off, than if the two monopolists colluded or a single
   monopolist set both prices. Adequate competition in one or both markets
   may be able to contain this problem. The second problem is that
   arbitrarily preventing two different software products from linking
   together, except at "arms length", may forego the possibility of useful
   kinds of integration. This problem may be tolerable, if all important
   integrated software is easily developed at "arms length", or if there
   exists no commercially important potential development of integrated
   software. While the District Court has found, strictly as a factual
   matter, that past "integration" of Windows software with browser
   software was a sham, this says little about future possibilities of
   genuine integration having significant consumer value. In any case, the
   likelihood of future possibilities is a factual matter that should be
   explored in remedy hearings, if the Plaintiffs continue to support this
   remedy. Arguably, under certain assumptions, both potential harms may
   be limited in nature, but they are a potential cost of a remedy
   proposal which offers limited benefits. B. Plaintiffs' Remedy May Rest
   upon a Misdiagnosis of the Problem to Be Solved Plaintiffs' remedy
   rests too much on a narrow reading of the historical record. In the
   past, Microsoft used its monopoly operating system to obtain a monopoly
   in Internet browser software. Although not presented as evidence in
   this case, Plaintiffs believe that in the past Microsoft used its
   monopoly operating system to obtain a monopoly in Office software.
   Ergo, the operating system monopoly is being abused to form monopolies
   in various kinds of applications. Hence, the operating system monopoly
   is especially pernicious, and if cordoned off from abusive integration
   with applications, then all will be well. 20 However, the testimony
   offered by the Plaintiffs in the remedy stage of trial paints a
   somewhat different picture. That testimony suggests that both the
   Office software monopoly, and the Internet browser monopoly, can just
   as easily act as potential platforms for the extension of monopoly
   power into other applications. Moreover, Plaintiffs argue that the
   operating system monopoly for personal computers (most often used as
   "client computers" in a computer network) is being integrated (usefully
   and/or abusively) to help Microsoft obtain a monopoly over "server
   computer" operating systems. In other words, dividing Microsoft in two
   along the lines suggested by Plaintiffs, merely slows down, but does
   not really defeat Microsoft's ability to extend its monopolies into
   additional software sectors. There exists a different, broader, and
   more general way of looking at Plaintiffs' evidence. One of the
   underlying causes of Microsoft's successful predatory behavior is the
   extensive use of trade secrecy as an anti-competitive weapon. At the
   retail level, Microsoft code is essentially compiled code, whose
   meaning is virtually incomprehensible to humans. Human programmers
   normally program in higher-level, "source-code" computer languages,
   which are then translated by machine into compiled code. Microsoft has
   amassed a very large structure of interlocking machine code, and used
   trade secrecy with respect to source code as an anti-competitive weapon
   both to maintain and to expand its monopolies. Looked at more
   generally, a monopoly in any "must-have" software program, be it Office
   software, browsers, or operating systems, can be abusively integrated
   into any other software category with respect to which a monopoly is
   also desired. The extension of monopoly power can just as easily move
   from application to operating system, as from operating system to
   application. It is merely historical happenstance that Microsoft moved
   21 from operating systems to applications; the movement could just as
   easily be the reverse, as Plaintiffs hypothesize was the competitive
   threat posed to Microsoft by Netscape/Java. A different diagnosis leads
   to different suggestions for remedy. Two suggestions are immediately
   apparent: 1) Break up Microsoft into two or three companies that
   compete in each of Microsoft's lines of business, thereby breaking up
   all of Microsoft's monopolies simultaneously. 2) Require Microsoft to
   give up its trade secrecy in source code, which is the basic weapon in
   Microsoft's anticompetitive strategy. C. Plaintiffs Failed to
   Demonstrate That Alternative Conventional Remedies Are Not Better The
   two suggestions just mentioned may be called "conventional" because
   they do not require any invention of new knowledge or techniques, and
   were already publicly suggested months before Plaintiffs finally agreed
   upon and proposed a remedy. With respect to the first suggestion, none
   of Plaintiffs' three economist witnesses (Drs. Henderson, Romer,
   Shapiro) addresses the issue of whether or not it would be better
   simply to break up Microsoft within all its lines of business, so as to
   introduce competition into Microsoft's businesses directly and
   immediately. Plaintiffs' "reasons" for rejecting obvious solutions
   consist of a mere two sentences in their remedies brief, unsupported by
   any other evidence or testimony.16 Plaintiffs' three economists
   basically state only that the government 16Plaintiffs' purported
   reasons are: "[1] There could be efficiency losses because the division
   of all operating system personnel among multiple companies might
   disrupt engineering units and could result in unnecessary duplication;
   [2] in addition, particularly in an industry characterized by network
   effects, rivalry among identical products tends to offer less long-run
   competition and consumer choice than among differentiated products."
   [3] [The government proposal]... "does not raise the efficiency
   concerns that a division of Microsoft's operating business might
   entail." ("Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Support of Proposed Final
   Judgement", April 28, 2000, pp. 8, 9, public redacted version,
   bracketed numbers added.) 22 plan is a good plan; they do not testify
   that it is the best plan. The second "conventional" remedy suggestion
   is somewhat peculiar to the software industry itself, but nonetheless
   is applicable to Microsoft. The "open-source" movement, most notably
   among Linux developers, has two premises: 1) The source code for all
   open- source compiled code should be publicly available. 2) The
   open-source code may be taken and used without pay, and any programs
   using that source code will likewise be subject to the open- source
   provisions. The first provision makes a great deal of sense, and is a
   potential solution for preventing Microsoft from using trade secrecy as
   an anticompetitive weapon. The second provision is a requirement of
   charity, and would likely not be imposed by an antitrust court upon the
   for-profit Microsoft. Instead, Microsoft should retain its copyrights
   and patent rights to both source code and compiled code, while being
   obligated to license such code on reasonable terms. Such licensing
   should allow fractional portions of code to be purchased at reduced
   rates from the purchase of whole code. Both of these conventional
   remedies would bring about competition directly, and with more
   certainty, than the Plaintiffs' two-monopolies proposal. In addition,
   both of these conventional remedies would be consistent with allowing
   the development of integrated products, which might include aspects of
   what we currently call "operating systems" and "applications." Hence,
   both of these alternatives would be associated with greater benefits,
   and fewer harms, than the Plaintiffs' current remedy proposal. D.
   Plaintiffs Failed to Consider or Explain Rejection of Promising
   Unconventional Remedies Brought to Their Attention Finally, there is a
   third pro-competitive action which the Plaintiffs could have advocated,
   but did not advocate. This might be called an "unconventional" remedy,
   since it 23 rests upon new economic knowledge or invention. This
   unconventional remedy would use relative profit maximizing ("RPM")
   incentives. RPM incentives can be implemented by rearranging the
   compensation of business managers so that the business firms they
   manage are placed into a "zero-sum game." This alternative incentive
   scheme for business managers can reduce or eliminate incentives for
   collusion and predatory behavior, even when there are as few as two
   business firms in the same market. This incentive scheme can be
   implemented in more that one manner. In December 1999, I wrote a letter
   to all parties in the unsuccessful Microsoft mediation process before
   Judge Posner.17 In that letter I suggested a proposal to divide
   Microsoft into two equal-sized companies in each of its lines of
   business, and then placing these two firms into a zero-sum game with
   each other using RPM incentives. That initial proposal is not the only
   possible application of RPM incentives to Microsoft. One can use RPM
   incentives with respect to any two or more firms. In particular, even
   if we assume that the government's two-monopolies proposal is the best
   of the conventional remedies, RPM incentives can make the government's
   remedy even better. The government hopes that eventually these two
   monopolies will start competing with each other. RPM incentives can
   help assure this competition, and avoid tacit collusion. With respect
   to amicus' original proposal, or other possible uses of RPM incentives,
   neither the District Court, nor the DOJ, has shown the slightest
   interest or curiosity. Neither the DOJ nor any of DOJ's economists or
   attorneys has called or written to ask questions, nor 17Carl Lundgren,
   "An Open Letter to All Parties in the Microsoft Antitrust Mediation
   Process," December 2, 1999. 24 invited the amicus to any interviews,
   seminars, or discussions concerning the invention, or its possible
   application to Microsoft or any other antitrust case, past, present, or
   future, whether actual, pending, or hypothetical. For its part, the
   District Court denied the timely filing of an amicus brief, and also
   denied amicus' timely motion to intervene. CONCLUSION The District
   Court, perhaps unwittingly, abused its discretion by failing to hold
   substantive remedy hearings that would admit third parties. This
   deprived the public of substantive procedural rights, which prevents
   proper evaluation of the public interest. Moreover, the District Court
   adopted too strong a presumption in favor of the government's proposed
   remedy, and rashly adopted a government remedy proposal that is both
   inadequate and inadequately explained. Institution of remedy
   proceedings that admit third parties will provide competition within
   the Court room to advocate best remedies. Such competition will promote
   innovation, quality, and efficiency in antitrust remedies, laudable
   goals which the DOJ advocates for Microsoft, the computer industry, and
   the private sector generally. The Appeals Court should provide the
   District Court with further instruction on these matters. Respectfully
   submitted. ___________________________________ Carl Lundgren Valmarpro
