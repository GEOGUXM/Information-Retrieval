      Commission Adopts New Threshold for Reporting Occupation and Employer
      Information
      The Public Disclosure Commission adopted amendments to existing rules
      which changed the threshold at which campaigns report information
      concerning an individual contributor's occupation and employer. The
      current threshold, adopted in 1993, was set at contributions of $100 or
      more. Today's action changes that threshold amount to more than $100.
      Commissioners Lois Clement and Ronda Cahill opposed the revision.
      A representative of the League of Women Voters of Washington, Cherie
      Davidson, expressed to the Commission that it might be time to consider
      a change that reflects the inflation of campaign costs. Davidson stated
      that if this change is proposed in order to make running for office
      less cumbersome, we believe that it has some merit. She said, "We are
      just unsure whether the amounts proposed are meaningful today with the
      tremendous increase in campaign spending."
      The issue had been raised by State Representative David Schmidt who
      indicated that the current rule of identifying occupation and employer
      information at $100 or more added to the already heavy workload of
      volunteer campaign treasurers.
      The Commission also made changes to PDC forms C3, C4, Schedule B and
      Schedule L, repealed PDC form C4abb and an unnecessary electronic
      filing rule and amended the rule on PDC form C7 to reflect current and
      future changes in contribution limits triggering the annual report of
      major contributors.
        * Amended WAC 390-16-031 Forms for Statement of Contributions
          Deposit. This amendment reflects the new reporting threshold for
          reporting occupation and employer information, adds a space to
          include the date of election and clarifies that paper amendments to
          the form should be submitted on 8 x 11 white paper.
        * Amended WAC 390-16-041 Forms - Summary of Total Contributions and
          Expenditures. This amendment eliminates the C4abb reporting form
          that is no longer needed, changes PDC forms Schedule B and Schedule
          L to conform with the new threshold for reporting occupation and
          employer information, adds a space to include the date of election
          and clarifies that paper amendments to the form should be submitted
          on 8 x 11 white paper.
        * Repealed WAC 390-16-190 Electronic Filing. The repeal results from
          statutory changes under RCW 42.17.3691 requiring electronic filing
          by certain candidates and political committees. This rule is no
          longer needed.
        * Amended WAC 390-16-071 Annual report of major contributors and
          personas making independent expenditures. This amendment
          incorporates a reference to WAC 390-05-400 in WAC 390-16-071 rather
          than a current specific dollar amount. The proposed change would
          eliminate the need to revise WAC 390-16-071 when the Commission
          adjusts the Initiative 134 dollar amounts in accordance with RCW
          42.17.690.

   Advisory Matter
   The Commission adopted amendments to a prior PDC Interpretation (01-01)
   involving the participation in fund raising events by state officials
   during Legislative Freeze periods. The Commission amended the language
   to recognize that local office candidates (who do not hold state
   office) are not subject to the Session Freeze provisions under RCW
   42.17.710 and the language that says a state official's name cannot be
   featured in candidate's fundraiser invitation. This amendment would
   allow a state elected official to be included on a fundraising
   invitation for a candidate and clarifies that if a political party
   distributes a Lincoln or Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner invitation
   listing the names of state elected officials who will attend, that
   listing by itself does not mean that the officials have solicited or
   accepted contributions for the party. See PDC Interpretation 01-04 for
   more details.
   Enforcement Action
   The Commission rejected a proposed stipulated agreement between the
   staff of the PDC and James White, Mayor of the City of Kent and
   requested the enforcement matter be held over until the January 22,
   2001 meeting. White is charged with violating the law by knowingly
   soliciting contributions from employees of the City of Kent and by
   using public facilities to assist his campaign for re-election as Mayor
   of Kent.
   The Commission also levied a civil penalty against Lawrence Soriano,
   candidate for Seattle School Board, for violating RCW 42.17.040,
   42.17.080 and 42.17.090 by exceeding limits of the Mini reporting
   option. Mr. Soriano was fined $1,000 with $500 suspended if no future
   violations of RCW 42.17 occur during the next four years.
   Request for Review
     * The Commission reduced the civil penalty from $250 to $100 for
       Charles Styger, School Director, Napavine School District #14, who
       was found in violation of RCW 42.17.240 at a brief enforcement
       hearing on July 30, 2001 for failing to file a statement of
       personal financial affairs.

   Request for Reconsideration
     * Gary Morgan, Candidate for City Council, City of Brier, was found
       in violation of RCW 42.17.240 at a brief enforcement hearing on
       September 24, 2001 for failing to file a statement of personal
       financial affairs and was assessed a $100 civil penalty. His
       request for reconsideration was denied.
     * David Neizwaag, Commissioner, Ritzville Park and Recreation
       District #4, was found in violation of RCW 42.17.240 at a brief
       enforcement hearing on July 30, 2001 for failing to file a
       statement of personal financial affairs and was assessed a $100
       civil penalty. His request for reconsideration was denied.
     * Samuel Udom, Candidate for City Council, City of Tukwilla, was
       found in violation of RCW 42.17.240 and RCW 42.17.040 at a brief
       enforcement hearing on September 24, 2001 for failing to file a
       statement of personal financial affairs and failure to file a
       candidate registration (PDC form C1). He was assessed a $150 civil
       penalty. His request for reconsideration was denied.
     * Cecil Stuurmans, School Director, Coupeville School District #204.
       was found in violation of RCW 42.17.240 at a brief enforcement
       hearing on July 30, 2001 for failing to file a statement of
       personal financial affairs and was assessed a $100 civil penalty.
       His request for reconsideration was denied.

   Reporting Modifications
   The Commission granted a partial reporting modification of the
   information required on the Personal Financial Affairs Statement to
   Steve Hill, Regent, Washington State University and exempted the
   reporting of business and governmental customers of the Weyerhaeuser
   Company, Seattle Symphony Orchestra and Corporate Council for the Arts,
   entities of which he is a director, officer or trustee.
   The Commission renewed, with minor changes, a previous reporting
   modification for the IBEW Local 77 PAC.
