   The Vision
                     ___________________________________

   The goal of astronomy is to make the distant appear close, since the
   extreme distances of the Universe obscure our view of its components
   and hide the workings of nature. Through the use of telescopes,
   astronomers have improved our vision, and physical understanding of the
   Universe has followed.

    Top right: HST image of the core of galaxy M87. Bottom left: Simulated
                     MAXIM image of the region near the black hole in M87.

   The Hubble Space Telescope represents the greatest clarity of vision
   ever achieved by a major observatory at visible wavelengths. The 0.1
   arcsecond resolution it achieved is only 600 times finer than that
   experienced with the naked eye. But, the results have been stunning
   anyway.

   Intercontinental baseline radio interferometry has produced images with
   milli-arcsecond resolution, 100 times finer than that of HST. With
   these images, astronomers have probed deep into the hearts of quasars
   and the Milky Way Galaxy.

   The MAXIM concept utilizes X-ray interferometry to achieve
   micro-arcsecond angular resolution. A NASA mission built around this
   concept could achieve resolution as fine as 300 nano-arcseconds. This
   resolution is 3,000 times finer than VLBI and 300,000 times finer than
   HST.

   X-ray interferometry has the potential to resolve the event horizon of
   a supermassive black hole in the nucleus of a nearby galaxy and at the
   center of our galaxy. This is equivalent to
     * resolving a feature the size of a dinner plate on the surface of
       the sun,
     * observing a 100 km emission knot on the surface of Alpha Centauri,
     * imaging the disk of a star in the Magellanic CLouds,
     * mapping in detail the accretion disk at the center of the Milky
       Way,
     * directly measuring the parallax of a star in the Virgo Cluster of
       galaxies, or
     * resolving one-tenth of a light year at the far extent of the
       visible Universe.

   Of course, X-ray images differ greatly from visible images. X-rays are
   emitted only under conditions considered extreme by humans.
   Temperatures of millions of degrees and magnetic fields of millions of
   Gauss can create X-rays. They are often associated with the dramatic
   events heralding both the birth and death of astronomical objects. As
   such, they come from compact regions and image the core structures in
   some of the most interesting events in the Universe. This is the
   antithesis of structures viewed in radio VLBI, which are usually
   created by high energy electrons expanding away from the central
   structure. With X-rays we see the central engine itself.

   An advance of three to five orders of magnitude in clarity is
   guaranteed to provide a basic new view of the Universe.
