                   National Science and Technology Council


   The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) was established by
   Executive Order on November 23, 1993. This Cabinet-level Council is the
   principal means for the President to coordinate science, space, and
   technology to coordinate the diverse parts of the Federal research and
   development enterprise. The President chairs the NSTC. Membership
   consists of the Vice President, Assistant to the President for Science
   and technology, Cabinet Secretaries and Agency Heads with significant
   science and technology responsibilities, and other White House
   officials.
   An important objective of the NSTC is the establishment of clear
   national goals for Federal science and technology investments in areas
   ranging from information technologies and health research, to improving
   transportation systems and strengthening fundamental research. The
   Council prepares research and development strategies that are
   coordinated across Federal agencies to form an investment package aimed
   at accomplishing multiple national goals.
