     [Coastal/Regional:mangrove inlet image] AOML coastal research is
     important in assessing the current and future affect on human
     activities on our coastal to deep ocean and atmospheric
     environments. Research projects range from salinity manitoring in
     Florida Bay to measuring rainfall using underwater acoustic devices.

     [Tropical Meteorology:plane in storm image] AOML's hurricane
     research aims to improve forecasts and advance the basic physical
     understanding of hurricanes and tropical meteorology. A key aspect
     of AOML's hurricane research is its annual program of research
     flights aboard reconnaissance aircraft (two WP-3D turboprops and a
     new Gulfstream IV SP jet) flown by NOAA's Aircraft Operations
     Center.

     [Ocean/Climate:bird flying over ocean in sunset image] AOML research
     related to Oceans and Climate is critical to understanding and
     predicting seasonal to decadal shifts in weather patterns and are
     used in studies to understand dynamical processes in the global
     ocean/atmosphere coupled system AOML scientists monitor and study
     fluxuations in the currents within the Atlantic Ocean and their
     relationship to climatic events ranging from US rainfall rates to
     hurricane development.
