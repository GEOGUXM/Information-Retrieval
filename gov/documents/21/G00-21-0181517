                      Latest Energy Market Developments

   Oil prices were down today in world markets, following about a week of
   daily increases. Yesterday (January 28), West Texas Intermediate crude
   futures prices (for March delivery) on the NYMEX closed at $20.05 per
   barrel. This represented a gain of around $2 per barrel since Friday,
   January 18, when front month futures prices closed at $18 per barrel.
   The increase was ascribed mainly to decreased refinery runs and a
   growing belief that OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts were beginning to
   take effect and to impact the world oil supply/demand balance. With
   warm weather in much of the United States and Europe (and forecasts
   indicating that this could continue for several more days), uncertain
   indicators regarding world economic recovery, and contradictory reports
   as to OPEC quota compliance (see below), oil prices may now be moving
   into somewhat less "bullish" territory than during the past week or
   two. One potentially "bullish" factor which oil traders are watching is
   the tense situation in the Middle East, specifically the
   Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

   World oil producers, led by OPEC, have been attempting for more than
   two months to bolster prices by reining in production in the face of
   weak world oil demand. OPEC's 1.5-million-barrel-per-day quota
   reduction took effect officially on January 1, 2002. A combined
   462,500-barrel-per-day cut by major non-OPEC oil producers (Russia,
   Norway, Mexico, Oman, and Angola) also was slated to take effect on
   that date. According to a report by the tanker tracking company
   Petrologistics, OPEC (excluding Iraq) appears to have cut its
   production this month by 1.34 million barrels per day, to 22.36 million
   barrels per day, or 659,000 barrels per day above the "OPEC 10" target.
   This represents a compliance rate significantly higher than many
   analysts had predicted. In contrast to the Petrologistics report, Dow
   Jones Newswires released a survey this morning which shows OPEC cutting
   production by only 884,000 barrels per day in January, which would put
   OPEC production at more than 1 million barrels per day above OPEC's
   official target, and close to what many analysts (including EIA) had
   assumed.

   Other recent developments in energy markets include:
     * EIA reported yesterday (January 28) that the average U.S. retail
       motor gasoline price fell 0.4 cents per gallon over the past week,
       to 110.1 cents per gallon, which is 35.9 cents per gallon below the
       price one year ago. Diesel prices rose slightly (0.4 cents per
       gallon) after three weeks of declines, and are nearly 40 cents per
       gallon below year-ago levels.
     * Natural gas prices continue to decline on warm weather, weak
       industrial demand, increased availability of nuclear generating
       capacity, and record-high natural gas storage levels for this time
       of year.
     * Coal supplies are ample. Coal prices appear to be trending
       downwards, in part due to relatively mild winter weather.
     * Electricity prices throughout the country fell last week due to
       mild weather and decreased power demand. Prices increased in the
       western United States on Sunday and Monday due to expected colder
       weather and increased heating demand.

                         World Oil Market Highlights

   International Oil Supply and Demand
   To date, no oil supply shortages have materialized in connection with
   terrorist attacks or ongoing military operations. For 2001, world oil
   supply was essentially unchanged, and for 2002, is expected to decline
   by about 450,000 barrels per day. OPEC supply is forecast to fall by
   1.5 million barrels per day in 2002 compared to 2001, while non-OPEC
   supply is expected to increase by 1 million barrels per day.

   World oil demand growth slowed significantly following the September 11
   terrorist attacks on the United States, in part due to a worsening of
   economic conditions and in part due to sharply reduced commercial jet
   fuel demand. The latest EIA estimate of world oil demand growth for
   2001 is 100,000 barrels per day, totalling 75.8 million barrels per day
   in 2001. This growth estimate is nearly 90% below early September's
   projections for 2001 as a whole. For 2002, world oil demand is expected
   to grow by about 730,000 barrels per day, to 76.5 million barrels per
   day. About 340,000 barrels per day of this growth is expected to come
   from the developed (OECD) countries, with 385,000 barrels per day
   coming from non-OECD countries.

   World Excess Oil Production Capacity
   According to first quarter 2002 estimates, the world holds around
   6.8-7.3 million barrels per day of excess oil production capacity,
   about 93% of which lies in OPEC countries. This is an increase from
   fourth quarter 2001 estimates, based on OPEC's January 1, 2002
   production cuts, and it brings world excess oil production capacity to
   its highest levels since 1987/1988. Around two-fifths of current world
   excess production capacity total is located in Saudi Arabia.

   U.S. and other OECD Oil Import Sources
   During the first ten months (January-October) of 2001, the United
   States imported around 9.2 million barrels per day of crude oil. Of
   this, about 48% came from the Western Hemisphere (19% from South
   America, 14.5% from Mexico, 14% from Canada), while 29% came from the
   Persian Gulf region (18% from Saudi Arabia, 8% from Iraq, 3% from
   Kuwait), and the remainder mainly from three other countries -- Nigeria
   (9%), Norway (3%) and the United Kingdom (2%).

                    Graph of U.S. oil imports by country

   In general, OECD Europe depends far more heavily on the Persian Gulf
   and North Africa for its oil imports than does the United States.
   During the first six months of 2001, nearly two-fifths of OECD Europe's
   net oil imports came from the Persian Gulf (mainly Saudi Arabia, Iran,
   Iraq, and Kuwait), around one-third from Africa (mainly Libya, Algeria,
   and Nigeria), and much of the remainder from Russia. Japan receives
   over three-quarters of its oil supplies from the Persian Gulf (mainly
   the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, and Qatar) with the remainder
   coming from Indonesia, China, and other sources.

                Latest U.S. Weekly EIA Petroleum Information

   Crude Oil Inputs Fall; Are Further Declines Yet to Come?
   After averaging 14.8 million barrels per day over the previous 6 weeks,
   U.S. crude oil refinery inputs fell to 14.6 million barrels per day for
   the week ending January 18, as a result of both planned and unplanned
   refinery outages (see U.S. Crude Oil Refinery Inputs table and chart on
   the crude oil page). With relatively high product inventories and low
   refinery margins, a decline in crude oil inputs in upcoming weeks would
   be expected, as evidenced by EIA's Short-Term Energy Outlook estimation
   that crude oil inputs will average about 14.4 million barrels per day
   in February. A lengthy decline in crude oil inputs would reduce
   refinery production of major petroleum products such as gasoline,
   heating oil, and diesel fuel. Data for the week ending January 18
   showed a large decline in diesel fuel production, which seemed logical
   as diesel fuel inventories had reached an historical high in the week
   ending January 11. If production of these key petroleum products is
   reduced as a result of less crude oil run through the refineries at the
   same time demand for these products remains relatively strong (more on
   this below), then a drawdown in product inventories over the next
   several weeks could be expected.

   Crude Oil Import Levels Could Be Key Factor This Quarter
   U.S. crude oil imports (excluding imports into the Strategic Petroleum
   Reserve) averaged 9.1 million barrels per day during the week ending
   January 18, 2002, the first week in which the average has exceeded 9
   million barrels per day since the week ending December 7, 2001 (see
   U.S. Crude Oil Imports table and chart on the crude oil page). However,
   with Iraqi crude oil imports reduced since December 2001 and OPEC,
   along with some major non-OPEC producing countries, agreeing to reduce
   crude oil production over the first half of the year, it is unclear if
   imports will continue to average above 9 million barrels per day for
   any significant length of time. With a transit time of about 40 days
   between the Persian Gulf and the United States, the decline in Iraqi
   exports to date probably has not yet appeared in U.S. import
   statistics. Moreover, any reduction in OPEC production that translates
   into decreased crude oil exports to the United States may not show up
   until February, March, or even April. Historically, OPEC cuts in
   production usually are maximized in the second or third month following
   a reduction in production quotas.

   U.S. Oil Demand Continues To Show Underlying Strength
   How can we say that U.S. oil demand is showing strength when over the
   past 4 weeks it has averaged nearly 1 million barrels per day less than
   last year? The answer lies in last year's demand, which was
   extraordinarily high. Looking back two years to January 2000, we see
   that oil demand averaged 19.03 million barrels per day, or over 0.5
   million barrels per day less than has been averaged thus far in January
   2002. This occurred, despite an ongoing recession and a reduction in
   jet fuel demand as a result of reduced air traffic following the
   September 11 attacks. Comparisons to year-ago demand levels are
   misleading, as cold weather and high natural gas prices encouraged
   unusually high demand for distillate fuel and residual fuel. Even with
   motor gasoline demand over the last 3 weeks down considerably from
   previous levels, the 4-week average of 8.4 million barrels per day is
   1.0% above the amount in the same period a year ago. If gasoline demand
   continues normal annual growth rates of 1% to 2%, jet fuel demand
   gradually increases as more flights get added, and distillate fuel
   demand continues to average between 3.8 and 4.0 million barrels per day
   over the next several weeks, then any decline in refinery production as
   described above could result in a drawdown in total product inventory
   levels. This could, in turn, put some upward pressure on retail product
   prices later this winter or in spring.

   Crude Oil Stocks Increased For the Week Ending January 18, But Total
   Product Stocks Declined
   Although commercial crude oil inventories (excluding inventories in the
   Strategic Petroleum Reserve) increased by 2.7 million barrels for the
   week ending January 18, total product inventories declined by 0.7
   million barrels, led by a 2.9-million-barrel decline in distillate fuel
   and a 3.2-million-barrel decline in "other oils". The decline in "other
   oils" stocks includes a seasonal decline of 3.3 million barrels in
   propane inventories, as winter weather contributed to push inventories
   lower. These declines more than made up for a large increase in
   gasoline inventories (3.6 million barrels) and smaller increases in
   unfinished oils (1.5 million barrels), residual fuel oil (0.3 million
   barrels), and jet fuel (0.1 million barrels). If both crude oil inputs
   and imports decline as expected over the next several weeks, it is
   possible that crude oil stocks will not increase significantly over
   this period while product inventories decline.

   Most Retail Petroleum Product Prices Fell Slightly Last Week
   The national average retail regular gasoline price dropped to 110.1
   cents per gallon on January 28, 2002, down 0.4 cents per gallon from
   last week and 35.9 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. Following 3
   weeks of declines, the national average retail diesel fuel price rose
   last week by 0.4 cents per gallon, reaching 114.4 cents per gallon on
   January 28, 2002, which is 39.5 cents per gallon less than it was a
   year ago.

   Residential heating oil prices continued their decline this week, as
   the average on January 21, 2002, stood at 116.2 cents per gallon, down
   0.4 cents per gallon from last week and 36.9 cents per gallon lower
   than a year ago. Residential propane prices were level this collection
   cycle, as the average on January 21, 2002, remained at 113.4 cents per
   gallon, which is down 55.9 cents per gallon from year ago prices.

                 Latest U.S. Weekly Natural Gas Information

   Industry/Market Developments
   Canadian Natural Gas in Storage. As in the United States, storage
   facilities in Canada are reporting much higher stock levels compared
   with the same time last year. The Canadian Gas Association reported
   that on January 18, 2002, a total of 413 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of
   working natural gas was in storage--close to 85% higher than last year.
   The majority of this gas is located in populous eastern Canadian
   provinces of Ontario and Quebec with a total of 224 Bcf, while western
   Canada had 189 Bcf on hand on January 18th.

   Natural Gas Storage
   Net withdrawals from storage were an estimated 124 Bcf for the week
   ended January 18, 2002, according to the American Gas Association
   (AGA). This marks the fourth week in a row that net withdrawals
   exceeded 100 Bcf, although the estimate of 124 Bcf falls 25 Bcf, or
   about 17%, below the 6-year (1995-2000) average for the week. With this
   lower-than-average total drawdown, stock levels (as estimated by EIA)
   are almost 31% above average, which is the largest percentage surplus
   over the 6-year average thus far in the heating season.

                          Natural gas stocks table

   Prices
   The general decline in spot market prices at the Henry Hub that began
   in early January has continued, as prices moved down $0.25 per MMBtu
   last week and decreased again to trade at $2.02 per MMBtu yesterday. It
   appears that the lack of any significant weather-related demand, the
   apparently weak industrial demand, the increased availability of
   nuclear generating capacity, and the record high storage levels for
   this time of year continue to apply downward price pressure. Citygate
   prices in the Northeast did move up slightly yesterday, but remain less
   than half the levels seen at the end of December. For example, the spot
   price at New York City (Transco Z-6) was $4.93 per MMBtu on December
   31, 2001, compared with $2.30 per MMBtu yesterday. Elsewhere, prices in
   Chicago are also down-from $2.99 per MMBtu on December 26, 2001, to
   $2.02 per MMBtu at the beginning of this week.

   As an indicator of expectations of continued market weakness, trading
   on the futures market for the February contract, which closes today
   (1/29/02), ended trading yesterday at $1.908 per MMBtu -- more than
   $0.86 per MMBtu below the level at which it began trading as the prompt
   month on December 28, 2001. It appears that the current February
   contract will close well over $4.00 per MMBtu below last year's
   contract, which terminated trading at $6.293 per MMBtu. Also at the end
   of trading yesterday (1/28/02), all contracts through the end of 2002
   settled below $2.90 per MMBtu, with prices ranging from February's
   $1.908 per MMBtu to December's $2.879 per MMBtu.

                        Latest U.S. Coal Information

   For the week ending January 19, EIA estimates U.S. coal production at
   21.4 million short tons. This was 5% lower than the comparable week in
   2000. Powder River Basin prices have fallen 50% from their May 2001
   highs but still are about 65% greater than this time last year, while
   the Central Appalachian prices at about $32/ton are only $2/ton above
   prices in January 2001. Helping to rein in spot prices, the mild
   weather in the East and Midwest through mid-December has kept
   electricity generation coal inventories high and curtailed bids and
   deliveries for near future purchases. Spot coal prices in the Uinta
   basin are holding steady at about 40% above year-ago levels, as are
   Northern Appalachian prices at about 50% above year-ago levels. In
   recent weeks, spot prices in the Illinois basin have receded to about
   33% above year-ago levels. With the exception of coal from the PRB,
   much of the coal produced in each major coal basin is consumed at sites
   that are in or relatively close to those coal basins. When price
   increases elsewhere are larger than PRB price increases, the area
   within which PRB coal is cost competitive expands: a 50% increase in
   f.o.b. price of the PRB's low price (on a calorific value basis)
   produces a smaller increase in delivered price than does a 50% f.o.b.
   price increase elsewhere. On this basis, prices across the markets
   appear to be in the correct relative alignment. But if PRB prices
   continue to fall, there most likely will be downward pressure on prices
   in the other basins. The current trend seems to be towards lower prices
   on the NYMEX.

                       Graph of coal prices by region

   In the long term, EIA expects domestic coal supplies to be more than
   adequate for projected consumption. Most coal is still sold under
   multi-year contracts, and average prices for all coal supply contracts,
   incorporating spot and long-term, are projected to stabilize at well
   below current spot prices. EIA’s projections of average coal prices
   decline slightly in inflation-adjusted dollars because nominal prices
   rise more slowly than the rate of inflation between 2001 and 2020.
   Customers choose coal because of its abundance and dependable
   availability, its relatively high Btu content, its low prices relative
   to other fossil fuels, and, compared with natural gas, much less price
   volatility.

                     Latest U.S. Electricity Information

   Selected Wholesale Electricity Prices (January 22 - January 28): From
   Tuesday through Saturday of last week, U.S. Western spot electricity
   prices decreased, in part because of mild weather and reduced demand
   for electricity. Prices for power flowing north on NP-15 decreased from
   $23.56 per megawatthour on January 22 to $22.63 per megawatthour on
   January 26. Prices for power flowing south on SP-15 decreased from
   $23.42 per megawatthour to $22.81 per megawatthour for the same dates.
   However, in anticipation of colder weather and increased heating
   demand, Western U.S. prices increased on January 28 compared to the
   early part of last week.

   The Northeast region showed a similar trend as the Western region. PJM
   West, Nepool, and New York ISO prices declined over the first part of
   last week, but increased on January 28. In addition to the table
   displaying spot prices over the past 7 days, a graph has been added
   displaying daily spot electricity prices over approximately the past 4
   months at 5 of the major trading centers. The data indicate clearly the

   As of January 29, 2002, the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR)
   contained 553.9 million barrels of oil. The SPR has a maximum drawdown
   capability of 4.1 million barrels per day for 90 days, with oil
   beginning to arrive in the marketplace 15 days after a presidential
   decision to initiate a drawdown. On November 13, 2001, President Bush
   ordered that the SPR be filled to its current physical capacity of 700
   million barrels. Oil shipments into the SPR have begun, and are
   expected to be completed by 2005.
