   Regional Offices

   Western has four regional offices, a management center and a corporate
   services office. The regional offices and management center put Western
   where our customers are. Each region markets power for specific
   multi-use water power projects. The Corporate Services Office in
   Lakewood, Colo., supports these offices and provides Western's
   administrative infrastructure. Its staff also manages central
   functions, such as Corporate Communications, Economic Impact and
   Diversity (EEO), Engineering and Environment.
