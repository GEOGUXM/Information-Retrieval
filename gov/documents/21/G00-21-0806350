                           Current Interest Rates

   Fixed Interest Rates

   Current municipal bond interest rates are now available to you by
   clicking on the Bloomberg Web site below. The bond yields of health
   care revenue bonds in Washington historically trade at yields higher
   than the national average yields listed in the Bloomberg Web site.
   Local underwriters and bond traders have informed us that "AAA" rated
   health care revenue bonds issued in Washington historically trade at 10
   to 15 basis points above the national "AAA" rated municipal bond yields
   shown in Bloomberg.
   The interest rates for "A" rated health care revenue bonds issued in
   Washington can be approximated by adding 20 to 25 basis points to each
   maturity on the national "AAA" rated municipal bond yields shown in
   Bloomberg.
