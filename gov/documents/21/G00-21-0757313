     Texas annual hydrologic data reports are a part of a series of
     annual reports that document hydrologic data collected from the U.S.
     Geological Surveyâ€™s collection networks in each State, Puerto Rico,
     and the Trust Territories.  These records of streamflow,
     ground-water levels, and quality of water provide the hydrologic
     information needed by Federal, State, local agencies, and the
     private sector for developing and managing land and water resources
     in Texas.
