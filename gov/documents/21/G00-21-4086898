   Air Traffic (AMA-500)

   The Air Traffic Academy is fostering student success with innovative
   and unmatchable training. Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) of the future
   will be the best trained, most confident controllers there can be, and
   that starts at the Air Traffic Academy in Oklahoma City.

   This year the Air Traffic Academy introduced the AT-SAT (Air Traffic
   Selection and Training) and the Multi-Path Training Program. This dual
   process assures that those individuals with the cognitive skills have
   several avenues available to them to enter the ATC career field. Once
   at the Academy, ATC students can be confident their training is
   conducted and supported by an innovative and dedicated group of experts
   whose goal is to provide training that is globally recognized as the
   best.

   "I see us known as the Center of Excellence and recognized as the
   critical-mass of knowledge for Air Traffic Training, not only
   domestically but also internationally, so that we become the source for
   training or a source for support for training world wide."
   -Ned Reese
