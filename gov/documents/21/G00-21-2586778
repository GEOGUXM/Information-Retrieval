PREFACE TO VERSION THREE

   VICAR is an evolving software system constantly being updated with
   contributions from general users and flight projects. This makes it
   difficult to keep a document such as this VICAR User's Guide
   up-to-date. Part of the purpose in putting this latest version online
   is to enable revisions in VICAR to be more quickly reflected in this
   Guide.

   Several significant changes have been made in this version of the
   Guide. An attempt has been made to keep the current format as similar
   as possible to past versions of the Guide, but for the online version,
   some changes have been made to take advantage of the cross-referencing
   capabilities of the NCSA Mosaic format. It is hoped that most of these
   changes will be transparent to anyone reading a hardcopy version. An
   attempt has been made once again to make the Index more useful in
   quickly finding critical information.

   There have also been significant changes to VICAR since Version 3 was
   published. Perhaps most important are those changes due to the
   conversion of VICAR to enable it to run on UNIX systems. (These changes
   are detailed in Section 3.1.1 for the benefit of the experienced
   VMS-VICAR user.) The content of the VICAR applications libraries has
   changed with the addition of many new procs and the deletion of several
   obsolete or redundant ones. Finally, the Menu mode and the New User's
   Tutorial are undergoing significant changes, and have not yet been
   implemented for UNIX VICAR.

   This version of the VICAR User's Guide applies to:

        VICAR Version 12.1
                using TAE Version 5B/16B
                under UNIX Version SunOS 4.1.3 or Solaris 2.3
        or      under VMS Version 5.4-2

   Version 3 of the VICAR User's Guide is an update of previous versions,
   and the authors relied heavily on those earlier versions for its
   content. The authors of Version 2 of the Guide are Susan LaVoie, Doug
   Alexander, Charles Avis, Helen Mortensen, Carol Stanley, and Lisa
   Wainio. The writing and HTML formatting of Version 3 were done by
   Elizabeth.D.Duxbury@jpl.nasa.gov and Danika.Jensen@jpl.nasa.gov. Last
