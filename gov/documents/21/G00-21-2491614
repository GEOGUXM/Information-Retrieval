                                 Objectives

               The primary thrust of the research will be concerned with
   the structural characterization of complex systems, as opposed to well
   defined model systems studied in conventional Solid State Physics. The
   principal investigators and their collaborators within their respective
   institutions possess a broad interdisciplinary background (including
   physics, chemistry, polymer science, materials science, and biology)
   and share a common interest in using the unique properties of the APS.
   Areas of interest include complex fluids, self-assembling systems,
   surfaces and interfaces, and novel materials.
               Characterization of the structure and phase behavior of
   liquid, polymer, and solid surfaces and interfaces is one of the
   central components of the scientific program of CMC. Scientifically,
   our interests lie in equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamic
   properties of surfaces and interfaces, including roughening and melting
   transformations, surface magnetic phase transformations, wetting and
   adsorption phenomena, and structural and phase behavior related to the
   sciences of adhesion and tribology. There are many systems, including
   metals, semiconductors, and insulators, where X-ray techniques are one
   of the few available methods. Studies will be carried out under UHV,
   electrochemical and catalytic conditions and during film growth and
   erosion. These studies will utilize X-ray grazing incidence
   diffraction, reflectivity, anomalous, diffraction, time resolved, and
   coherence techniques.
               An important research program of the CMC CAT will be to
   investigate the structure and phase behavior of complex macromolecular
   materials in their bulk phases. These areas include biomolecular
   materials, lyotropic, thermotropic, and polymeric liquid crystals,
   colloidal suspensions, block and graft copolymers and multilayer
   biomembrane systems. Besides studies under ambient conditions, these
   studies will be carried out at elevated pressures and temperatures, and
   under shear conditions. The high brilliance of the APS Undulator 'A'
   should permit kinetic studies of phase transitions in biomembranes and
   multiblock copolymers and the development of correlation spectroscopy
   techniques.
               The CMC membership has extensive experience in the
   characterization of new materials and the unique characteristics of the
   APS will be exploited to further these efforts. Materials of current
   interest include C60 compounds, superconducting oxides, metallic
   glasses, and conducting polymers. The topics of interest are constantly
   evolving and will expand to complement new discoveries in materials
   science.
               The facilities of the CMC CAT will significantly enhance
   the level of sophistication's. For instance, the high brilliance of the
   APS will make microdiffraction measurements of inhomogeneous materials
   and thin films possible, and will enable measurements of inelastic
   scattering.
