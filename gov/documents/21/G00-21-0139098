to Gas Metrology & Classical Methods
     __________________________________________________________________

Gas Metrology and Classical Methods Group conducts research in gas metrology
and classical analytical chemistry including: titrimetry, gravimetry, the
thermodynamic basis for pH, wet chemical and electroanalytical methods. The
group applies this research to the development and certification of Standard
Reference Materials for primary chemical reagents and the determination of
gaseous species and major elements in a broad spectrum of matrices; develops
and critically evaluates new techniques and provides standards for real-time
measurement of automotive emissions; establishes the infrastructure for the
establishment of NIST traceability for secondary reference materials;
maintains and develops pH and electrolytic conductivity standards and
techniques; provides advice and services to government agencies, scientific
organizations and American industry, and interacts with international
standards organizations.
