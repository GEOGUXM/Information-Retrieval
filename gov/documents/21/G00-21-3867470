                 History of the Committee on Indian Affairs
     __________________________________________________________________

   Summary. In 1977, the Senate re-established the Committee on Indian
   Affairs, making it a temporary Select Committee [February 4, 1977, S.
   Res. 4, ยง 105, 95th Congress., 1st Sess. (1977), as amended]. The
   Select Committee was to disband at the close of the 95th Congress, but
   following several term extensions, the Senate voted to make the
   Committee permanent on June 6, 1984. The Committee has jurisdiction to
   study the unique problems of American Indian, Native Hawaiian, and
   Alaska Native peoples and to propose legislation to alleviate these
   difficulties. These issues include, but are not limited to, Indian
   education, economic development, land management, trust
   responsibilities, health care, and claims against the United States.
   Additionally, all legislation proposed by Members of the Senate that
   specifically pertains to American Indians, Native Hawaiians, or Alaska
   Natives is under the jurisdiction of the Committee.

   History. Until 1946, when a legislative reorganization act abolished
   both the House and Senate Committees on Indian Affairs, the Senate
   Committee on Indian Affairs had been in existence since the early 19th
   century. After 1946, Indian affairs legislative and oversight
   jurisdiction was vested in subcommittees of the Interior and Insular
   Affairs Committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate.
   While this subcommittee arrangement may not have specifically reflected
   a diminishment of the consideration given Indian affairs by the
   Congress, the revised arrangement historically coincided with a 20-year
   hiatus in Indian affairs known as the "Termination Era" -- a period in
   which the prevailing policy of the United States was to terminate the
   Federal relationship with Indian tribes or transfer jurisdiction over
   tribal lands to the states.

   By the mid-1960's, this Termination philosophy was in decline as a
   failed policy and the Congress began to include Indian tribes in
   legislation designed to rebuild the social infrastructure of the Nation
   and provide economic opportunities for economically-depressed areas. In
   the early 1970's the Termination era was decisively ended with the
   enactment of the Menominee Restoration Act of 1973. Although a number
   of important legislative initiatives affecting Indians were enacted in
   the early 1970's, it became clear that the existing subcommittee
   structure was not providing an adequate forum for legislating
   appropriate solutions to problems confronting Indian country.
   Legislative jurisdiction over Indian affairs was fragmented among a
   number of committees. Overall, more than 10 committees in the Congress
   were responsible for Indian affairs, a situation which resulted in a
   sometimes disjointed treatment of Indian affairs and in an often
   haphazard development of Federal Indian policy.

   Re-Establishment of Committee. In 1973, Senator James Abourezk
   introduced Senate Joint Resolution No. 133 to establish a Federal
   commission to review all aspects of policy, law, and administration
   relating to affairs of the United States with American Indian tribes
   and people. The Senate and the House of Representatives both adopted
   S.J. Res. 133 and on January 2, 1975, the Resolution was signed into
   law by the President, thus establishing the American Indian Policy
   Review Commission [Public Law 93-580]. As the work of this Commission
   progressed, it became readily apparent that a full Senate committee
   with full legislative and oversight authority was needed to receive the
   report of the American Indian Policy Review Commission and to act upon
   its recommendations. Indeed, one of the final recommendations of the
   Commission was that a full-fledged Indian Affairs Committee be
   established in the Senate.

   At the same time the Commission was formulating its recommendation for
   the establishment of an Indian Affairs Committee, the Senate was
   developing a far-reaching proposal for reorganization of the entire
   Senate committee system. Under this proposal, the Subcommittee on
   Indian Affairs under the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs was
   to be abolished with its natural resource functions to be distributed
   among other newly formed Senate committees and its human resources
   functions to be transferred to the Senate Committee on Labor and Human
   Resources. In view of the pending report of the American Indian Policy
   Review Commission and its anticipated recommendations, however, the
   Senate revamped its committee reorganization proposal to include the
   establishment of a temporary select committee to receive the
   Commission's report and to act on its recommendations. Thus, there was
   included within Senate Resolution 4 of February 4, 1977, the Committee
   System Reorganization Amendments of 1977, a provision to establish a
   Select Committee on Indian Affairs with full jurisdiction over all
   proposed legislation and other matters relating to Indian affairs. With
   the commencement of the 96th Congress, the Select Committee on Indian
   Affairs was to expire and jurisdiction over Indian matters was to be
   transferred to the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources.

   As the Select Committee on Indian Affairs grappled with the report of
   the American Indian Policy Review Commission and the many other Indian
   issues that were presented to it during the 95th Congress, it became
   increasingly evident that if the Congress was to continue to meet its
   constitutional, legal, and historical responsibilities in the area of
   Indian affairs, an ongoing legislative committee with adequate
   expertise and resources should be re-established in the Senate.

   Senate Resolution 405, to make the Select Committee on Indian Affairs a
   permanent committee of the Senate, was introduced by Senator Abourezk
   on February 22, 1978. The measure was amended by the Rules Committee to
   extend the life of the committee for two years until January 2, 1981,
   and was agreed to by the Senate on October 14, 1978. In the 96th
   Congress, Senator John Melcher, who was at the time Chairman of the
   Select Committee, introduced S. Res. 448 to make it a permanent
   committee. The Resolution had 28 cosponsors, and was reported by the
   Rules Committee with an amendment to extend the select committee to
   January 2, 1984, and to expand the membership to seven members
   commencing in the 97th Congress. S. Res. 448 was adopted by the Senate
   on December 11, 1980.

   Permanent Committee. On April 28, 1983, Senator Mark Andrews, Chairman
   of the Select Committee on Indian Affairs in the 98th Congress,
   introduced S. Res. 127 to make the committee a permanent committee.
   This Resolution had 28 cosponsors. On November 1, 1983, the Committee
   on Rules and Administration voted unanimously to report the Resolution
   without amendment, and the Resolution was so reported on November 2,
   1983 (S. Rept. 98-294). On November 18, the last day of the first
   session of the 98th Congress, the Senate agreed to an extension of the
   select committee to July 1, 1984, in order to allow time for later
   debate. By the time the Resolution was brought to the floor for
   consideration there were 60 cosponsors. On June 4, 1984, the Select
   Committee on Indian Affairs was made a permanent committee of the
   Senate [S. Res. 127, 98th Congress, 2nd Sess.]. In 1993, the Select
   Committee on Indian Affairs was redesignated as the Committee on Indian
   Affairs [ยง 25, S. Res. 71, 103rd Cong., 1st Sess.].

   Number of Members. The number of members serving on the committee has
   expanded since its formation in 1977, revealing increasing interest
   among members of the Senate in Federal Indian policy. At the time the
   committee was formed in the 95th Congress, there were five members. The
   membership remained at five in the 96th Congress, but grew to seven in
   the 97th Congress and the 98th Congress. The membership increased to
   nine in the 99th Congress, and by the 101st Congress, the committee
   membership grew to 10. In the 102nd Congress the membership of the
   Committee expanded to 16 members. A further increase occurred in the
   beginning of the 103rd Congress when the membership was expanded to 18.
   In the 104th Congress, the Senate initially named 17 of its members to
   serve on the Committee, and elected Senator John McCain as Chairman and
   Senator Daniel K. Inouye as Vice-Chairman.

   After Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell joined the Republican party in
   1995, he was reappointed to the Committee, this time as a member of the
   majority. Consequently, the Committee membership was reduced to 16
   members as a result of Senator Paul Coverdell relinquishing membership
   on the Committee in order to maintain the appropriate ratio between
   majority and minority members (9 to 7 rather than 10 to 7).

   At the start of the 105th Congress, Senator Campbell was elected to
   serve as Chairman of and Senator Daniel K. Inouye as Vice-Chairman of
   the Committee. They were re-elected to their respective positions for
   the 106th Congress which began January, 1999.
