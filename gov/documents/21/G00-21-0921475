   Aerosols Group (AERO)

      Aerosol measurements began at the CMDL baseline observatories in the
      mid-1970's as part of the Geophysical Monitoring for Climate Change
      (GMCC) program. Since the inception of the program, scientific
      understanding of the behavior of atmospheric aerosols has improved
      considerably. One lesson learned is that human activities primarily
      influence aerosols on regional/continental scales rather than global
      scales. The goals of this regional-scale monitoring program are to
      characterize means, variability, and trends of climate-forcing
      properties of different types of aerosols, and to understand the
      factors that control these properties. CMDL's measurements also provide
      ground-truth for satellite measurements and global models, as well as
      key aerosol parameters for global-scale models.


    Quality Control Plots - Data from the aerosol monitoring stations are
    updated daily. Web plots of raw measurement and instrument monitoring
         data allow CMDL staff to review current station operations.
    Research - CMDL's measurements of aerosol optical properties provide
     information about the trends and factors that influence the climate
   forcing effect of aerosol particles. The study of aerosol properties on
   various spatial and temporal scales yields information about trends in
     aerosol distributions. Other factors such as relative humidity and
     aerosol chemistry also determine the role aerosols play in climate
     forcing. Presentations and publications provide an in depth look at
                            some of these issues.
     Instruments and Measurements - In situ measurements of a variety of
   aerosol optical properties are made at CMDL's aerosol monitoring sites.
         The measurement suite enables calculation of direct aerosol
      climateforcing. The measured values relevant for climate forcing
          calculations are: light absorption, total scattering and
       backscattering. These measurements are used toderive parameters
                    required in the forcing calculation.
     Stations - Baseline and regional stations provide information about
   long-term changes in background aerosol properties and the influence of
    regional sources on aerosol optical properties statistics and trends.
      In addition to long-term monitoring at the baseline and regional
   stations, the aerosol group participates in short term field campaigns
    to study specific regional issues. Two recent field experiments were
                            INDOEX and ACE-Asia.
