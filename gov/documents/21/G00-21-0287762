   National Program

                   back arrow forward arrow
      The mission of NOAA's National Marine Sanctuary Program is to serve as
      the trustee for the nation's system of marine protected areas, to
      conserve, protect, and enhance their biodiversity, ecological integrity
      and cultural legacy. Its goals are appropriate to the unique diversity
      contained within individuals sites. They may include restoring and
      rebuilding marine habitats or ecosystems to their natural condition or
      monitoring and maintaining already healthy areas. One sanctuary may
      protect the breeding ground of humpback whales while another houses the
      remains of historical shipwrecks. Yet all share in common a growing
      circle of partners and volunteers who embrace the program's ocean
      ethic--to preserve and protect and respect our nation's marine
      environment.

      Within these National Program pages, you will find useful information
      about our history: how we've changed over time, the steps taken in
      designating a marine protected area, and the legislation that helped to
      create our marine sanctuaries.

      A Landscape of Promise

      The American continent offered a landscape of promise to early settlers
      who viewed the vast expanse of forest and rich diversity of wildlife
      and plants as inexhaustible resources. After two centuries, the land
      mirrored the impact of the millions of new arrivals to our
      shores--forests were felled, wetlands drained and certain species of
      marine mammals and seabirds became extinct.

      Fortunately for the American people, President Theodore Roosevelt
      visited Yellowstone National Park, established in l872 as the nation's
      first national park, and resolved to prevent further destruction. After
      the visit to a land he described as "magnificent beyond imaging" in
      1905, he created the Forest Service. Eleven years later, President
      Wilson signed an Act that created the National Park Service. Through
      the work of these two agencies, public lands are preserved for the
      enjoyment of future generations. Today national parks --land
      sanctuaries--protect habitat and wildlife inhabitants in 378 areas of
      the country covering more than 83.3 million acres.

      Sanctuaries for the Sea

      Until 1969 when a devastating oil spill blackened the coastline of
      southern California and killed countless marine creatures, the ocean's
      size and changing tides seemed safe from any lasting human damage.
      Three years later, Congress responded to the oil spill and other
      accounts of toxic dumping with a series of new environmental laws to
      prevent ocean dumping and protect endangered marine animals. Like the
      national parks, marine areas identified for their biodiversity,
      ecological integrity, and cultural legacy could now receive protection
      through the National Marine Sanctuary Program. The program,
      administered by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
      was created in Title III of the Marine Protection, Research and
      Sanctuaries Act of 1972.

      Twenty-five years later the national marine sanctuaries are found in
      the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and off the coast of American Samoa.

      They include breeding and feeding grounds of whales, sea lions, sharks,
      and sea turtles; significant coral reefs and kelp forest habitats; and
      the remains of the U.S. Monitor, a Civil War ironclad sunk off the
      coast of North Carolina.

      Today twelve national marine sanctuaries protect some 18,000 square
      miles of ocean and coasts. A thirteenth marine sanctuary, the first on
      the Great Lakes in Thunder Bay, Michigan, is scheduled for designation
      in fall of 1999.

      A National System of Marine Sanctuaries

      One hundred years ago few people understood the significance of
      conserving the forests they shared. We know better today. Over a
      hundred years later, still too few people understand the impact that a
      healthy thriving ocean has on our everyday life--its effect on the
      climate, its significance as a source of food and commerce, the
      importance of its marine life in the ecosystem, and its potential for
      medical cures.


                                              Coastal development

   Our coastlines are under increasing pressure from development.

      Our very existence on the planet is dependent on preserving our oceans.
      Today our coastal areas are subject to great environmental pressures.
      Over 50% of our nation's people live within 50 miles of the ocean or
      Great Lakes. This migration to our coastlines for home, livelihood or
      recreation is predicted to increase by the year 2010. With this comes
      the inevitable loss of marine habitats and increased pollution
      multiplying additional stresses on threatened ocean resources.

      The importance of maintaining a system of marine protected areas is
      evident. Today our national marine sanctuaries are helping to explore
      this last frontier and increasing our knowledge and understanding of
      complex marine ecosystems. NOAA's sanctuaries help monitor both human
      and natural changes in the environment that can help prevent further
      harmful impacts. Our sanctuaries link coastal communities together
      enabling marine advocates on both oceans to learn betters ways to
      preserve our marine environments. Recent surveys of human impact on
      coral reefs off Florida and the Gulf of Mexico benefit the national and
      international scientific communities. And through education, the
      national marine sanctuaries help others to a greater appreciation of
      the ocean world and to become better stewards.

      The National Marine Sanctuary Program expands our nation's long history
      of protecting special areas on land to embrace the seas. It brings a
      ecosystem approach to marine environmental protection and asks us to
      adopt a new ethic of marine stewardship, but perhaps most of all, it
      challenges us all to work together to find creative solutions to the
      problems facing our oceans and coasts.

      In 1948, conservationist Aldo Leopold defined "a land ethic" this way:
      "When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to
      use it with love and respect." The National Marine Sanctuaries Program
      asks us to translate that ethic from land to ocean. Join with us in
      protecting our ocean resources, "magnificent beyond imagining."
