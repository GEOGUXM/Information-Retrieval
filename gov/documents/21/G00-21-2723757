   Membranes are used increasingly in separation processes, novel
   synthesis processes, and as process sensors. To add to the science and
   engineering base of membrane technology, NIST scientists are working on
   the following objectives:
     * To develop improved quantitative structure/property prediction
       methods for polymeric membrane materials based on high quality
       measurements of sorption and transport of gases and vapors in
       several well-characterized systems and to compile property data on
       industrially-significant materials used for membrane-based
       separations.
     * To develop improved quantitative characterization techniques and
       predictive models for the filtration of complex mixtures using
       commercial membranes based on high quality measurements of
       streaming potential and water transport coefficients and detailed
       measurements of filtration results on dilute, complex aqueous
       mixtures encountered in membrane-based separations.
