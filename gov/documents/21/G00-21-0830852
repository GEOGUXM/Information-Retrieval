    S

       An OSEI "Standard"-format image saved at full resolution and at high
       image quality. Resultant file sizes are generally at or above 500K and
       sometimes exceed 1M. Dimensions vary by image but are generally at
       least 1024X1024.

    P

       An OSEI "Preview"-format image is reduced dimensionally before saving.
       These files function as thumbnails that allow the user to determine
       their interest in an event before downloading the standard version of
       the product. File sizes are generally around 60K.

    M

        OSEI AVI-format animations whose file sizes depend on the length and
        dimensions of the loop. File sizes exceeding 1M are common.
