   The Indian Health Service is the U.S. Public Health Service Agency
   responsible for addressing the comprehensive health needs of over one
   million American Indians and Alaska Natives. This task is complicated
   by the broad cultural, economic and geographic diversity of the groups
   served. As a result, health programs must be individually designed to
   address the needs of each community.

   Presently, IHS and tribally managed dental programs operate in over 230
   hospitals and clinics in 33 states. Dental programs strive to prevent
   as much dental disease as possible through organized prevention
   programs and to limit existing disease through active clinical
   programs.

   As in the U.S. population, dental caries and the periodontal diseases
   are common in Native Americans: however, both the prevalence and the
   backlog of untreated disease are much higher. There are also special
   concerns regarding caries in young children as well as periodontal
   disease in adolescents and diabetics.

   The IHS encourages the pursuit of strategies designed to support
   healthy life-styles and habits that will result hopefully in the long
   term reduction of dental disease.
