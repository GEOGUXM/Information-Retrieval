   the Gamma-Ray Tracking System being developed at Lawrence Berkeley Labs
     __________________________________________________________________

   At the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory we are developing a new technique
   to allow the tracking of gamma-radiation in matter. Tracking implies
   the determination of the time sequence of interactions of gamma-rays
   and their respective positions and energies. It therefore enables the
   localization and characterization of gamma-radiating sources. The
   development also will increase the sensitivity (like efficiency and
   signal-to-background ratio) in detecting gamma-radiation compared to
   already existing instruments. The realization of gamma-ray tracking has
   a large potential impact in basic as well as applied sciences,
   medicine, national safety and health.
