   Wetland loss along the Louisiana coastal zone has long been recognized
   as one of the states most pressing environmental problems. Of the
   numerous factors contributing to this loss, perhaps the leveeing of the
   Mississippi River for flood control has had the most far-reaching
   impact, blocking the rivers historic spring overflows and thus impeding
   the rush of marsh-supporting fresh water, nutrients and sediment to the
   coastal zone.

   The Davis Pond Freshwater Diversion Structure will imitate historic
   spring floods, providing a controlled flow of fresh water and nutrients
   from the Mississippi River into a target area in the Barataria Bay
   estuary. Located on the west bank of St. Charles Parish, two miles
   below Luling, Davis Pond is expected to restore former ecological
   conditions by combatting land loss, enhancing vegetation and improving
   fish and wildlife habitat.

   Bank of St. Charles Parish.

   This will be accomplished with four iron-gated 14' x 14' box culverts
   built into the Mississippi River levee. An inflow channel 535' long x
   85' wide will direct river water into the structure, while an outflow
   channel more than 11,000' long x 120' wide will extend behind the
   structure into the ponding area and, ultimately, into the estuary. The
   total project area comprises 10,084 acres, including the 9,200-acre
   ponding area.

   When completed, Davis Pond will be able to divert up to 10,650 cubic
   feet per second (cfs) of fresh water. Diversions through the structure
   will occur under regulated conditions determined by monitoring basin
   salinities and fish and wildlife resources.

   During the next 50 years, Davis Pond will preserve about 33,000 acres
   of marsh and benefit 777,000 acres of marshes and bays. These shallow
   areas support a bountiful oyster crop each year, and they provide
   important nursery habitat for shrimp and fish. Similarly, the marsh
   provides food and nesting habitat for fur-bearing animals and migratory
   waterfowl. By improving existing marsh conditions, the project is
   expected to provide average annual benefits of $15 million for fish and
   wildlife, plus $300,000 for recreation.

   Davis Pond is a feature of the Mississippi Delta Region Project, and
   was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1965 and the Water Resources
   Development Acts of 1974, 1986 and 1996. The total estimated cost of
   the project is $105 million, with the federal government paying $77.8
   million and the state paying $27.2 million. To expedite the project,
   Louisiana volunteered to contribute 25% toward the project; the Project
   Cooperation Agreement between the state and the federal government was
   signed in April 1993. Construction began in January 1997.

   Six primary construction contracts are associated with this project.
   Five contracts have been awarded to date for the pumping station (C.R.
   Pittman Construction), the Highway 90 Bridge (River Road Construction),
   the structure itself (Maharrey-Houston Construction), the east guide
   levee and weir (Weeks Marine, Inc.) and the west guide levee (J.
   Caldarera & Company, Inc.). The remaining contract is for the
   Burlington Northern Railroad Bridge. The project should be diverting
   flows into the Barataria Basin in the year 2000.

   Senator Breaux hailed the project as a new beginning and commended
   those who are committed to restoring the coast of Louisiana. Once you
   lose the very essence of your state and territory, it never comes back,
   he said. Were restoring to the Mississippi River its ability to flood.
   But we will control that flooding in a positive sense to rebuild our
   state.

   In addition to Davis Pond, two other structures, one completed and one
   proposed, are important to the future of Louisiana's coast. The
   Caernarvon Freshwater Diversion Structure, 15 miles below New Orleans,
   was completed in February 1991 at a cost of $25.9 million. Since it
   began operating, new land and marsh vegetation have appeared and oyster
   production on the public grounds has more than tripled. During the next
   50 years, Caernarvon is expected to re-establish favorable salinity
   conditions in the area, further enhancing fish and wildlife
   productivity.

   The proposed Bonnet Carre Freshwater Diversion Structure would be
   located on the east bank of the river, within the Bonnet Carre
   Spillway. It is designed to divert flows up to 25,000 cfs into the Lake
   Pontchartrain Basin and western Mississippi Sound. This would reduce
   saltwater intrusion and result in a healthier marsh and increased
   production of oysters, shrimp, crabs and fish. Construction of this $87
   million project has not been scheduled.
