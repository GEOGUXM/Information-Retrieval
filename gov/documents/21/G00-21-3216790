                                 Operation Raincheck

       Fort Worth Center is proud to offer Operation Raincheck to the flying
   community. Raincheck is a program geared to pilots of all skill levels,
   from the student pilot to the most senior commercial pilot. The
   Raincheck presentation is a multi-media, hands on, interactive
   concept. Fort Worth center blends informative updated aviation related
   topics with actual radar time familiarization. Also as part of the
   Raincheck experience, participants get their shot at setting up a
   stream of arrivals for approach control in our simulation lab.  For any
   additional information or class scheduling contact Gary Hebsacker at
   (817) 858-7724
