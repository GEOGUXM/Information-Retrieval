                 Tip:
     Search For: ___________________________________ in
                 [All of SSA__________] GO
           Mode: (*) Concept ( ) Boolean ( ) Pattern

     * For all searches: Enclose exact phrases in double quotes. For
       example, "change of address" will result in documents about
       changing your address in Social Security records, while change of
       address will result in a list of every document that has the words
       change or address in it.
     * Concept mode searches are performed on meaning instead of exact
       matches to your query words.  Query terms are expanded to other
       related terms.  For example a search on the word "money" may also
       locate the similar concepts of "cash" and "dollar".
     * Boolean mode searches look up documents with (or without) a
       specific term or terms.  Boolean queries can use the standard
       operators AND, OR, NOT, BUT, and WITHIN.  Boolean queries are best
       at retrieving proper nouns, and words or phrases you know are in
       the database.
     * Pattern mode searches for patterns that match your query.  This is
       useful in situations where you have words with various or difficult
       spellings.
