   The LoBoS Supercomputers are an implementation of Beowulf-class
   supercomputing in the Computational Biophysics Section at the National
   Institutes of Health. LoBoS, which stands for Lots of Boxes on Shelves,
   is an ensemble of PCs connected with high speed networks to achieve
   supercomputer performance at a substantial savings. The strategy is to
   build a supercomputer using lots of commodity-priced processors instead
   of fewer expensive "supercomputer" processors to achieve a reduction in
   the overall price of computation by a factor of 10 or more. The current
   configuration allows scientists within the collaborating laboratories
   to study more complex biological systems using computational methods.
   The LoBoS business model is to purchase the fastest commodity
   processors available, use them for 18 to 24 months, and then migrate
   them to the desktop.
