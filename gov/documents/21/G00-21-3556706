CAP CELEBRATES ITS 60TH ANNIVERSARY

   On Dec. 1, 2001, Civil Air Patrol will mark its 60th year of
   humanitarian service. Already plans are drafted to celebrate this
   special milestone in Civil Air Patrol's history. Reflecting on Civil
   Air Patrols beginnings in 1941 is extremely relevant as we mark the
   beginnings of the new millennium. The roots of this all-volunteer
   organization are grounded deep into the nations history.
   As early as 1938, momentum began to build for the creation of an
   organization to harness civilian aviation resources to aid the nation
   in the event America entered the conflict. These efforts, led by
   writer-aviator Gill Robb Wilson and supported by Gen. Henry "Hap"
   Arnold, resulted in the creation of the Civil Air Patrol on Dec. 1,
   1941  one week before Pearl Harbor.
   These Flying Minutemen performed many missions including coastal
   patrol to search for enemy submarines, search and rescue missions
   throughout the United States, cargo and courier flights to transfer
   critical materials and personnel, and even towing targets so Army Air
   Corps personnel could practice air-to-air gunnery techniques - a very
   risky mission with new gunners.
   In all, these volunteers amassed a stunning record flying more than
   half-a-million hours, sinking two enemy submarines, and saving hundreds
   of crash victims.
