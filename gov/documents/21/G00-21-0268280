   X-Ray Data Booklet Section 5.5 USEFUL EQUATIONS The following pages
   include a number of equations useful to x-ray scientists, either
   expanding on subjects covered in this booklet or addressing topics not
   covered here. The equations have been drawn from D. T. Attwood, Soft
   X-Rays and Extreme Ultraviolet Radiation: Principles and Applications
   (Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, 1999) [http://www.coe.
   berkeley.edu/AST/sxreuv], and the equation numbers refer to that
   volume, which should be consulted for further explanation and
   discussion. That reference also expands on the discussions in this
   booklet on zone plate optics, synchrotron radiation, and other topics.
