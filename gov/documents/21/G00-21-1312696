   F.Y.I.
                                 F.Y.I. Text

   A variety of investigative areas

   Crime today is as varied in scope as ever, ranging from simple acts of
   deceit to full-scale illegal organized networks. The FBI is keeping up
   with all areas of unlawful practices, taking its responsibility very
   seriously to protect the public from any kind of harm. The Bureau deals
   with traditional crimes such as bank robbery, fugitives, and drug
   interdiction, as well as new technology crimes like intellectual
   property theft and Internet child pornography. The FBI is also our
   country's primary domestic and international counterterrorism
   organization. Below is a sampling of the programs in which the Salt
