                          Ground-Based Observations

   Between balloon and aircraft campaigns the MkIV instrument is used to
   make ground-based observations. Although these measurements lack the
   vertical resolution that is attainable from balloon platforms,
   ground-based observations can nevertheless be made much more frequently
   - MkIV has averaged over 50 days of observation per year over the past
   several years. Ground-based observations are an accurate method of
   ascertaining whether the composition of the Earth's stratosphere is
   changing.

                            Instrument Description:

   The MkIV interferometer is a high resolution FTIR spectrometer designed
   and built at JPL in the early 1980's for solar absorption measurements.
   The MkIV employes a double-passed optical configuration for compactness
   and to provide passive shear compensation. Two parallel detectors, an
   HgCdTe photoconductor covering 650-1950 cm^-1 and an InSb photodiode
   covering 1850-5650 cm^-1, allow the entire mid-infrared spectrum to be
   measured simultaneously. For ground-based observations an optical path
   difference of 117 cm is usually employed, which takes about 3 minutes
   per scan sampling every fringe of a .633 um He:Ne laser at 10kHz.

                             Algorithm Description:

   Column abundances were derived using the GFIT algorithm, developed at
   JPL for the analysis of solar absorption spectra. Initial vertical
   profiles were based on balloon measurements, which were then stretched
   or squashed until the measured HF absorption was matched. These
   profiles were then scaled in order to derive the vertical column
   abundances. The HITRAN_96 linelist was used for the analyses,
   complemented by the pseudolines for the gases CCl[4], CFC-11, CFC-12,
   CF[4], SF[6], ClNO[3], and HCFC-22.

                  Expected Precision/Accuracy of Measurements:

   The precision of these column abundances were determined from the
   quality of the spectral fits by the GFIT algorithm and are included in
   the exchange file for each measurement of each gas. Accuracies are more
   difficult to determine.

   Barcroft (October) for ground-based observations. For each balloon
   flight we also performed many days of ground-based observation while
   waiting for good launch conditions. This explains the large number of
   different sites from which the MkIV instrument has made measurements.
