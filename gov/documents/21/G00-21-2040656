   What is ISDN?

   Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
   For the 1990s and beyond, an advanced technology known as Integrated
   Services Digital Network (ISDN) promises to revolutionize the
   telecommunications industry worldwide. This technology offers immense
   potential benefits to government, industry, and personal users with its
   ability to exchange voice, data, and image information concurrently
   over telephone lines. With ISDN, computer and communication
   technologies converge to speed and simplify the flow of information
   between sender and receiver.

   Before the full potential of ISDN can be realized, however, government
   and industry must collaborate to overcome barriers to the widespread
   acceptance and use of ISDN technology.

   The Major Roadblock
   Pinpointing the barriers to the widespread use of ISDN in both the
   national and international arenas has been difficult because the
   technology is complex and developing rapidly. One underlying problem
   which has been addressed was the lack of standard implementations of
   ISDN applications.

   ISDN standards are currently developed by the International
   Telecommunications Union- Telecommunications (ITU-T) (formerly the
   International Telephone and Telegraph Consultative Committee [CCITT])
   and by accredited standards committee T1 under the umbrella of the
   American National Standards Institute (ANSI). But standards designed to
   meet many requirements offer multiple options which are open to diverse
   interpretations. As a result, services and products produced by
   different manufacturers are incompatible.

   The last NIUF meeting was held June 1999 in Montreal, Canada. NIST and
       other NIUF members have agreed that NIUF has successfully
       accomplished its purposes and goals for which it was created. ISDN
       has become a mature technology which is widely deployed (with sales
       of ISDN lines still increasing), and has wide availability of ISDN
       products in retail stores.
       National ISDN issues and enhancements are still being reviewed
       through the National ISDN Council (www.nationalisdncouncil.com).

                              What is the NIUF

   NIST collaborated with industry in 1988 to establish the North American
   ISDN Users' Forum (NIUF). A Cooperative Research and Development
   Agreement (CRADA) with industry was established in 1991 to govern the
   management of the forum. NIST's Information Technology Laboratory (ITL)
   serves as chair of the forum and hosts the NIUF Secretariat. Through
   support of the forum, ITL advances new uses of computer and
   telecommunications technology in government and industry.

   The purpose of the NIUF is to create a strong user voice in the
   implementation of ISDN applications. The NIUF provides users of ISDN
   technology with the opportunity to work with implementors to assure
   that users' needs are met in the ISDN design process. Through the NIUF,
   users and manufacturers concur on ISDN applications, the selection of
   options from standards, and conformance tests, enhancing the strength
   of the U.S. telecommunications industry in the world marketplace.

   Objectives of the NIUF
     * To provide users the opportunity to influence developing ISDN
       technology to reflect their needs;
     * To identify ISDN applications, develop implementation requirements,
       and facilitate their timely, harmonized, and interoperable
       introduction; and
     * To solicit user, product provider, and service provider
       participation in the process.

                       What the NIUF has Accomplished

   Since its inception in 1988 through June 1999, the NIUF has met 36
   times with the following results:
     * 153 active applications for development of Application Profiles
       have been accepted;
     * Application Profiles have been completed for 13 applications;
     * 14 Implementation Agreements have been completed; and
     * 12 Conformance Tests have been completed.
     * Participation in the Transcontinental ISDN Project '92 (TRIP '92)
       earned the NIUF and Corporation for Open Systems International
       (COS) the InfoWorld Publisher's Industry Milestone Award for 1992
       Product of the Year.
