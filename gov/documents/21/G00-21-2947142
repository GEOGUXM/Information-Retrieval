   The U.S. Geological Survey distributes proficiency samples to more than
   150 USGS offices for a total of about 6,500 samples each year through
   the National Field Quality Assurance Program (NFQA). About 100,000
   proficiency samples have been analyzed during the life of the program.
   Each field analyst receives from 1 to 3 samples for pH, specific
   conductance, and alkalinity. The NFQA manager attempts to send
   proficiency samples that are similar in analyte concentrations normally
   determined by the analyst during the analyst's normal duties. The
   results from the program have been summarized in six bar charts for the
   analytes--pH(1979-1989) and (1990-1997), specific
   conductance(1979-1989) and (1990-1997), and alkalinity(1985-1989) and
   (1990-1997). The "fourth-spread statistic" displayed on the y-axis of
   each graph represents the data range of the middle 50 percent of the
   values determined during each comparison.
