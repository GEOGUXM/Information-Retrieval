   SFBAY1.jpg (17144 bytes) The Physical Oceanographic Real Time System
   (PORTS) is designed to provide crucial information in real time to
   mariners, oil spill response teams, managers of coastal resources, and
   others about San Francisco Bays water levels, currents, salinity, and
   winds. In partnership with the NOAAs National Ocean Service (NOS); the
   California Office of Oil Spill Preparedness and Response (OSPR), the
   U.S. Geological Survey, and the local community, the Marine Exchange of
   the San Francisco Bay operates PORTS as a service to those who must
   make operational decisions based on oceanographic and meteorological
   conditions in the Bay.

   The number, type, and mix of instruments that collect this information
   are deployed at strategic locations (figure 1) in the Bay both to
   provide data at critical locations and to allow nowcasting and
   forecasting using a mathematical model of the Bays oceanographic
   processes. Data from these sensors is fed to a central data collection
   point; raw data from the sensors are integrated and synthesized into
   information and analysis products, including graphical displays of
   PORTS data. These displays will be available in the next few weeks over
   the Internet. PORTS data are also available through a voice response
   system.

   The San Francisco Bay PORTS instrumentation consists of Acoustic
   Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs), tide gauges,
   conductivity-temperature sensors (CTs) and meteorological packages.
   Leased, dedicated phone lines and radio modems connect the sensors to
   the central data collection computers, which record the data every six
   minutes. High speed leased lines (56Kbps) connect the data collection
   computers to the data processing and distribution hub. The primary
   access to the hub and PORTS data and related products will soon be
   through a T-1 connection to the Internet. The centralized data
   acquisition system is installed at the California Maritime Academy in
   Vallejo.

   ship1.jpg (40130 bytes) PORTS is now in an operational demonstration
   phase that will extend over the next two years. During that time,
   various improvements to the information systems will be made in
   response to user feedback and the overall system will be evaluated for
   reliability and value to the Bay Area community. A prototype
   information hub will be available by the first two weeks in November
   1997; a capability to predict currents and other refinements to an
   oceanographic model for the Bay will be complete by January 1998, and a
   fully operational hub will be in place by March 1998. Besides access to
   both historical and real time data, information hub displays will
   offer, surface current predictions, graphics showing real time vs.
   predicted water levels, and real time surface winds.

   The PORTS system can be expanded to accommodate additional sensors from
   private industry or other agencies. Sensors such as current meters to
   aid in navigation approaches to oil terminals or commercial ports or
   salinity sensors to monitor salinity changes in wetlands habitats and
   the Delta region could be made available to the public along with
   existing PORTS data.
