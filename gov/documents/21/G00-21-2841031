   area almost doubled from about 1.5 million people in 1970 to 2.9
   million people in 1995 (Atlanta Regional Commission, written commun.,
   2000). Residential, commercial, and other urban land uses more than
   tripled during the same period (Frick and others, 1998). The

   when there is a known or suspected outbreak of a water- borne disease.
   However, it is cost prohibitive, and in some cases technically imprac-
   tical, to routinely monitor for all disease-causing bacteria, viruses,
   and protozoa that may be found in contaminated surface water. For
   routine water-quality monitoring, harmless bacteria that occur in

   Chattahoochee River only frontage and park unit as the disease-causing
   bacteria are typically measured. The fecal-coliform bacteria group has
   long been the preferred indicator bacteria for Federal and State
   regulatory agencies and until 1986, was the primary indicator bacteria
   for which Federal and State regulations were based. Recent advances in
   the use of indicator bacteria have shown that Escherichia coli (E.
   coli) and Enterococci are more reliable for predicting the presence of
   disease-causing organisms and are now recommended for use in monitoring
   programs by the USEPA. Although the presence of indicator bacteria does
   not prove that pathogenic bacteria are present in the environment, the
   presence does show that contamination by fecal material has occurred.
