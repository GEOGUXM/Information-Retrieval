                                      Community Alert & Education

                                      The Community Alert & Education section consists of periodic features
   designed to educate the public on the FBI's multiple investigative
   responsibilities and help you learn how to protect yourself and your
   family from criminal activities the FBI and law enforcement encounter
   in our community.  When a new feature is added, the old feature will be
   placed in archives, along with other former features, for your future
   reference.  Previous features can be reviewed through the  Previous
   Alerts  link below. We will also use this section in the event it is
   necessary to provide any alerts which are time sensitive and important
   to disseminate to the public.  We continue to urge anyone reviewing our
   web page to provide us e-mail  which you believe will be appropriate
   for us to review.  If you would like to request a particular topic for
   our Community Alert and Education section, you may also e-mail  us.
