   NPOESS Preparatory Project

      The NPP is a bridge between the NASA EOS program and NPOESS. It is a
      joint NASA/IPO instrument risk reduction project for the following
      sensors under development:
        * VIIRS NPP logo
        * CrIS
        * ATMS

      Its mission is to demonstrate advanced technology for atmospheric
      sounding, giving continuing observations about global change after
      EOS-AM (Terra) and EOS-PM (Aqua). It supplies data on atmospheric and
      sea surface temperatures, humidity soundings, land and ocean biological
      productivity, and cloud and aerosol properties.

      NPP contributes
        * instrument risk reduction, offering early instrument and system
          level testing
        * lessons learned for design modifications in time to ensure NPOESS
          launch readiness
        * ground system risk reduction
        * early user evaluation of NPOESS data products, such as algorithms
          and instrument verification, opportunities for instrument
          calibration.
