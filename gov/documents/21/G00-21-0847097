   All documents listed above are for information purposes only, and may
   not represent final positions on any matter respecting the future
   NPOESS EMD/Production acquisition. In the interest of market research
   and industry participation, it is deemed desirable to release
   information to industry sooner rather than later, and industry input is
   invited, but this early posting in no way precludes the Government from
   changing its approach as time passes. Industry input on information
   posted here is invited -- John Inman, Contracting Officer, NPOESS
