   Below Normal Rainfall and Warm Temperatures Lead to Record Low Water
   Levels in December

   Three months of above normal temperatures and four months of below
   normal rainfall have led to record low monthly streamflow and
   ground-water levels, according to hydrologists at the U.S. Geological
   Survey (USGS) in Baltimore, Maryland. Streamflow was below normal at 94
   percent of the real-time USGS gaging stations and 83 percent of the
   USGS observation wells across Maryland and Delaware in December.

   Record low streamflow levels for December were set at Winters Run and
   Pocomoke River. Streamflow levels at Deer Creek and Winters Run in
   Harford County have frequently set new record daily lows for the last
   four months (see real-time graphs at
   http://md.water.usgs.gov/realtime/). Streamflow was also significantly
   below normal at Antietam Creek, Choptank River, Conococheague Creek,
   Nassawango Creek, Patapsco River, Gunpowder River, Patuxent River,
   Piscataway Creek, Monocacy River, and Potomac River in Maryland, and
   Christina River, St. Jones River, and White Clay Creek in Delaware. The
   monthly streamflow in the Potomac River near Washington, D.C. was 82
   percent below normal in December and 54 percent below normal for 2001.

   Streamflow entering the Chesapeake Bay averaged 23.7 bgd (billion
   gallons per day), which is 54 percent below the long-term average for
   December. Much of the flow was from the Susquehanna River, which
   provided 68 percent, compared to its long-term average of 50 percent.
   Streamflow into the Bay for 2001 was 36 percent below average.
   Streamflow has been below average since last January, except during
   April (see graphs at http://md.water.usgs.gov/monthly/bay.html).

   Record low ground-water levels for December were set at seven
   water-table observation wells in Harford, Howard, Somerset, Washington,
   Wicomico, and Worcester Counties in Maryland, and New Castle County in
   Delaware (see graphs at http://md.water.usgs.gov/groundwater/).
   Ground-water levels were also significantly below normal in Allegany,
   Baltimore, Carroll, Charles, Frederick, Montgomery, and Queen Annes
   Counties in Maryland, and Kent County in Delaware.

   Storage in the Baltimore Reservoir system decreased to 62 percent of
   capacity in December. Rainfall has been below normal since September
   across Maryland and Delaware. In northern central Maryland, rainfall
   was more than 10 inches below normal in 2001, according to the Middle
   Atlantic River Forecast Center. Above normal rain or snow is still
   needed to replenish the low streamflow and ground-water levels in order
   to avoid drought conditions next spring and summer.

   As the Nation's largest water, earth and biological science, and
   civilian mapping agency, the USGS works in cooperation with more than
   2,000 organizations across the country to provide reliable, impartial
   scientific information to resource managers, planners, and other
   customers. This information is gathered in every state by USGS
   scientists to minimize the loss of life and property from natural
   disasters, contribute to the sound conservation and the economic and
   physical development of the nation's natural resources, and enhance the
   quality of life by monitoring water, biological, energy, and mineral
   resources.
