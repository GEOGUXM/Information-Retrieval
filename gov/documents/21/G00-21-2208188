   Radars, Radiometers, and Radar Processors
   The NOAA/ETL Radar Meteorology and Oceanography Division designs and
   operates high- performance, transportable, Doppler radars for
   atmospheric and oceanic research. These radars use higher frequencies
   (shorter wavelengths) and are smaller than storm surveillance radars.
   Our radars have been used extensively in field research projects at
   dozens of locations in the United States and other countries. The
   radars were designed and built in-house and are in a continuous state
   of development as latest state-of-the-art capabilities are added. The
   Ka-band "cloud" radars have superb sensitivity that allows them to
   detect tiny cloud particles in addition to precipitation. In
   combination with radiometers, these cloud radars are used to estimate
   microphysical features of the nearby clouds, including ice crystal and
   water droplet sizes and mass contents. Polarization measurements from
   the scanning cloud radar allow the particle shapes and types (plate
   crystals, column crystals, droplets, etc.) to be identified in the
   clouds. Polarization capabilities recently implemented in the scanning
   X-band "hydro-radar" allow new possibilities for more accurate
   estimation of rainfall and snowfall rates. Both scanning radars have
   also been used for studies of the ocean surface and both are equipped
   with the new RADS processor that was designed at ETL.

  NOAA/D

   NOAA/D 9.3-GHz Atmosphere & Ocean Radar. ETL developed this
   state-of-the-art X-band radar primarily for observations of the ocean
   surface, rain, snow, storm airflow patterns, and for hydrological
   applications. It has Doppler, dual- polarization, and full scanning
   capability, including the ability to scan downward beneath the horizon
   for ocean work. Fine-scale measurements are possible with selectable
   range resolution from 7.5 to 150 meters. Polarization options include
   switching between H and V, or using the "split" H/V, configuration that
   has been proposed for future NEXRAD upgrades. The polarization
   measurements include differential phase (Kdp), and differential
   reflectivity (ZDR), which can used for more accurate estimates of
   rainfall rate and identification of precipitation particle types. The
   radar uses ETL's new Radar Acquisition and Display System (RADS), which
   allows various options for scan control and computing derived
   parameters in realtime. The radar is transportable in North America on
   its own trailer bed or it can be shipped overseas in standard sea
   containers. ETL engineers are working toward implementing fully
   automated, unattended operation and remote control of this system. See
   three-page article for further details. Photo of NOAA/D radar.

  NOAA/K

   Photo of NOAA/K radar. NOAA/K 34.6-GHz cloud-sensing radar -ETL has
   developed a K[a]-band (8.7-mm wavelength) system designed primarily for
   observations of non-precipitating and weakly precipitating clouds. By
   virtue of its short wavelength, it has excellent sensitivity to very
   small hydrometeors and is insensitive to ground clutter. The radar has
   been used extensively for research of the radiative effects of clouds
   for climate change programs and for observations of winter storms. A
   rotating quarter-wave plate allows transmission of a continuous
   sequence of polarizations from circular to elliptical to linear to
   examine hydrometeor types. The radar transmits 85-kW of peak power in a
   0.5-degree conical beam width using a 1-m parabolic antenna with an
   offset Cassegrain feed. Radial velocity, reflectivity, and
   depolarization are measured at 256 gates with 37.5m resolution using
   PPI and RHI or fixed beam scans. Sensitivity is about -30 dBZ at 10-km
   range.

   In another configuration H,V, or slant-linear dual-polarization is
   available with a 1.8 meter antenna for even greater sensitivity. The
   radar uses ETL's new Radar Acquisition and Display (RADS) system.

   See three-page article for further details.

  Millimeter-Wave Cloud Radar (MMCR)

   [mmcr.et6.gif] This is a 35-GHz (K[a]-band) cloud profiling radar
   designed by ETL for unattended, long-term cloud monitoring. It is a
   vertically-pointing, low-peak-power, pulsed, Doppler system with
   excellent resolution and sensitivity for observing the structure of
   almost all clouds overhead. It uses a traveling wave tube amplifier and
   pulse compression techniques; its data system includes a commercial
   boundary layer wind profiler processor. The radar can cycle through
   different operating modes which emphasize low or high altitudes and
   different sensitivities. This unit, operated by ETL, is identical to
   the cloud radars which ETL designed for permanent operations at the
   U.S. Department of Energy's ARM Cloud and Radiation Testbed sites. This
   one, however, is intended for shorter-term use at various locations for
   a variety of research programs. It's first use was for the National
   Science Foundation's year-long SHEBA project in the Arctic Ocean. The
   radar is now housed, along with an ETL microwave radiometer and an IR
   radiometer, in a single sea container as a self-contained cloud
   research package. See three-page article for further details.

Microwave and Infrared Radiometers
     __________________________________________________________________

   Photo of two-channel microwave radiometer Radiometers are passive
   instruments which receive energy signals that are naturally emitted
   from objects within the instrument's viewing angle. A radiometer
   antenna pointed upward into the air receives infrared and radio
   frequency emissions from the atmosphere's various chemical
   constituents. Each constituent possesses a unique emission spectrum
   that corresponds exactly to its absorption spectrum. Radiometers
   "listen" at selected frequencies to best sort out the constituents and
   measure their abundances. By monitoring microwave emissions from the
   zenith at appropriate frequencies near 20 or 23 and 31 GHz, it is
   possible to measure both the total atmospheric water vapor content and
   the cloud liquid water content over head; additional observations at 90
   GHz allow very small amounts of liquid water to be detected. These
   path- integrated measurements provide information on the total amount
   of vapor and liquid along the radiometer's beam, but give no direct
   information about the range or altitude distribution of vapor or liquid
   in range along the beam. The infrared radiometers monitor thermal
   emissions near the wavelength of 11 microns. The measured IR brightness
   temperature is approximately equal to the physical temperature of cloud
   base for optically thick clouds, such as stratus.

   The radiometers are also useful for estimating cloud droplet sizes
   (microwave) and ice particle sizes (IR) and mass contents from the
   ground when used in concert with millimeter-wave cloud radar, as in
   ETL's MMCR package. Winds just above the ocean surface can also be
   estimated from airborne microwave radiometer observations of surface
   emissions, which depend on the wind-caused roughness of the ocean
   surface.

   NOAA/ETL has designed several microwave radiometer systems and operates
   them for a variety of atmospheric and ocean research programs. The
   ground-based systems are operated by ETL's Radar Meteorology &
   Oceanography Division. The airborne system is operated by the Ocean
   Remote Sensing Division which also operates state-of-the-art
   polarization and multi-frequency microwave radiometers, not discussed
   here, primarily for observing the ocean surface.

Radar Acquisition and Display System (RADS)

   Radar Processor

   RADS as installed for Coast Guard test flights.
   The Radar Acquisition and Display System (RADS) is a configurable
   system designed to record and display data from a research Doppler
   radar with polarization diversity. Constructed primarily from
   commerically available components, the VME-based processor controls
   radar operations, data acquisition and display through a graphical
   interface. Incorporating GPS navigation directly into the data stream,
   it can be configured for ground, aircraft and ship based radars. The
   programmable processor allows for real-time calculation and display of
   custom data fields and monitoring of data quality.
