Welcome to the Customs Electronic Bulletin Board (CEBB)

     The Customs Electronic Bulletin Board has served information to the
   international trade community from January, 1991, through December 31,
   1999, via a dial-up modem connection. The same information is now
   available through the Internet on the U.S. Customs Service Web Site.



   Please note that the CEBB will be shutdown every Friday from 6:00pm to
   about 9:00pm (E.S.T.) for routine maintenance.
