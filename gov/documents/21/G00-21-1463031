   General Information

   To browse through a broad range of federal information resources
   available online, you may want to visit the U.S. Consumer Gateway web
   site maintained by the Federal Trade Commission.  The Consumer Gateway
   site is designed so that you can locate information by category -- such
   as Food, Health, Product Safety, Your Money, and Transportation. Each
   category has subcategories to direct you to areas within individual
   federal web sites containing related information. It also has
   information on fraudulent and deceptive practices in the market place
   and important law-enforcement information and tips to avoid scams.

   Many general consumer matters are better handled or - in some cases -
   exclusively handled by State and/or local government and we encourage
   you to check with these authorities in addition to Federal offices.

   If youre unsure which agency in your State would handle a particular
   issue, you may call our National Contact Center toll-free
   1-800-688-9889 (TDD/TTY users, call: 1-800-326-2996), or check our
   State and Local Government web page.

   For general guidance on resolving consumer complaints, take a look
   through the Consumer Action Handbook, available through the Federal
   Consumer Information Center.

   Telephone Slamming

   This is the illegal practice of changing your long distance company
   without your permission. If you feel this has happened to you, your
   best source for information is the Federal Communications Commission.

   Bill Collectors

   Both Federal and State laws regulate the activities of certain bill and
   debt collectors. If you are not sure whether a bill collector is
   respecting your rights under your States laws, you may inquire at the
   appropriate office within your State (check our State and Local
   Government web page), often the office of the Attorney General. You may
   check about compliance to Federal law on the web site of the Federal
   Trade Commission. Image linking to top of page
