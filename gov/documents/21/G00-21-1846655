HIV and AIDS Malignancy Branch

   Overview

   Robert Yarchoan, MD, Chief

   The HIV and AIDS Malignancy Branch (HAMB) in the Division of Clinical
   Sciences of the National Cancer Institute conducts translational
   research on HIV infection and AIDS-related malignancies in children and
   adults. Investigators engage in basic laboratory research, preclinical
   studies, and clinical trials aimed at developing novel therapies for
   AIDS and AIDS-related malignancies and on understanding the effects of
   these therapies on disease pathogenesis. More information about the
   research effort in HAMB is available by clicking on HAMB Staff and
   Research.

   The clinical research is directed toward treatment of HIV infection
   itself and cancers associated with AIDS, such as Kaposi's sarcoma and
   AIDS-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Clinical research trials are
   being conducted for both adults and pediatric patients with HIV
   infection or AIDS.

   Information on HAMB adult and pediatric clinical trials is available by
   clicking on the relevant menu options to the left. Within each section,
   the protocol name is followed by a brief description. You can click on
   the protocol name to get more detailed information about the protocol.

   If one of the protocols interests you, e-mail or call the indicated
   contact person for the protocol at the number listed.
