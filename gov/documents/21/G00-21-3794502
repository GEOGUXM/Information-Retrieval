                             ABAG TIPS for Riding Out Earthquakes and Other Disasters

   [pushpin.gif]
   Think Ahead! What if you are driving when an earthquake or other
   disaster strikes?
   [turq.gif] How long is your commute?
   [turq.gif] How long is your commute after an accident?
   [turq.gif] How long will your commute be after earthquakes or other
   disasters?

   [check.gif] Don't run out of gas. Run on the top half of the tank, not
   the bottom half.
   [check.gif] Keep emergency food, water, a light source, first aid
   supplies/perscriptions, walking shoes and comfortable clothes, change,
   and a whistle in a spare back pack or bag as a "car kit." Kids and
   parents can have fun together with this Java-based Car Kit Wordsearch
   Game.
   [check.gif] Slow down and tune in to your radio for emergency
   bulletins.
   [check.gif] Does your child's school have a list of other responsible
   people authorized to pick them up if you are delayed?
   [check.gif] Do you have back-up plans for feeding and safety of pets?

   Think Ahead! What if you are stuck at work after a quake?
   [check.gif] Do you have a 3-5 day supply of medications at your office?
   [check.gif] Do you keep walking shoes at work?
   [check.gif] Does your child's school have a list of other responsible
   people authorized to pick them up if you are delayed? You can also keep
   a list of these contacts in your car using our Car Guide.

   [pushpin.gif] Did You Know?
   [turq.gif] Seismic retrofit of the Golden Gate Bridge will not be
   completed until 2006.
   [turq.gif] Seismic retrofit of the West Span and replacement of the
   East Span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge will not be completed
   until 2007.
   [turq.gif] Even local bridges across creeks can have damage in
   earthquakes. Look for these as you drive today between home, schools,
   work, and shopping. Plan alternate routes!

   [check.gif] For more information on expected road closure information,
   view ABAG's MAPS showing concentrations of road closures following
   future earthquakes.
   [check.gif] Caltrans has produced a fun CONNECT THE DOTS bridge
   retrofit activity worksheet for kids (and adults). (These are Adobe
   Acrobat Files)
   [check.gif] For online route planning, you can use MapQuest or
   MapsOnUs.
   [check.gif] To help you think of other ways to get to and from work,
   check out the list of travel options provided with this Java-based
   Transportation Options Wordsearch Game.

   [pushpin.gif] Did You Know? San Francisco International Airport (SFO),
   Oakland International Airport (OAK), and San Jose International Airport
   (SJC) can have runway damage in an earthquake due to LIQUEFACTION.

   [check.gif] Plan other ways to get your products to other parts of the
   country!

   Think Ahead! What if you're at home during a quake?
   [check.gif] Keep a 3-5 day supply of food, water, and medicines.
   [check.gif] Stay at home, assuming it is safe to do so. Avoid driving.

   [pushpin.gif]
   Think Ahead! If the phones work, use the phone, not your car!
   [check.gif] Change your voice mail message to state that you are safe.
   [check.gif] You may have to wait a bit longer for dial tone after a
   quake. Be patient. Don't just hang up and try again.
   [check.gif] Keep change or a pre-paid phone card in your wallet.

   [pushpin.gif]
   Do you want to do more?
   [check.gif] Print out copies of the CAR GUIDE and give them to your
   friends in English, Spanish, or Chinese. (These are Adobe Acrobat
   Files)
   [check.gif] As a business, you may want to reproduce this Newsletter
   version of the Car Guide for your employees. Due to the attacks on the
   World Trade Center and Pentagon, we have also prepared a Revised
   Newsletter version that expands the focus of the Car Guide to include
   other disasters. (If you decide to do this, please email us using the
   "contact" button below so we know! A "Word" version of this file is
   available on request.)
   [check.gif] As a business, you may also want to use this Checklist to
   identify other types of things you can do to help solve potential
   traffic problems. (Again, if you decide to do this, please email us

   file is available on request.)
