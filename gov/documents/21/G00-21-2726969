   Welcome to the IV&V Facility!
   Located in the heart of West Virginia's emerging technology sector, the
   NASA Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Facility was
   established in 1993 as part of an agency-wide strategy to provide the
   highest achievable levels of safety and cost-effectiveness for mission
   critical software. The IV&V Facility was founded under the NASA Office
   of Safety and Mission Assurance as a direct result of recommendations
   made by the National Research Council (NRC) and the Report of the
   Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident. Since
   then, the IV&V Facility has experienced continual growth in personnel,
   projects, capabilities, and accomplishments. The IV&V Facility's
   efforts have contributed to the improved safety record of NASA since
   its inception. Today, the IV&V Facility is governed by the Goddard
   Space Flight Center and houses over 150 full-time employees and
   leverages the expertise of over 20 in-house partners and contractors.
   For more information about the capabilities of the IV&V Facility,
