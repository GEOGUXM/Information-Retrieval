                              Titan Occultation

                              [titan_small.jpg]

    On 12/20/01 Titan occulted both stars of a binary system (separation
     ~1.5 arcseconds). The image above shows both Titan just starting to
   occult the first and second star. The spatially resolved observation of
    the occultation provides a new, powerful technique for investigating
     Titan's atmosphere from Earth that is only possible using adaptive
     optics. Click on the image to view a movie of the event or "Latest
                    PALAO Results" for more information.
