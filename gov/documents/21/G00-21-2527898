   Little Missouri River and associated watersheds in Wyoming, Montana,
   North Dakota and South Dakota. Its goal is to research, develop and
   demonstrate ecologically based integrated pest management strategies
   that landowners and land managers can use to achieve effective,
   affordable leafy spurge control.

   and conducted cooperatively with the USDA-Animal and Plant Health
   Inspection Service (APHIS).
