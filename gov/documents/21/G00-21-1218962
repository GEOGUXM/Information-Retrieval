           I believe that you should know exactly where I stand on the
      important issues that confront our state and nation. I believe this not
      only because it will allow you to better evaluate my service in the
      United States Congress, but also because I am committed to wrenching
      our political system away from special interests and putting it back in
      the hands of working families. By detailing my positions on the issues
      important to you, I hope that the negative influence of special
      interest money can be defeated.
           Some politicians do everything in their power not to let voters
      know where they stand on issues. I want to be a different kind of
      leader. I hope the detailed positions that are presented here - and
      more will be coming soon - will prove to you my commitment to be the
      kind of leader who will restore honor to politics and who will never
      run from or hide away my most deeply-felt principles.
