   About ESO
   [blank.gif] As part of LANLs Environmental Science and Waste Technology
   Division, the Environmental Stewardship Office (ESO) manages numerous
   lab projects including Pollution Prevention (P2) and GSAF- the
   Generator Set-Aside Fee. ESOs P2 efforts focus on cost-effective waste
   minimization, energy and water conservation, recycling, reuse, and
   Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP).
   [blank.gif] ESO helps lab organizations implement and fund Pollution
   Prevention programs through the GSAF program; we help organizations in
   their efforts to comply with current Environmental Regulations,
   Liabilities and Legal responsibilities; we offer assistance with
   resource conservation, waste minimization, recycling, and EPP; and we
   can show you how P2 can increase efficiency, reduce operational costs,
   and create a significant Return on Investment while concurrently
   improving environmental quality.
   [blank.gif] Also, in recognition of exemplary P2 practices at the lab,
   ESO presents annual awards to individuals, teams, groups, and
   organizations that are making the effort to move beyond mere regulatory
   compliance and toward Environmental Excellence. It is ESOs hope that
   everyone at LANL will strive for improved environmental quality and to
   facilitate this we offer assistance to all lab organizations applying
   for the New Mexico Green Zia Environmental Excellence Award.
