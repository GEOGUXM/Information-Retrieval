     Since its inception in June of 1990, the Office of Education has
     become the front door for many candidates to the myriad of
     educational and training opportunities at the National Institutes of
     Health. Staff in the office are available to assist candidates at
     every step of the application process, from identifying research
     laboratories with projects matching the interests of the candidate
     to arranging interviews with prospective preceptors. The office also
     provides information on relocating to the Washington, DC area and on
     daycare.
     [clear.gif] The Office of Education also serves as a resource for
     those with questions on career advancement issues at the NIH. Office
     staff are available to help explain the tenure process at NIH and to
     assist fellows encountering difficulties in their training or
     educational program.
     [clear.gif] Additional information on residency or subspecialty
     programs is available from the Office of Education to individuals
     seeking clinical training. The Office of Education provides
     institutional oversight for NIH residency and subspecialty programs
     accredited by the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical
     Education and clinical fellows are selected to serve as members of
     the Graduate Medical Education Committee that reviews the clinical
     training programs. The office also sponsors the awarding of Category
     I Continuing Medical Education Credit at NIH and this allows
     trainees to continue their medical education.
     [clear.gif] The office also serves as a source of information on
     additional educational opportunities on campus. Fellows seeking
     specialized sources of training are also encouraged to contact
     office staff for assistance.
