   Plaintiffs-Appellees v. MICROSOFT CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellant
   APPELLEES' JOINT RESPONSE TO MOTIONS REGARDING AMICUS PARTICIPATION The
   Court's Order of October 26, 2000, directed that the parties file any
   responses to the motions for leave to participate as amicus curiae by
   Monday, October 30, 2000. In light of the importance of the case, the
   United States and the State Plaintiffs gave consent to all movants who
   sought it prior to filing. We support the Court's permitting any amicus
   filings that it would find helpful. In the interest of full disclosure,
   we note that one movant, Dr. Lee A. Hollaar, provided compensated
   consulting services to the Antitrust Division of the Department of
   Justice in 1995 in connection with a matter involving Microsoft
   Corporation. Respectfully submitted. Catherine G. O'Sullivan/s/ ELIOT
