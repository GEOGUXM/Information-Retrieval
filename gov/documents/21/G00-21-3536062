                       Reaction Of Sen. Patrick Leahy,
                    Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,
              To The Complaint Filed Against John Walker Lindh

                                Jan. 15, 2002

   "As a former prosecutor I know the Attorney General faced a difficult
   and complex decision. I support his decision.

   "Like every American I was appalled that someone from our country would
   join and fight with an organization as repulsive and repressive as the
   Taliban, which abetted terrorism and murder and which abused the
   fundamental human rights of the Afghan people, especially its women.

   "I hope that Mr. Walker will fully cooperate with the FBI as this case
   goes forward."
