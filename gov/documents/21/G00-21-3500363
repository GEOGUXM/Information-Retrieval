   What can I do to protect my home from wildland fires?

   To protect your home from wildfires you must create a safety zone or
   firebreak by reducing the amount of dead or dying fuel (vegetation)
   around your home.  This does not necessarily mean all vegetation should
   be removed.  In fact, having fire-resistant plants and trees around
   your home that are properly trimmed and well watered can serve as a
   firebreak.  For a list of things to do to protect your home from
   wildfires call the Public Education Department @ 916-566-4000.

   What do firefighters do when they are not on calls fighting fires?

   Training takes up a good deal of their time when they are not on a
   call.  Firefighters are required to have at least 20 hours of training
   hours each month.  Firefighters also participate in fire safety
   inspections and drive the community to become familiar with the area to
   reduce response time during incidents.  Firefighters must also check
   and maintain their equipment and clean and maintain their stations.

   What is the best thing to do for a burn?

   Cool a burn with water.  Do not use ointments, butter, or other
   substances.  For minor burns contact a physician.  For serious burns
   call 9-1-1 immediately.

   What kind of fire extinguisher should I buy?

   Homeowners should buy an extinguisher that can handle Class A-B-C
   fires.  They should be designed to extinguish fires that occur in
   homes; including wood, paper, flammable liquids, and electrical fires.
   Call 916-566-4000 for a fire extinguisher brochure.

   Back to top


   Does the fire department service fire extinguishers?

   No, the fire department does not service fire extinguishers. The fire
   department recommends that you look up Fire Extinguishers in the yellow
   pages and contact any of those companies. The fire department does
   provide fire extinguisher training. Call 566-4000 and ask for the
   Community Services representative that provides fire extinguisher
   training.

   Do I need to put a smoke detector in every room?  How many do I need?

   Smoke detectors should be placed outside each sleeping area and on
   every level of the home, including the basement.  On floors without
   bedrooms, detectors should be installed in or near living areas such as
   dens, living rooms, or family rooms.

   Back to top


   Does the fire department give away smoke detectors?

   Yes, the fire department has smoke detectors for those that cannot
   afford to purchase one. Call 566-4000 and ask to speak to someone in
   the Community Services Division.

   Are you listed in the telephone book?

   Yes, the main administration phone number is listed in the white pages
   under Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District.

   Why do I have to call 9-1-1?  Can't I call the fire station direct and
   save time?

   The 9-1-1 emergency system is designed to save valuable seconds.  When
   you dial 9-1-1, the system routes the police or fire unit that is
   closest to your home.  Fire stations are not properly equipped to take
   emergency calls and calling the station directly wastes valuable
   response time.

   Back to top


   Should I call 9-1-1 for a fire that I put out?

   Yes. No matter how big or small, you should always have the fire
   department check any fire. We want to make sure the fire has not
   extended up into the wall or attic.

   Can I use salt or baking soda to put out a grease fire?

   No, the only thing you should use to put out a grease fire is a lid or
   an approved "Class ABC" fire extinguisher. You should always have a
   properly fitting lid next to the stove so that if a fire should start
   you can quickly put a lid over the pan and turn off the burner.

   How much does your gear weigh when fighting a fire?

   Typically when fighting a fire, the firefighter will be outfitted with
   turnouts, tools,  and a breathing apparatus.  This equipment generally
   weighs approximately 60 pounds.

   Is a firefighter's helmet made of plastic or leather?

   Firefighters wear many different types of helmets. Helmets can be made
   of plastic, fiberglass, and leather. The most typical helmet is made of
   composite fiberglass.

   Does your department have a Dalmatian?

   At this time the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District does not have a
   Dalmatian as a member of the department.

   Back to top


   Why do fire fighters always take a fire engine to shop for their meals?

   Due to the nature of a fire fighter's work schedule it becomes
   necessary for the crews to remain together as engine and truck
   companies. Staying together as a team keeps the crews available to
   respond for emergency calls in their assigned areas.

   How many calls does your department run?

   In 1999 the predecessor agencies ran a total of 55, 848 calls.

   How do I schedule a station tour?

   Call 566-4000 and get the fire station business phone number. Once you
   get the phone number you should contact the station and ask to speak to
   the Captain that will be on duty the day you would like to visit. The
   Captain will then schedule the station tour with you.

   How do I get a firefighter to come to our school?

   Call 566-4000 and ask to speak to someone in the Community Services
   Division.

   What is the difference between an engine and truck?

   A fire engine typically carries water and hose. An engine company's
   responsibilities on a fire are rescue, fire attack, overhaul, and water
   supply. A fire truck typically has an aerial ladder on it along with
   other rescue equipment. A truck company's responsibilities on a fire
   are rescue, ladder work, ventilation, salvage, overhaul, and
   extrication. Both engine and truck companies are trained in first-aid
   and many have a paramedic as a crew member.

   Are the fire engines shift or automatic transmission?

   Most fire engines are automatic transmission.

   How come the firefighters don't ride on the back of a fire engine
   anymore?

   In the past, firefighters rode on the 'tailboard' because there was not
   enough seats for all the volunteers. These days, safety is the issue.

   Back to top


   Why are most fire engines red?

   Fire engines are red for two reasons. One reason is that fire engines
   have traditionally been colored red. Also, red is a high visibility
   color. Some apparatus is not red because it has a different purpose.
   For example the Sac Metro airplane crash rigs are yellow because they
   carry foam for special operations.

   Who do I call if my son or daughter is playing with matches?

   Call 566-4000 and ask for the Community Services representative that
   provides Juvenile Firesetter Intervention Information. You may also
   look up the Juvenile Firesetter page on this web site in the Fire
   Prevention area, or by clicking here.

   What can I do if my child has a fascination with fire?

   First, make sure all matches and lighters are out of the reach of the
   child. Keep matches and lighters up high in a locked cabinet. Then call
   566-4000 and ask for the Community Services representative that
   provides Juvenile Firesetter Intervention Information.
