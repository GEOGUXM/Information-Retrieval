   For more than two centuries our flag has been a symbol of hope in the
   face of danger and strength in times of peace. Now, as the country
   stares down a new peril, Americans are flying the banner proudly,
   heeding its call for unity.

   America protects the freedom our flag represents by displaying it in
   many ways, at our homes, as ribbons and pins, in our actions and as
   photographs as is displayed here.

   rescue workers searching through the debris Sept. 12.
