    I. History

   [retrans-1.jpg] Kindled by a desire to spread the excitement of
   America's space program and of the Space Shuttle in particular, members
   of the Goddard Amateur Radio Club (WA3NAN) and the Amateur Satellite
   Corporation (AMSAT) devised a plan to re-transmit live, air-to-ground
   audio over amateur frequencies.

   After overcoming many hurdles, the Shuttle Retransmission effort began
   on August 31, 1983, 7 hours prior to the launch of Challenger on
   mission STS-8 on the local AMSAT/GARC 2 meter repeater by virtue of a
   waiver granted by the FCC for this purpose.
   Retransmissions expanded to HF frequencies with the launch of STS-9 on
   November 28, 1983. Among many firsts for the Shuttle program during
   this mission was the first use of amateur radio from space by Mission
   Specialist Owen Garriott, W5LFL.
   Joe Grzesik, KU3Z helps put final touches on the new station
       The success of this effort is shared by NASA, the Goddard Space
       Flight Center, AMSAT, hundreds of dedicated volunteer control
       operators, and by the world-wide support of the Amateur Community.

   II. Frequencies
       Retransmission of Shuttle air-to-ground audio from WA3NAN may be
       heard on the following frequencies:

                 Frequency (MHz)    Mode       Antennas
                 3.860           SSB LSB    N-S/E-W Dipoles
                 7.185           SSB LSB    N-S/E-W Dipoles
                 14.295          SSB USB    3-element Yagi
                 21.395          SSB USB    5-element Yagi
                 28.650          SSB USB    4-element Yagi
                 147.45          FM Simplex Phased vertical

       Where SSB is Single-Side-Band and LSB, USB indicate either Lower
       and Upper Side Band. A short-wave receiver possessing a Beat
       Frequency Oscillator (BFO) is needed to receive these
       transmissions.

   III. Frequently Asked Questions About Shuttle Retransmissions

    A. When Are You On The Air ?--There are several criteria that best
       determine when you will be able to receive Shuttle Retransmissions
       (not necessarily in order of priority):

    1. While The Crew Is Awake--We are usually on the air from the time
       the crew gets its wakeup call (assuming the mission is not of the
       24 hour variety) till the time they go into what is called
       "Pre-Sleep".
     When Volunteer Operators Are Available--We have a limited pool of
       operators available during any single mission. The most difficult
       days and nights to schedule are usually on the weekends.
     When Local Weather Permits--We are located in Greenbelt, MD just
       outside Washington DC. If you do not hear us and have the means to
       do so, check our current local weather. If there are thunderstorms
       (or other inclement weather such as a recent snowfall) currently in
       the area or predicted, we will likely be off the air until such
       weather has passed.
     When Equipment Is Operational--Given the nature of our equipment, we
       typically have at least one major failure during a mission. Though
       we strive to get the failed equipment back on-line as soon as
       possible there will be downtimes for all bands.

     How Soon Before Launch Do You Go On The Air?--We usually begin
   retransmissions about 1 hour before the predicted launch time.

     Does Anyone Get Paid To Do This?--No. This is purely a voluntary
   activity by our membership as a public service to all Radio Amateurs.

     What Is NASA's Involvement With The Club?--The Goddard Amateur Radio
   Club is one of many employee clubs sanctioned by the Goddard Employee
   Welfare Association (GEWA).

     Your Shuttle Retransmissions Are Interfering With My Net...--We
   apologize and try to accommodate other Amateur Radio activities that
   our retransmissions may interfere with. This decision is usually made
   by the Control Operator on duty and/or the Shuttle Retransmission
   Director. The club leadership may also consider requests made , in
   writing, by groups or individual Radio Amateurs.

     Why Do Other Hams Interfere With Shuttle Retransmissions--Contrary to
   popular belief, Radio Amateurs share the frequencies we are allotted by
   the FCC and our license class. All are free to use the frequencies
   whenever they want and may not even realize that they are on top of our
   signal. During missions, we ID the station frequently to let others
   know that the frequency is in use.

     I Do Not Hear You In Anytown, Planet Earth, But I Know You Must Be On
   The Air, Why?--If you know that we are on the air and you cannot
   receive our signal and the problem is not with your equipment (receiver
   and antenna), then it is likely that signal propagation is not good for
   your geographic location.. Good propagation depends on a number of
   factors and varies with solar cycle (and storms), time of day, some
   atmospheric conditions, whether the given frequencies "skip zone" is
   such that the signal even reaches your location, and what direction and
   power we are transmitting. We welcome propagation reports since it
   tells us if it is indeed propagation, or that perhaps it is an antenna
   or transmitter problem at the station.

     I Want To Send A Signal Report--You can send us a signal report to
   the addresses listed under Contact Information. Please include a
   Self-Addressed Stamped Envelope (SASE) with appropriate postage if you
   wish to receive confirmation of your report (we use the QSL bureaus for
   requests made outside the US). Note that postage comes out of the club
   budget.

     How Can I Get NASA TV--NASA Television offers the general public a
   front-row seat at mission launches and activities taking place in space
   during a mission, as well as informational and educational programming,
   historical documentaries, and updates on the latest developments in
   aeronautics and space science. NASA TV occasionally airs live coverage
   of SAREX activities. Programming is received by satellite dish or may
   be available through your local cable television network.

   NASA Television programming can be accessed through GE2, transponder
   9C. The frequency is 3880 MHz with an orbital position of 85 degrees
   West Longitude, with audio at 6.8 MHz. This is a full transponder
   service and will be operational 24 hours a day. Mission audio may be
   accessed on GE2, transponder 13 with a frequency of 3971.3 MHz,
   horizontal polarization.

   For more information, contact: Technology and Evaluation Branch,
   Education Division, Code FET, NASA Headquarters, Washington D.C. 20546,
   or call (202) 358-1540.

     Can I Retransmit Communications Between The Space Shuttle And Mission
   Control On Amateur Frequencies?--The FCC rules indicate that amateur
   stations are permitted to retransmit Space Shuttle air-to-ground
   communications, provided that approval has been obtained from NASA (FCC
   Rules, Part 97.113 (e)).

   In 1990, ARRL sought permission from NASA, on behalf of radio amateurs,
   to retransmit shuttle communications. The response from NASA's Office
   of Public Affairs encouraged such retransmissions, and indicated that
   the audio is public domain.

   If you plan to rebroadcast NASA Shuttle audio, please follow these
   guidelines:

    1. In keeping with good amateur practice and the FCC rules, shuttle
       audio retransmissions should be limited to missions of a specific
       educational purpose (non-commercial), such as those carrying the
       SAREX payload.
    2. Retransmissions should be done manually (with a control operator
       present).
    3. Occasionally, NASA audio may contain music. Amateurs should avoid,
       if at all possible, retransmitting music or any other prohibited
       transmissions not permitted by the FCC rules (FCC Rules, Part
       97.113).
       Please note however that the Shuttle audio retransmitted by GARC is
       not what one can receive from NASA TV. Rather, we get a direct feed
       from NASCOM. The difference is that this audio feed does not
       contain other coverage such as press briefings and mission status
       reports. This is significant because of restrictions on what are
       considered "permissible" transmissions by the FCC (see item c.
       above).

     I Want NASA Goodies, Where Can I Get Them?--By "goodies" I refer to
   patches, photos, information related to the Space program, NASA
   centers, GSFC, projects and so on. Rather than send such requests to
   GARC, we prefer that you send your queries to the GSFC Visitor's Center
   at:

                            GSFC Visitor's Center
                                 Code 130.0
            NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt MD 20771

     Can I Become A Member?--Membership is presently limited to GSFC Civil
   Servant and Contractor employees and their immediate families. We do
   extend membership to those outside GSFC provided they assist us with
   our public service activities including Shuttle Retransmission. We are
   working to allow other levels of membership to include a "Contributing
   Membership" that would allow interested individuals to receive our
   monthly newsletter and help to offset the cost of our activities.
