     Introduction
     The Division of Financial Advisory Services (DFAS) is a centralized
     office that supports the Office of the Director, NIH; contracts,
     grants and program officials of NIHs Institutes and Centers; and
     business management officials of NIHs contractors and grantees.
     DFAS provides financial advice, participates in the development,
     coordination and implementation of cost policy relating to contracts
     and grants, resolves audit findings, performs cost analyses and
     special reviews, and negotiates indirect cost rates with commercial
     companies. The Division is staffed with a dedicated group of
     auditors and administrative staff working as a team to support NIHs
     multi-billion dollar contracts and grants programs.

     Mission
     The DFAS mission is to provide quality financial advice and services
     to ensure the appropriate funding and reimbursement of contracts and
     grants.

     Organization (see Organizational Chart)
     In addition to the Director and his immediate staff, DFAS has two
     specialized Branches, i.e., the Indirect Cost Branch and the Special
     Reviews Branch. A complete staff listing and specific areas of
     responsibility are shown on each organizational components web
     page.
