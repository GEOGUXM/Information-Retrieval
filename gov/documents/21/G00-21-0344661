              100th Anniversary of the Wright Brothers' Flight

   On December 17, 1903, after many years of research that included dialog
   with other aeronautical enthusiasts, experimentation in a wind tunnel
   of their own making, and test flights of full and subscale models,
   Wilbur and Orville Wright made the first powered controlled flights in
   an airplane.

   In 1915, the Congress of the United States created the National
   Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), NASA's predecessor
   organization, "to supervise and direct the scientific study of the
   problems of flight with a view to their practical solution." Orville
   Wright was one of the original members of the NACA. In 1917 the NACA
   began building its first laboratory, Langley Memorial Aeronautical
   Laboratory, now NASA Langley Research Center, to carry out the
   Congressional mandate.

   As the second century of powered flight begins, we at NASA Langley
   continue to explore the challenges of aerospace. Langley researchers
   use the tools of collaboration, wind tunnels, and models that the
   Wright Brothers used. Through engineering and technology innovations we
   have added the tools of mathematical computer modeling and flight
   simulation. Today, Langley researchers strive to increase the safety,
   reduce the noise level, reduce the environmental impact, and increase
   the efficiency of aircraft. We are also looking at ways to increase
   current airport capacity safely and to make air travel more affordable.
   At this first century mark, we reflect on past achievements in flight
   and appreciate what has been accomplished.

   Wright Brothers, other aeronautical pioneers, and the history of
   flight, as well as NASA accomplishments and goals. This site also
   provides information on events and activities at NASA Langley Research
   Center and other locations prior to and during the centennial of flight
   celebration.
