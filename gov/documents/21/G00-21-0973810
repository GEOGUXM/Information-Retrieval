        Two Brooklyn Men Indicted in Connection with Largest Seizure
                of Counterfeit DVDs in United States History

    ALAN VINEGRAD, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New
   York, and STEVEN CAREY, Special Agent-in-Charge of the New York Office
   of the United States Secret Service, today announced the indictment of
         ABDULLAH QAZA and KHALID GHNAIM for copyright and trademark
       infringement in connection with the large scale manufacture and
   distribution of counterfeit compact discs (CDs) and digital video discs
     (DVDs). From March through December 2001, the defendants operated a
    distribution center out of a storefront on Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn.
     The operation, which law enforcement officials estimate distributed
     thousands of counterfeit newly released CDs and DVDs weekly, was a
   principal source of supply for a network of outdoor flea market vendors
    in the metropolitan area. On December 13, 2001, agents of the United
     States Secret Service executed search warrants at the factory and a
   nearby storage facility where the defendants warehoused the counterfeit
    goods, effectively shutting down their enterprise. Law enforcements
    mid-December operation resulted in the largest seizure of counterfeit
   DVDs in United States history, with over 30,000 counterfeit movies and
    an equal number of counterfeit musical recordings with a total retail
                     value of approximately $1 million.
       In addition to mass-producing a wide variety of popular musical
    recordings from rock to rap, including popular recording artists like
   Santana, Jennifer Lopez and R. Kelly, the defendants distributed movies
       that were either newly released or soon to be released on DVD,
       including the Godfather Trilogy, Cats and Dogs, and the Grinch.
   The defendants were arrested on a previously filed complaint. QAZA, who
    is 19 years old, was released on a $200,000 bond co-signed by family
   members. Defendant GHNAIM, who is 35 years old and is QAZAs uncle, has
             been detained in federal custody since December 13.
     The indictment charges QAZA and GHNAIM with copyright and trademark
   infringement and conspiracy, and seeks forfeiture of the assets of the
   defendants business. Both defendants face up to 10 years in prison and
                      a $2 million fine if convicted.^1
     In announcing the indictment Mr. VINEGRAD stated, "The defendants
   arrests are the results of federal law enforcements redoubled efforts
   to coordinate with private industry to combat the widespread assault on
      the intellectual property of American business, in this case the
   recording and motion picture industries and the artists they promote."
    The defendants will be arraigned next week in United States District
   Court at the United States Courthouse, 225 Cadman Plaza East, Brooklyn,
                                  New York.
    The governments case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States
   Attorney Lauren Resnick, Deputy Chief of the districts Computer Crimes
                     and Intellectual Property Section.
           Pedigree information for the defendants is as follows:
