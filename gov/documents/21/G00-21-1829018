   Real-time Detection of Fringe Signal
   OBJECTIVES:
   In general, to improve the performance characteristics of earth-based
   and space-based telescopes:

   Light waves from astronomical objects are distorted as it travels
   through the earth's atmosphere. The simplest case of this is the
   twinkling of stars. For earth-based telescopes, these distortions place
   a limit on the resolution of seeing. Space-based telescopes such as the
   Hubble Space Telescope are high above the atmosphere and do not have
   this problem. Until recently, the detection and correction of
   atmospheric distortions were difficult to achieve. Adaptive optics
   approaches have been used to compensate for atmospheric distortions.

   Most adaptive optics systems use custom-built, very expensive optical
   and computer systems to detect and compensate for wavefront
   distortions. Recent studies have shown that neural network technologies
   can be used to detect and provide corrections to an adaptive optics
   system using a relatively simple optics setup. This approach would
   reduce the cost of adaptive optics systems and offer improved
   performance.

   Space-based telescopes have other sources of disturbances that affect
   seeing. The telescopes structural vibrations can be a significant
   problem. It is anticipated that signal detection techniques being
   developed for earth-based telescopes can also be applied to detect low
   level signals from the background of noise due to structural
   vibrations.

   BACKGROUND

   Code ICs Smart Systems Research Lab and Code SSAs Infrared Astronomy
   Team at NASA Ames are working together to improve the performance
   capabilities of the IOTA Interferometer Facility at Kitt Peak, Arizona.
   The planned improvements are phased over a period of three years. In
   the first phase, work is focused on improving the fringe signal
   detection and measurement system, also called the fringe tracker
   project. In the second phase, work will focus on developing algorithms
   to improve the performance of the adaptive optics in the existing
   infrared interferometer. The third phase will focus on implementation
   and testing of the adaptive optics control algorithms at the IOTA
   facility.
