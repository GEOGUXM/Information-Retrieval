   The National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory
   in New York, is a national user research facility funded by the U.S.
   Department of Energy (DOE). The NSLS operates two electron storage
   rings: an X-Ray Ring and a Vacuum Ultra Violet (VUV) Ring which provide
   intense focused light spanning the electromagnetic spectrum from the
   infrared through x-rays.

   The properties of this light and the specially designed experimental
   stations, called beamlines, allow scientists in many fields of research
   to perform experiments not otherwise possible at their own
   laboratories.

   Take an online tour of the NSLS or learn about its history.
