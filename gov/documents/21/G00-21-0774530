   ABOUT US
   In April 1995, the Department of Commerce formed a Business Process
   Re-engineering (BPR) Team to radically redesign the way the Department
   purchases goods and services. After intensive study and evaluation of
   the "as-is" acquisition process, in January 1996 the BPR Team proposed
   a new Acquisition Concept of Operations ("Conops") model which is a
   part of the Department of Commerce Case for Change. The new process
   uses the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) as its
   springboard to launch new projects, and is designed to be timely,
   efficient, and responsive to customer needs.
   In the old model, program offices typically submitted procurement
   requests to the contracting office; the process continued with the
   program and contracting offices passing the ball back and forth for
   months, and sometimes years. The new model approaches acquisitions with
   a focus on achieving mission objectives. The foundation is built on
   four themes:
     * Dramatically streamlined process

     * High performing teams

     * Partnerships with vendors

     * New uses of technology

   Multi-functional, high performing teams will focus on executing
   specific mission objectives that implement bureau and line office
   strategic plans. Team members will work together, from identification
   of need to contract close-out, to acquire the goods and services needed
   to achieve these objectives. The Acquisition Concept of Operations
   envisions a team serving to fulfill program requirements from
   identification of need to contract close-out. Moreover, acquisition
   professionals will now function as an integral part of the team to
   achieve mission objectives. The focus under CONOPS will be on getting
   the job done, not on doing the job.
   In May 1996, the Department of Commerce chose two bureaus to road test
   the key features of the streamlined acquisition process. The Patent and
   Trademark Office and the Bureau of the Census were designated as
   official Acquisition CONOPS pilot sites wit three pilot projects each.
   The pilot phase ended in December 1996. The results, as presented by an
   independent evaluation team, were greatly reduced cycle times and
   strong team confidence in the ability of the selected vendor to deliver
   high quality goods and services. The success and timeliness of these
   projects has led to the use of CONOPS in other acquisitions and a new
   way of doing business at the Department of Commerce.
