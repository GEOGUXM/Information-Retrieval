   Transporation Data Links

   Overview
   The Transportation Data Links provides the transportation community
   with a one-stop gateway to relevant transportation data and
   information. Individuals, decision- and policy- makers, private sector
   businesses, and organizations in the transportation community from
   Metropolitan Planning Organizations to state Department of
   Transportations will increasingly need access to timely and relevant
   data to help them meet their data needs more effectively and
   efficiently. Having one-stop access to transportation-related
   information and data improves their ability to assess the changing
   state of the nation's transportation system. The Transportation Data
   Links in ITDB is one means of enhancing informed decision making by the
   transportation community.
   This website is being developed in phases. Additional capabilities and
   data links will be available as the site evolves.
   When you click on the links below, you may leave the BTS Internet site
   and go to other Federal government websites with transportation-related
   data and statistics.
