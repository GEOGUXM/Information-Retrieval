   Data Organization and Format

   The September 09, 2001 ML 4.2 West Hollywood, California Earthquake
   data recorded by the USGS National Strong-Motion Network (NSMN) are
   available via the NSMP ftp server in the folder (directory)
   "20010909_1" (ftp://smftp.wr.usgs.gov/20010909_1).    The time series
   provided are available in uncorrected acceleration, corrected
   acceleration, corrected velocity, corrected displacement, response
   spectra (relative displacement, relative velocity, pseudo-velocity, and
   absolute acceleration), and Fourier amplitude spectra of corrected
   acceleration.  All of the data are in SMC format.

   In a departure from previous file-naming conventions (where for a
   particular channel the different the time series data all had the same
   filename, and thus required separate directories for each data type),
   the file names for the data have the following form:

   uncorrected acceleration:      RRRRc_u.smc
   corrected acceleration:        RRRRc_a.smc
   corrected velocity:            RRRRc_v.smc
   corrected displacement         RRRRc_d.smc
   response spectra:              RRRRc_r.rs2
   Fourier amplitude spectra (f): RRRRc_f.fs1

   where 'RRRR' is the four-digit recorder serial number (including
   leading 0's), 'c' is the channel number of the recorder ('a'
   corresponds to channel 1, 'b' to channel 2 , etc), the '_x' is used to
   identify the data type, and the suffix refers to the data format (rs2
   and fs1 are valid SMC format types recognized by the BAP processing
   program.

   The data are stored in two directories: uncorrected (only uncorrected
   acceleration) and corrected (all of the corrected and processed data,
   including acceleration, velocity, displacement, response spectra and
   Fourier ampliude spectra. This convention for organizing the data was
   implemented to avoid confusion between the directory names (Vol1, Vol2,
   Â… Vol6) previously used for some earlier events and the standard
   conventions for Volume1, Volume2 and Volume 3 processing.

   Information on how the data are processed can be found in the section
   on DATA PROCESSING.

   Downloads

   To facilitate downloading the data, the data have been compressed into
   PC compatible ".zip" format.  The same zip file is located in the
   "zips" folder in "20010909_1/" on the NSMP ftp server,
   "ftp://smftp.wr.usgs.gov/20010909_1".  Time series and peak values data
   for station 5402 (Beverly Hills; PacBell Facility, S/N 0586) were added
   to the data set on 10/29/2001.  Time series and peak values data for
   stations 655 (Slymar; Jensen Filter Plant, S/N 1937 and 1939) and 757
   (Los Angeles; Sepulveda Canyon, S/N 1936) were added to the data set on
   11/14/2001.
