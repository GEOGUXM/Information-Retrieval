   The Division for Health Careers Diversity and Development (formerly
   Division of Health Professions Diversity) makes grants to schools and
   health professions training programs to increase diversity within the
   health fields. The grants provide disadvantaged and under-represented
   minority students and faculty opportunities to enhance their academic
   skills and obtain the support needed to graduate from health
   professions schools or faculty development programs. Scholarship, loan
   and loan repayment programs for disadvantaged health professions
   students and faculty are administered by the Division of Student
   Assistance.

   The three grant-making programs within the Division for Health
   Professions Diversity and Development are:
     * Health Careers Opportunity Program, which helps health professions
       training programs provide students from disadvantaged backgrounds
       opportunities to develop the skills necessary to enter the health
       professions;
     * Centers of Excellence, which enables health professions training
       programs to enlarge their applicant pools, enhance the academic
       performance of under-represented minority students, improve the
       recruitment and retention of under-represented minority faculty,
       and in other ways enhance the capacity of their graduates to
       provide health care services to people who are medically
       underserved; and
     * Minority Faculty Fellowship Program, which assists health
       professions training programs to increase the number of
       under-represented racial and ethnic minorities serving on their
       faculties.
