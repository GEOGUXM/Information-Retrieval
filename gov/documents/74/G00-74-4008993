Materials Research and Development Materials Research & Development

   This commercial research works to improve existing materials while
   developing the materials of tomorrow. Research on Aerogel  a material
   that is mostly air  may turn this "frozen smoke" into a clear knockout
   that could be used to make windows with the insulating properties of up
   to 30 panes of conventional glass, as well as open up a world of new
   products. U.S. industries such as Ford Motor Company, ALCOA, and Howmet
   Corporation are using commercial space research to improve the casting
   process, helping improve cast automotive and aerospace components.

Biotechnology Research

   biotechnology The manipulation of organic materials  cells, tissues,
   and even living organisms  offers many exciting possibilities for the
   future, from organic computers to improved aquaculture.

   Commercial researchers are using the microgravity environment to
   produce large, near perfect protein crystals, and research on insulin 
   used to treat diabetes, the fourth leading cause of death by disease
   has yielded crystals that far surpass the quality of insulin crystals
   grown on the ground.Using these crystals, industry partners are working
   to develop new and improved treatments for diabetes. [more]

Agribusiness

   Farmer harvesting crops The altered growth of plants in microgravity
   presents many exciting opportunities to commercial researchers.
   Investigations are underway to determine if those changes can be
   harnessed to enhance the production of anti-cancer compounds in certain
   plants.

   Research is also being done to see if it is possible to produce crop
   plants that will form nodules that can extract nitrogen from the air
   and soil  just as bean and other legume plants do  so that they will
   need less fertilizer. This could not only improve crop yields, but also
   help eliminate excess nitrogen compounds in the water running off from
   fields, which is a leading cause of water pollution.

   It may even be possible to improve the development of new varieties of
   plants in space, as doing such work in microgravity may improve the
   Earth-based success rate of 1 in a 1000 (0.1%) of getting a desired
   trait passed along to future plant generations. [more]
