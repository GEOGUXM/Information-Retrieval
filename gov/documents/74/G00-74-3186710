      Welcome to FirstGov for Seniors' Health page.  One third of Americans
      believe they have insufficient health information.  The Internet,
      accessible 24 hours per day, provides the ability to communicate and
      contains information about many health topics, such as diseases,
      treatments, health care providers, and health insurance plans.  The
      Internet is a valuable resource that could help to improve access of
      the elderly to health information.  This section is designed to
      facilitate immediate and convenient access to various types of reliable
      health information.

      Optimal health is a priority to society's mature population, yet due to
      changes on a daily basis regarding health programs, various treatments
      and a multitude of health care services, staying informed about the
      health industry can be a challenge.  The following categories are
      designed to guide you to reliable information and promote forward
      thinking about healthcare:

      "" Health, United States, 2001
      HHS released a new report, Health, United States, 2001, that shows
      Americans who live in the suburbs fare significantly better in many key
      health measures than those who live in the most rural and most urban
      areas.
