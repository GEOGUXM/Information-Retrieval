   The Lake Tahoe Basin was formed by geologic block (normal) faulting
   about 2 to 3 million years ago. A geologic block fault is a fracture in
   the Earth's crust causing blocks of land to move up or down. Uplifted
   blocks created the Carson Range on the east and the Sierra Nevada on
   the west. Down-dropped blocks created the Lake Tahoe Basin in between.
   Some of the highest peaks of the Lake Tahoe Basin that formed during
   this process were Freel Peak at 10,891 ft (3,320 m), Monument Peak at
   10,067 ft (3,068 m) (the present Heavenly Valley Ski Area), Pyramid
   Peak at 9,983 ft (3,043 m) (in the Desolation Wilderness), and Mt.
   Tallac at 9,735 ft (2,967 m).

   Snow, rain, and streams filled the southern and lowest part of the
   basin, forming the ancestral Lake Tahoe. Modern Lake Tahoe was shaped
   and landscaped by the scouring glaciers during the Ice Age (the Great
   Ice Age began a million or more years ago). Many streams flow into Lake
   Tahoe, but the lake is drained only by the Truckee River, which flows
   northeast through Reno and into Pyramid Lake in Nevada.

   Lake Tahoe is the second deepest lake in the United States and the
   tenth deepest in the world, with a maximum depth measured at 1,645 ft
   (501 m), average depth of 1,000 ft (305 m). footer image. Crater Lake
   in Oregon is the deepest lake (1,949 ft or 594 m) in the United States.
   Please Note that the depth of Lake Tahoe changes every day as the lake
   level changes. The deepest measurement from the 1998 bathymetric survey
   was 1,637 ft (499 m) deep. The depth of Lake Tahoe depends on the
   height it is measured from; some measurements use sea level as a base
   reference, others use different points of reference. The appropriate
   reference, or datum, for Lake Tahoe's depth is still being debated.
   Therefore the measured depth of a lake is only preliminary data and may
   change.

   Lake Tahoe is about 22 mi (57 km) long and l2 mi (31 km) wide and has
   72 mi (116 km) of shoreline and a surface area of 191 mi^2 (495 km^2).
   The floor of the Lake Tahoe Basin is at an elevation of about 4,580 ft
   (1,396 m), which is lower than the surface of the Carson Valley to the
   east! With an average surface elevation of 6,225 ft (1,897 m) above sea
   level, Lake Tahoe is the highest lake of its size in the United States.

   The water in Lake Tahoe could cover a flat area the size of California
   14 in (36 cm) deep. This amount of water is enough to supply everyone
   in the United States with 50 gallons of water per day for 5 years. The
   amount of water that evaporates from the surface of Lake Tahoe every
   year could supply a city the size of Los Angeles for 5 years.

   The water temperature near the surface generally cools to 40 to 50^oF
   (4.5 to 10^oC) during February and March and warms to 65 to 70^oF (18
   to 21^oC) during August and September. Below a depth of 600 to 700 ft
   (183 to 213 m), the water temperature remains a constant 39^oF
   (4.0^oC).

   Lake Tahoe has a water clarity of about 100 ft (30 m) deep. Factors
   contributing to its clarity include the following:
     * 40 percent of the precipitation that falls into the Lake Tahoe
       Basin lands directly on the lake.
     * Remaining precipitation drains through granitic soils, which are
       relatively sterile and create a good filtering system.
