         Senator Dodd's Statement on Initial Transition Results ---

   " Thanks to the hard work of hundreds of thousands of people across the
    country and around the world, in every industry and at every level of

   What is the Y2K Problem?

       For background, read the Special Committee's "100 Day Report" ,
                 released Sept 22, 1999. An excerpt follows:

     "Inherent uncertainty in the outcome of Y2K fuels concern and makes
      preparation difficult. Sensationalists continue to fuel rumors of
        massive Y2K failures and government conspiracies, while some
   corporations and nations concerned about their image downplay real Y2K
   problems. The Committee finds that both extremes are counterproductive,
   and do not accurately reflect what typifies most Y2K problems. The true
    extent of Y2K failures will match neither the most optimistic nor the
         most apocolyptic predictions. Rather, Y2K problems will hit
    sporadically, based on geography, size of organization, and level of
      preparedness, and will cause more inconveniences than tragedies."
