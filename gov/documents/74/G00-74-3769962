   The  SeaWinds scatterometer is a specialized microwave radar that
   measures near-surface wind velocity (both speed and direction) under
   all weather and cloud conditions. SeaWinds transmits pulses of
   microwave radiation at 13.4 Ghz and measures the backscattered signal
   from the Earth over a continuous, 1800-km-wide swath centered on the
   subsatellite track. The surface normalized radar cross-section is
   calculated from the backscatter measurements and knowledge of the
   viewing geometry and instrument characteristics. Over the ocean, the
   received power results primarily from scattering from centimitric ocean
   roughness elements whose amplitudes and directional distributions are
   in equilibrium with the local wind; thus backscattered power varies as
   a function of wind speed and direction relative to the radar beam.
   Multiple, near-simultaneous measurements of normalized radar
   cross-section obtained from the same location, but from different
   viewing directions and incident angles, are combined with an empirical
   model function relating backscatter cross-section to wind conditions to
   allow calculation of near-surface wind speed and direction over the
   ice-free oceans.

   OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVE:

              Improve weather forecasts near coastlines by using wind data in
              numerical weather- and wave-prediction models.
