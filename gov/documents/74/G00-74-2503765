                      HRSA's Freedom of Information Act
                                  Home Page

   Within the HRSA Web site you will find a wealth of public information
   available at your fingertips. You will be able to review it on-line or
   download it for future use. You can use our search engine to help you
   find what you're looking for.

   If you check all these resources for public information but you still
   don't see what you need, then you can consider filing a Freedom of
   Information Act (FOIA) request. The Freedom of Information Act, Title 5
   of the United States Code, section 552, is a federal statute which
   affords any person the right to obtain federal agency records, unless
   the records (or a part of the records) are protected from disclosure by
   any of the nine exemptions contained in the law. On October 2, 1996,
   the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996 (E-FOIA,
   for short) was signed into law. E-FOIA makes it possible for you to
   have electronic access to important information in HRSA's Electronic
   Reading Room.

   This home page will help you understand how the FOIA can be used to
   obtain information which is not otherwise publicly available. If you
   wish to visit HRSA's FOIA Public Reading Room in person, it is located
   at:
     * Freedom of Information office, HRSA, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 14-15,
       Rockville, MD 20857
