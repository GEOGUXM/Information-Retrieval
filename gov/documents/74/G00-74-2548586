   Introduction:

   Supply Chain analysis involves working across multiple enterprises or
   companies (Inter-enterprise) to shorten the supply chain time in the
   delivery of goods and services to the consumer or customer.  We are
   also applying this technology to supply chains involving multiple sites
   within the Defense Programs of the Department of Energy (DOE).

   Demand uncertainty in supply chains can be addresses by faster response
   times as shown in the figure below. A basic product supply chain can
   afford longer lead times and batch manufacturing of large lot sizes to
   meet the demand. A supply chain that produces fashion or mass
   customization products must respond quickly and be more agile. Most
   supply chains are moving in the direction to support a more rapid
   changing of demand by the consumer or customer.

         Agile supply chains can respond to more demand uncertainty.

   Benefits:
     *  Shorting of the pipeline or supply chain
     *  Reducing inventories
     *  Improved forecasting
     *  Improved scheduling and planning
     *  Increased turns

   Capabilities:

   We have developed a number of tools for supply chain analysis involving
   the following areas:
     * Secure sharing of data over the Internet
     * Inventory analysis
     * Scheduling
     * Advanced planning
     * Supply chain analysis
     * Sourcing decisions using simulations
     * Inter-Enterprise Architecture

   Sandia has been working with the Textile industry for the last five
   years on supply chain issues as part of the Demand Activated
   Manufacturing Architecture (DAMA) Project. DAMA is part of the American
   Textile (AMTEX) Partnership
