     Welcome to the FBI Philadelphia Division's web site. The purpose of
   this site is to provide information to the public regarding the FBI
   mission in central and eastern Pennsylvania and South Jersey, how to
   contact us, and to serve as a source of data.

   Since its founding in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation, the FBI has
   evolved into one of the most respected and sophisticated law
   enforcement agencies in the world. As the primary investigative arm of
   the federal government, the FBI is responsible for enforcing over 260
   federal statutes and for conducting sensitive national security
   investigations.

   FBI activities include investigations into organized crime,
   white-collar crime, public corruption, financial crime, fraud against
   the government, bribery, copyright matters, civil rights violations,
   bank robbery, extortion, kidnapping, air piracy, terrorism, foreign
   counterintelligence, interstate criminal activity, fugitive and
   drug-trafficking matters, and other violations of federal statutes.

   The FBI also works with other federal, state and local law enforcement
   agencies in investigating matters of joint interest and in training law
   enforcement officers at the FBI Academy.
