   Messaging and Directory Services

   Contact: Gary McCarty

   MDS grew out of the need for easy, reliable, and cost effective
   Department-wide communications and standards.
   Given the many operating administrations that comprise USDOT, each with
   their own email systems and standards, the need for an enterprise
   directory for email became apparent. The department now has a standards
   based enterprise directory with over 100,000 entries capable of
   providing all manner of information. The centrally located directory is
   able to provide a complete picture of people, resources, processes,
   rules, security, and other key data in a single repository.

   An operational enterprise directory enabled MDS to run Mail*Hub.
   Mail*Hub is a standards based email backbone routing service. It
   replaces the role of gateways and manual directory synchronizations
   between disparate mail systems (Groupwise, cc:Mail, Lotus Domino, MS
   Mail, MS Exchange, etc). It converts messages and native address books
   to proper target formats and provides a central management point of
   directory synchronizations, inter-organizational email, and
   Departmental email to and from the world. The advent of GDS and
   Mail*Hub has been a success story for USDOT. Any USDOT user can find
   any other user in their native address book, ensuring easy and reliable
   Department wide emails.

   Building upon their experience the MDS now offers the next step in
   enterprise communications services, known as Mail*Store. Mail*Store is
   a highly reliable Internet-based (IMAP/POP3) messaging and calendaring
   platform that scales to millions of users and can provide mail boxes
   and calendaring services at one of the lowest costs available in this
   time of tighter resources and greater loads. It benefits from the lower
   costs and higher reliability of being centrally located, while offering
   distributed administration and security functions.

   Both Mail*Hub and Mail*Store take advantage of the enterprise directory
   capabilities provided by MDS.

   Virus protection is a critical part of any communication services and
   MDS has implemented an industry leading virus wall that protects FTP,
   HTTP and SMTP sites. This service is available throughout DOT and to
   MDS external customers that take advantage of MDS hosted services.

   MDS is comprised of a professional staff of email, messaging and
   directory service experts to provide every aspect of intelligent
   communications. The staff has specific experience and training in
   delivering quality electronic messaging systems and directory planning,
   deployment, operations and maintenance services.
