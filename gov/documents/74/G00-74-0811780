   The Transportation and Community and System Preservation Pilot Program
   is a comprehensive initiative of research and grants to investigate the
   relationships between transportation and community and system
   preservation and private sector-based initiatives. States, local
   governments, and metropolitan planning organizations are eligible for
   discretionary grants to plan and implement strategies that improve the
   efficiency of the transportation system; reduce environmental impacts
   of transportation; reduce the need for costly future public
   infrastructure investments; ensure efficient access to jobs, services,
   and centers of trade; and examine private sector development patterns
   and investments that support these goals. A total of $120 million is
   authorized for this program for FY's 1999-2003.

   The TCSP Program is a FHWA program being jointly developed with the
   Federal Transit Administration, the Federal Rail Administration, the
   Office of the Secretary, and the Research and Special Programs/Volpe
   Center within the US Department of Transportation, and the US
   Environmental Protection Agency.
