   As the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service
   NESDIS) heads into the 21st century, the GOES Data Collection System's
   DCS) computers and interfaces are approaching the end of their service
      lives. The DCS Automated Processing System (DAPS II) procurement
    project will replace the current aging DAPS with modern user friendly
   hardware and software to maximize effectiveness and minimize life-cycle
    costs. The DAPS II will enable NESDIS to meet its obligations to the
    domestic and international DCS community and maintain its position as
     the world's premier satellite data collection service. To find out
                   more, please visit the DAPS II website.
