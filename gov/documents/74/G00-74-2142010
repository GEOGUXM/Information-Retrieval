   FMS strives to continually improve the Government's performance by
   managing the financial infrastructure in support of Federal agencies.
   FMS employs advanced technologies and is continuing to improve its
   products and services through initiatives such as Electronic Funds
   Transfer (EFT), the Treasury Offset Program (TOP), Vendor Express, and
   the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). Furthermore, in an
   effort to ensure that it offers the latest in fund transfer
   capabilities, FMS has undertaken an Electronic Money Project to study
   newly emerging transaction technologies.
