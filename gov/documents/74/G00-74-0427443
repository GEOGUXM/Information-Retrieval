   Section 108 Foreign Currency Program
   AGENCY: Foreign Agricultural Service, USDA.
   ACTION: Notice.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SUMMARY: The Foreign Agricultural Service invites proposals from
   interested parties to use certain foreign currencies acquired by the
   United States for activities to expand markets for U.S. agricultural
   commodities and for technical assistance activities.
   FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marketing Operations Staff, Foreign
   Agricultural Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 4932-S, STOP
   1042, 1400 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20250-1042, (202)
   720-4327.
   SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
   Introduction
       The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) will use available
   currencies of the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Sri Lanka, and Tunisia,
   to provide assistance in market development and agricultural technical
   assistance activities. This use of foreign currencies is commonly
   referred to as the ``section 108 foreign currency program.'' These
   foreign currencies were acquired by USDA pursuant to agreements
   made under Title I of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance
   Act of 1954, (Pub. L. 480).
       Title I, Pub. L. 480 authorizes the U.S. government to finance the
   sale and exportation of agricultural commodities to foreign governments
   on concessional terms. Between 1986 and 1991, the U.S. entered into
   various Title I, Pub. L. 480 agreements with foreign governments, on
   terms which allowed repayment to the United States in local currencies.
   Pub. L. 480 authorizes the U.S. government to use these
   foreign currencies to implement market development and agricultural
   technical assistance activities.
       This announcement supersedes all previous announcements regarding
   this program. On February 12, 2001, FAS published a notice in the
   Federal Register (66 FR 9818-9820) inviting proposals to use currencies
   of Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Tunisia for market
   development projects and technical assistance activities. The
   currencies of Costa Rica, which were available under the previous
   announcements, are no longer available. The currencies of Sri Lanka
   have been added to the list.
       FAS must disburse local currencies to program participants, usually
   through the disbursing officer in the U.S. embassy in the country of
   origin. That is, FAS may not convert the local currency to any other
   currency prior to disbursement. Activities funded with section 108
   currencies are not limited to the country where the currency
   originated. It is the responsibility of the recipient to arrange for
   receiving and using the foreign currencies made available, or
   converting the funds to other currencies. At the time of this
   announcement, approximately 28 million Dominican Republic pesos; 210
   million Jamaica dollars; 12 million Tunisia dinars; and 1.7 million Sri
   Lanka rupees are available.
   Proposal Process
       This notice is complemented by concurrent notices announcing four
   other foreign market development programs administered by FAS,
   including the Market Access Program (MAP), the Foreign Market
   Development Cooperator (Cooperator) Program, the Emerging Markets
   Program, and the Quality Samples Program (QSP). The MAP and Cooperator
   Program notices detail a Unified Export Strategy (UES) application
   process which provides a means for interested applicants to submit a
   consolidated and strategically coordinated single proposal that
   incorporates funding requests for any or all of these programs. Some
   applicants to the section 108 foreign currency program, particularly
   those who are applying for funding under more than one program, may
   wish to use the UES application process. The Internet-based UES
   application, including step-by-step instructions for its use, is
   located at the following URL address:
   http://www.fas.usda.gov/cooperators.html. Other applicants,
   particularly those who are applying for funding only under the section
   108 foreign currency program, should follow the application procedures
   contained in this notice. Interested applicants that are unsure of how
   to apply are urged to contact the Marketing Operations Staff at the
   address or phone number above.
       FAS recommends that proposals to participate in the section 108
   foreign currency program contain, at a minimum, the following:
       (a) Organizational information, including:
        Organization's name, address, Chief Executive Officer (or
   designee), and Federal Tax Identification Number (TIN);
       Type of organization, e.g., corporation, non-profit organization;
       Name, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address of the
   primary contact person;
       If a trade organization, a description of the organization and its
   membership;
       A description of the organization's prior export promotion
   experience; and
       A description of the organization's experience in implementing a
   trade or technical assistance activity;
       (b) Market information, including:
       An assessment of the targeted market;
       A long-term strategy in the market; and
       U.S. export value/volume and market share data and goals for
   1999-2004;
       (c) Project information, including:
       A brief project title;
       Request for funding in one of the available foreign currencies;
       A brief description of the specific market development trade
   constraint to be addressed by the project, performance measures for the
   years 2002-2004 which will be used to measure the effectiveness of the
   project, a benchmark performance measure for 2002, the viability of
   long term sales to this market, the goals of the project, and the
   expected benefits to the represented industry;
       A method for evaluating and reporting results;
       A description of the activities planned to address the constraint;
   and
       An itemized list of all estimated costs associated with each
   project activity for which reimbursement will be sought;
       (d) Information indicating all funding sources and amounts to be
   contributed by each entity that will supplement implementation of the
   proposed project. This may include the organization that submitted the
   proposal, private industry entities, host governments, foreign third
   parties, Commodity Credit Corporation, FAS, or other Federal agencies.
   Contributed resources may include cash, goods, and services; and,
   (e) A completed Standard Form 424 (SF-424). This form is available on
   the Internet via the section 108 fact sheet at the following URL
   address: http://www.fas.usda.gov/info/factsheets/108fact.htm, or by
   calling the contact listed above.
   Review Process and Allocation Criteria
       The FAS allocates funds in a manner which effectively supports the
   strategic decision-making initiatives of the Government Performance and
   Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 and the USDA's Food and Agricultural Policy
   (FAP). In deciding whether a proposed project will contribute to the
   effective creation, expansion, or maintenance of foreign markets, the
   FAS seeks to identify a clear, long-term agricultural trade strategy
   and a program effectiveness time line against which results can be
   measured at specific intervals using quantifiable product or country
   goals. The FAS also considers the extent to which a proposed project
   targets markets with the greatest growth potential. These factors are
   part of the FAS resource allocation strategy to fund applicants who can
   demonstrate performance and address the objectives of the GPRA and FAP.
   FAS will provide financial assistance under this program on a
   competitive basis and applications will be reviewed against the
   evaluation criteria contained herein. Proposals will be evaluated by
   the applicable FAS commodity division. The divisions will recommend
   funding levels for each applicant based on a review of the applications
   against the following factors:
       The ability of the organization to provide an experienced staff
   with the requisite technical and trade expertise to execute the
   proposal;
       The funding request and the organization's willingness to
   contribute resources, including cash, goods and services of the U.S.
   industry and foreign third parties;
       The conditions or constraints affecting the level of U.S. exports
   and market share for the agricultural commodities and products;
       The degree to which the proposed project is likely to contribute to
   the creation, expansion, or maintenance of the targeted foreign market;
   and
       The degree to which the organization's proposal is coordinated with
   other private or U.S. government-funded market development projects.
       The purpose of this review is to identify meritorious proposals and
   to suggest an appropriate funding level for each application based upon
   these factors. Meritorious proposals will then be reviewed by
   representatives of each FAS program area for the purpose of allocating
   available funds among the applicants. FAS will prioritize meritorious
   proposals according to the following criteria.
       First priority consideration will be given to proposals which
   target the growth markets listed below. These developing markets
   account for a significant share of world imports of major farm
   commodities and much of the projected long-term growth in global import
   demand. As such, they are expected to be among the most supportive of
   USDA's primary export objective of increasing the U.S. share of world
   agricultural trade. First priority growth markets for allocation of
   section 108 funds: Brazil, countries in Central America, Chile, China,
   Egypt, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Russia, South
   Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam. First priority
   consideration will also be given to proposals which target the
   countries from which the foreign currencies originate, i.e., Dominican
   Republic, Jamaica, Sri Lanka, and Tunisia.
       Second priority consideration will be given to proposals which
   target other markets where growth prospects for the relevant
   agricultural product are high. These proposals would serve to open new
   markets or bring about substantial growth in existing markets.
       In all cases, preference is given to nonprofit U.S. agricultural
   trade organizations that represent an entire industry or are nationwide
   in membership and scope.
       Note: FAS generally reviews section 108 proposals on a quarterly
   basis. However, FAS may also consider proposals on an accelerated basis
   if an urgent marketing opportunity becomes available. FAS will evaluate
   such proposals according to the criteria specified in this notice.
   Details concerning the accelerated review can be obtained from the
   section 108 fact sheet on the Internet at the following URL address:
   http://www.fas.usda.gov/info/factsheets/108fact.htm or by calling the
   contact listed above.
   Agreements
       Following approval of a proposal, FAS will enter into an agreement
   with the organization that submitted the proposal. Agreements will
   incorporate the project details as approved by FAS and specify any
   other terms and conditions applicable to project funding. Agreements
   include the maximum amount of funds, in local currencies rather than
   U.S. dollars, which may be made available for a participant's approved
   activities. All agreements with non-profit organizations under this
   program are administered under 7 CFR part 3019--Uniform Administrative
   Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements with Institutions of
   Higher Education, Hospitals, and other Non-profit Organizations. These
   regulations can be found on the Internet at the following URL address :
   http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx/01/7cfr3019_01.html  .

   Submission of Proposals
       Proposals may be submitted on a continuous basis. However, all
   Internet-based section 108 proposals (using the UES application) must
   be properly submitted by 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, March 11, 2002,
   because the UES entry Web site closes at that time. Signed SF-424 forms
   must be delivered to one of the addresses listed below.
       All proposals on diskette (with two accompanying paper copies and a
   signed SF-424 form) and any other proposals must be delivered to one of
   the following addresses:
