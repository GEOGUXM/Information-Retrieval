Cookie Information

   Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your computer by our
   web site. Cookies can come in two varieties: "file" cookies and
   "temporary" cookies. File cookies are kept on your hard disk for a long
   time, whereas temporary cookies (or "cache" or "memory" cookies) are
   stored instead in your browser memory, and they go away as soon as you
   quit your browser (i.e. temporary cookies NEVER touch your hard disk).

   Our web site uses only temporary cookies. They are used to store your
   username and password once you logon. We also use them to store your
   search criteria in some of the applications. If your browser is
   configured to block temporary cookies, then you will not be able to use
   our site.

   Please read our suggestion on setting up your browser .
