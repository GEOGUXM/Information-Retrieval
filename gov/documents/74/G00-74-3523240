                    Principles of Systems and Cybernetics

   Principles or laws play the role of expressing the most basic ideas in
   a science, establishing a framework or methodology for problem-solving.
   The domain of General Systems and Cybernetics is in particular need of
   such principles, since it purports to guide thought in general, not
   just in a specific discipline. Unfortunately, the few generally used
   principles of the domain, such as the law of requisite variety, or the
   principle that the whole is more than the sum of its parts, are
   typically ambiguous or controversial, and lack coherence with each
   other.

   The heart of the Principia Cybernetica Project lies therefore in the
   establishment of a set of clear and coherent Principles of Cybernetics.
   As Principles, they should have the following properties:

   Primitive:
          The word "principle" is derived from the Latin principes (he who
          goes first) or primo (first). Principles are primary or
          primitive in that something can follow from them. They are the
          beginning to a system of thought, axiomatic (although we want to
          avoid the formal sense of that term).

   Simplicity:
          Principles should be simple almost to the point of being
          self-evident or tautological.

   Universality:
          Principles should have virtually universal applicability within
          the domain of Cybernetics and Systems Science.

   The preliminary set of principles we propose are based on and expressed
   in terms of a set of primitive concepts of systems and cybernetics.
   Some of the principles have a long and venerable tradition in
   Cybernetics and Systems Science, while others are novel to Metasystem
   Transition Theory. Our analysis will on the one hand critically assess
   existing principles, clarifying their meaning, on the other hand try to
   formulate new principles which may generalize or interconnect known
   laws.

   The ultimate goal is to arrive at a network of concepts and principles
   similar to a formal system, with "axioms" implicitly defining primitive
   concepts, definitions of higher order concepts, and "theorems", derived
   from the more primitive axioms and definitions. The fundamental
   principles, like all good axioms, are supposed to be self-evident.
   Their implications, like most theorems, on the other hand, may be far
   from trivial, and sometimes even counter-intuitive.
