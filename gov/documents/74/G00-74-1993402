   There are two options for searching the PrePRINT Network.

   The first, Search All Sites, allows users to search the HTML web pages
   of the sites linked within the PrePRINT Network.  This option returns
   hits for any surface web pages that contain the specified terms.

   The second option, Search Selected Sites, provides simultaneous
   searching across selected preprint databases and servers.  The PrePRINT
   Network pulses the search engines of each large preprint database and
   returns a compiled results list to the user.
