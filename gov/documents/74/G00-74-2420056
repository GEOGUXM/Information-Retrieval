                             GENERAL INFORMATION

        Alcaligenes eutrophus CH34, recently renamed Ralstonia eutrophus
   is a gram-negative, non-spore forming bacterium which thrives in the
   presence of millimolar concentrations of several heavy-metals (Zn, Cd,
   Co,Pb,Hg, Ni & Cr). The heavy-metal resistance is conferred by two
   large megaplasmids (pMOL28=180 kbp and pMOL30=240 kbp) carrying gene
   clusters that encode cation-efflux machinery spanning both bacterial
   membranes. These low-copy number plasmids are stably maintained in the
   presence or absence of selective pressure and are self-transferable at
   relatively low frequencies.

        A. eutrophus uses a variety of substrates as its carbon source or
   it can grow chemo-lithotropically using molecular hydrogen as the
   energy source and carbon dioxide as a carbon source. When nitrate is
   present A. eutrophus can grow anaerobically.

        Regions of the megaplasmid DNA relevant to the cation-efflux pump
   were sequenced; however, to the best of our knowledge, none of the
   groups is systematically sequencing any of the plasmids. The complete
   sequence of the megaplasmids will be instrumental in understanding gene
   organization, especially mechanism of plasmid replication, partition
   and transfer, and allowing the construction of environmentally-friendly
   bacteria e.g. E.coli with stable and efficient mechanism for
   heavy-metal resistance.

                      GOALS AND SEQUENCING INFORMATION

   In collaboration with Dr. M. Mergeay mergeaym@vito.be and Dr. D. van
   der Lelie vdlelied@vito.be we set out to accomplish in the first phase
   the following goals:
    1. Complete the sequence of the entire megaplasmid pMOL28 (160 kbp)
       and pMOL30 (240 kbp) using both standard approach (shotgun) and
       more directed high-throughput strategies developed in our group.
    2. Analyze the plasmid nucleotide sequences to locate all genes/gene
       families, particularly those responsible for heavy heavy-metal
       resistance. Of interest will also be, any genetic regulatory
       elements like replication origins, partition loci, plasmid
       maintenance, etc.
    3. Locate and remove/modify the regions of plasmid responsible for
       transfer to prevent plasmid spontaneous plasmid exchange under
       natural conditions.

   Note: Initially we started sequencing on the libraries prepared from
   DNA isolated from wild type CH34 strain which has two megaplasmids.
   Later on we obtained cured strains with one (pMOL28) or another
   (pMOL30) plasmids. In addition some sequencing was done on a plasmid
   which has approximately 40,000 bases of chromosomal DNA incorporated
   into pMOL28 (called pMOL50=strain AE3).

   Partial list of long-term goals includes:
    1. Solve the structure of antiporters membrane proteins using X-ray
       crystallography.
    2. Use site-directed mutagenesis to locate key amino acid determinants
       of heavy-metal resistance and selectivity.
    3. Modify and/or broaden the metal selectivity through amino acid
       substitution.

   Some of the genes located in CH34 megaplasmids are shown below in table
   1 .
