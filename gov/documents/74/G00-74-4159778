   Search Basics
   The Office of Administrative Law Judges uses Verity search software.
   The following is a brief overview of the most basic search operators
   available for use in Verity. See the Search Tips Manual for more detail
   and information on other search operators and strategies.
   BASIC OPERATORS: AND, OR, NOT

   Sample: repetitive AND stress NOT disorder

          searches for documents with the words repetitive and stress, but
          not disorder

   Note: use commas as alternative to the OR operator
   Sample: repetitive, stress, disorder

          searches for documents with the words repetitive or stress or
          disorder

   PROXIMITY SEARCH OPERATORS: <PARAGRAPH>, <SENTENCE>, <NEAR>, <NEAR/N>

   Sample: repetitive <NEAR/3> disorder

          searches for documents with the word repetitive within three
          words of disorder

   Note: These operators require that you place angle brackets ( < > )
   around the operator
   EXACT WORD OR PHRASE: use quotation marks

   Sample: "repetitive stress disorder"

          searches for the exact phrase repetitive stress disorder

   Sample: "stress"

          searches for the word stress, and will not return stresses or
          other stemmed variations

   Note: Verity interprets as string of words as a request for a search
   for a phrase
   Sample: repetitive stress disorder

          searches for the phrase, but will also search for stemmed
          variations (e.g., stress and stresses)

   WILDCARDS: *, ?

   Sample: disabl*

          Searches for any word starting with the letters disabl

   Sample: fl??ss

          search finds pages that contain, for example, either Fleiss or
          Fliess.

   RESERVED CHARACTERS: , ( ) [ = > < ! @ ` < { [ !

   The characters above are used by the search software. Thus, to search
   for a string tha contains one of these characters, precede the
   character with a backslash.

   Sample: rick\'s cafe

          Searches for Rick's cafe
