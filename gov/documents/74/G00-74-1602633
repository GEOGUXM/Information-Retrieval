             The 4th rendezvous and docking with the Russian Mir space
             station and the exchange of astronauts -- including the holder
             of the world record for longest space flight ever by a U.S.
             astronaut -- will highlight the flight of Space Shuttle Atlantis
             on Mission STS-79. This is the fourth of nine planned missions
             to Mir between 1995 and 1998 and the first exchange of
             astronauts. Astronaut Shannon W. Lucid, who has been on Mir
             since late March, will be replaced on Mir by astronaut John E.
             Blaha. Blaha will spend more than four months on Mir. He will
             return to Earth on Space Shuttle Mission STS-81, scheduled for
             launch in January 1997.

             STS-79 is the second Shuttle-Mir mission to carry a SPACEHAB
             module on board, and the first to carry a double module. The
             forward portion of the double module will house experiments
             conducted by the crew before, during and after Atlantis is
             docked to the Russian space station. The aft portion of the
             double module primarily houses the logistics equipment to be
             transferred to the Russian space station. Logistics include
             food, clothing, experiment supplies, and spare equipment for
             Mir.

   Launch:

             Launch September 16, 1996. 4:54:49.048 am Window was
             approximately 5 min.
             On Monday, September 16, 1996, the astronauts were awakened in
             the crew quarters at midnight and after breakfast departed for
             the pad at 1:08am. The countdown proceeded smoothly. Liftoff was
             on time. MECO occured ontime. No OMS-1 burn required. APU-2
             shutdown slightly early during ascent and is being investigated.

             On Saturday, September 14, 1996, activities were underway to
             install time-critical experiments and other items designated for
             late-stowage into the SPACEHAB Double Module in the payload bay.
             Loading of fuels into the Space Shuttle external tank started at
             approximately 7:30 p.m. on Sunday night.
             (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 9/14/1996).

             The countdown for the launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis began on
             Friday, Sept. 13 around 12 am. (midnight) at the T-43 hour mark.
             The KSC launch team is conducting the countdown from Firing Room
             1 of the Launch Control Center (LCC). The countdown includes 33
             hours and 53 minutes of built-in hold time. (Reference KSC Press
             Release 105-96). Crew arrived at KSC around midnight Sept 13 and
             RSS retract at 11am on Sept 15th. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             9/12/1996).

             At 5:21am EDT on September 4, 1996, Space Shuttle Atlantis was
             rolled back to the VAB due to the possibility of high winds from
             Hurricane Fran (Reference KSC Weather History 09/04/1996 1100).
             Atlantis was securely back in the VAB by 11:30am. The next day
             on September 5, the Space Shuttle Atlantis was returned to Pad
             39A following mission managers determination that the threat of
             Hurricane Fran to central Florida had passed. First motion from
             the Vehicle Assembly Building back to the pad occurred at about
             2:51 a.m. The vehicle was hard-down on the pad at about 8:30
             a.m. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 9/05/1996).
             On Thursday, August 29, 1996, following the flight readiness
             review, Space Shuttle managers set Sept 14 as the launch date
             for Atlantis. However officials were keeping a close eye on
             tropical storm activity in the Atlantic and plans were being
             developed to rollback Atlantis to the VAB if any storms turn
             toward the Kennedy Space Center. (Reference KSC Press Release
             101-96)

             During the meeting, solid rocket motor managers presented data
             on the abnormal sooting discovered in the J-leg tip on the
             STS-78 solid rocket motor field joints following Columbia's
             launch in June. An analysis showed that the most probable cause
             for the sooting was a new adhesive used in the field joints for
             the first time on STS-78. Managers decided to take a
             conservative approach and replace the STS-79 motors with a new
             set using the old adhesive material. NASA managers said a
             thorough review of Atlantis' new solid rocket motors verified
             their readiness for launch.

             On Tuesday, August 13, 1996, Atlantis was moved from Orbiter
             Processing Facility (OPF) bay 3 to the Vehicle Assembly Building
             (VAB) with first motion occuring at about 10:45 a.m. (Reference
             KSC Shuttle Status 8/13/1996).

             On Thursday, August 8, 1996, STS-79's external tank was demated
             from STS-79's original set of SRBs. A new set of SRB's has
             already been stacked and destacking of the original SRB is
             expected to begin on Monday. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             8/08/1996).

             On Friday, August 2, 1996, Atlantis was demated from the
             original set of SRB's and transported to the OPF bay no. 3 at
             about 2 AM Saturday. STS-79's original SRBs are scheduled to be
             used on mission STS-81 after they are destacked, cleaned,
             inspected and restacked. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             8/05/1996).

             On Monday, July 29, 1996, Atlantis remained in the VAB while
             stacking operations of the replacement set of SRB's continued in
             the adjacent high bay. Following a failed leak check on July 25,
             1996 of field joint between the right aft center and right
             forward center segments of the replacement SRBs, the forward
             center segment was destacked and cleaned. During inspections of
             the secondary O-rings, an applicator brush bristle was found and
             is believed to be the reason for the field joint leakage. New
             O-rings were installed and the segment was restacked. A leak
             check is being conducted today. If the leak check is successful,
             booster stacking will be completed this week and the external
             tank mated to the stack as early as Friday. (Reference KSC
             Shuttle Status 7/29/1996)

             On Monday, July 15, 1996, NASA managers decided to destack and
             replace Atlantis' Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB) with a new set of
             boosters. Technicians disassembling the motors of Space Shuttle
             mission STS-78 observed that hot gases had seeped into J-joints
             in the field joints of the motors. An investigation into the
             seepage identified the most probable cause was the use of a new
             adhesive and cleaning fluid. These elements were changed in
             order to comply with new Environmental Protection Agency
             regulations which reduce ozone depleting substances. The STS-79
             booster set included the same adhesive so a new SRB stack built
             using the older adhesive will be used until the problem can be
             further analyzed. (Reference NASA Press Release 96-138)

             On Tuesday, 7/9/96, Mission managers decided to roll back
             Atlantis from Pad LC-39A to the VAB due to the projected storm
             track of Hurricane Bertha. The shuttle has been rolled back from
             the launch pad due to weather twice previously. Columbia
             (STS-35) was rolled back in October 1990 due to Tropical Storm
             Klaus and Endeavour (STS-69) was rolled back in August 1995 due
             to Hurricane Erin. This was the 11th rollback in the shuttles
             operational history. The original launch date of July 31, 1996
             at 11:42pm EDT has been moved back to sometime mid September.
             Atlantis will be destacked from its

             Earlier in the week a rollback was also being considered in the
             event repairs will be needed to the Shuttle Solid Rocket
             Boosters (SRB) following the discovery of hot gas penetration of
             rubber insulation on the boosters for shuttle flight STS-78.

             On 7/1/96, Atlantis was rolled out from the VAB to Pad 39A with
             first motion occurring at 10:20 p.m. on 6/30/96. The vehicle was
             hard down on the pad by 5 a.m. A hot fire of the No. 3 Auxiliary
             Power Unit (APU) was then performed and then the Rotating
             Service Structure (RSS) was rolled into position around the
             orbiter. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 7/01/1996)

             On 6/3/96, in OPF Bay-1, work was completed to remove, replace
             and retest six of Atlantis' reaction control system (RCS)
             thrusters. All three main engines are also installed. In the
             VAB, the external tank will be mated to the SRBs on 6/6/96.
             (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 6/03/1996)

             On 4/17/96, in OPF Bay-1, the ferry flight tail cone was
             removed. On 4/18/96 the SPACEHAB-MIR double module was removed
             as well as the Waste Containment System (WCS) and the Reaction
             Control System (RCS) (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 4/18/1996)

   Landing:

             KSC September 26, 1996 at 8:13:20am EDT. Runway 15. A go was
             given at 6:52am EDT for deorbit burn and the 3min 17sec burn
             occurred at 7:06am EDT on orbit 160 at a mission elapsed time of
             10days, 3 hours, 18 minutes. Atlantis landed on KSC's 1st
             Opportunity landing track which followed the eastern seaboard of
             Georgia and Florida. Main Gear Touchdown was at 8:13:15 EDT
             (10days 3hr 18min 26sec), Nose gear touchdown at 8:13:29 EDT
             (10days 3hr 18min 40sec) and wheels stop at 8:14:17 EDT (10days
             3hr 19min 28sec).
             The two KSC landing opportunities on Thursday were 8:11 a.m. and
             9:48 a.m. In the event a landing was not possible at KSC on
             Thursday due to weather concerns, a landing could have been made
             at Edwards Air Force Base (EAFB), CA. Landing opportunities at
             Edwards on Thursday were at 9:40 a.m. and 11:16 a.m. EDT. If
             managers decided to keep Atlantis in orbit an additional day,
             two landing opportunities were also available at KSC and two at
             Edwards on Friday. KSC Friday landing times were 8:46 a.m. and
             10:22 a.m. EDT. EAFB Friday landing times were 10:15 a.m. and
             11:51 a.m. EDT. (Reference KSC Press Release 111-96)
