                 The Screwworm Fly Simulation Model (SWFSIM)
   _______________________________________________________________________

    A computer model, SWFSIM (Screwworm Fly Simulation), has been
   developed for simulation of population dynamics of Cochliomyia
   hominivorax on a world-wide basis.  The model uses a complex, dynamic
   life table approach with daily age classes and time steps and is
   spatially homogenous.  Myiasis development in individual hosts is
   simulated using stochastic procedures for host finding,
   detection/treatment of hosts and host death for a fixed area of 100 sq
   km with a discrete number of hosts.  Seasonal population dynamics are
   simulated by varying major biological parameters (survival, development
   and host finding) with weather data (temperature, saturation deficit
   and rainfall).  Other location specific variables  include host
   density,  proportion of hosts that are domestic, wound rate and  wound
   treatment rate.  Fly density estimates for Costa Rica and case report
   data for Texas, Mexico and Libya were used for model calibration and
   verification.  The model produces realistic simulations of seasonal
   dynamics for locations with widely different weather patterns using a
   fixed set of biological parameters.

    SWFSIM is an information and analysis system that operates
   interactively on a DOS based personal or laptop computer.  The system
   provides a prediction of population dynamics and the effect of control
   efforts in areas where eradication is planned or areas subject to
   accidental introduction or outbreaks.

    Current research with SWFSIM involves validation comparisons with
   population dynamics data for Panama.  Future development of this model
   will include integration with geographic information system (GIS) and
   remote sensing studies.
