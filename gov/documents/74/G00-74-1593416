   On this page we'll give images and movies of recent storms. Most of
   these products are used by us in making presentation materials and so
   are higher resolution. We apologized for the size of these products,
   but was have no other choice

                                   Miscellany

   Here I'll post images and animations that aren't covered under the
   other two categories. I've been doing some work with other members of
   the QuikSCAT team on combining different measurements into one image or
   animation, for instance, radar backscatter on the land with wind fields
   over the ocean. I'll post interesting examples of this work here.

Combination Images, Radar backscatter on land/Wind field over ocean

   Here are two images which combine land and water data. The land data
   shows areas that are moist as red and dry areas as blue. (The smaller
   the backscatter, the drier) The wind data shows the prevailing winds at
   the time given at the bottom of the picture, the directions are
   indicated by the arrows and the speed by the color contours. These two
   images are 6 months apart in time and the notable difference in them is
   the position of the red/brown line just south of the Sahara. You'll
   notice that it shifts southward quite a few degrees in the later view,
   showing the effect of the changing monsoon patterns. These images are
   quite large, so the full sized view will take a while to download.
