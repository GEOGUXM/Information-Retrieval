   Southern Highlands and Mississippi Valley Soil Survey
   Region 16

        Soil Survey Region 16 located in Little Rock, Arkansas, is one of
   17 Soil Survey Region Offices serving the National Cooperative Soil
   Survey (NCSS) in the United States and its trust territories.  Region
   16 consists of 9 Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) within the Southern
   Highlands and Mississippi Valley.  A MLRA is a physiographic region
   that is similar in climate, topography, water resources, land use, and
   pattern of soils.
        Soil Survey Region 16 provides assistance to project soil survey
   offices located in Arkansas and portions of Kentucky, Louisiana,
   Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas.
       Soil Survey Region 16 provides quality assurance, technical
   guidance and support, and soil technology transfer to NCSS project
   offices in the Southern Highlands and Mississippi Valley Soil Survey
   Region. Region 16 is committed to producing high-quality soil surveys
   within the region by completing surveys in those areas not having a
   soil survey, by coordinating and updating all soil surveys in the
   region to a common standard across state boundaries, and by exploring
   new ways to provide soils information to our clients.
       Soil Survey Region 16 is divided into 9 MLRAs with 25 active
   ongoing soil surveys, of which 20 are initial surveys and 5 are
   updates.  These projects consist of a single county, or in some
   instances, multiple counties which are subsets of Major Land Resource
   Areas.   Agriculture Handbook 296, "Land Resource Regions and Major
   Land Resource Areas of the United States," provides information about
   MLRAs.
