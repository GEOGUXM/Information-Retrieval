   Remote-Control Microscopy

   Remote-control microscopy was initiated at the NCEM using the Kratos
   EM-1500 as a test-bed in 1994 [1] as a joint project with a group
   within LBNL's Division of Information and Computer Sciences. The
   project is continuing, using expertise from both the NCEM and ICSD .

   To control the Kratos EM-1500, the remote user uses a graphical user
   interface running on his/her remote workstation. Controls include the
   tilt and translation of the microscope stage and objective lens
   defocus. Control of image magnification and beam alignment awaits the
   installation of a CCD camera on the Kratos.

   Control of the Kratos is achieved by accepting remote commands received
   by the SunÂ™ workstation and passing them on to a Pentium PC controlling
   D/A cards that drive the Kratos controls directly [2] (pdf - 5 MB).

   Materials MicroCharacterization Collaboratory

   NCEM is a member of the Materials MicroCharacterization Collaboratory,
   a pilot project for DOE2000. DOE2000 is an initiative to fundamentally
   change the way scientists work together and how they address the major
   challenges of scientific computation. DOE2000 will develop and explore
   new computational tools and libraries that advance the concept of
   "national collaboratories" and Advanced Computational Testing and
   Simulation (ACTS). The MMC [5,6] is one of two collaboratories funded
   by DOE2000., and includes facilities at the five laboratories shown on
   the map. Click on the map to gain access to live video from each member
   site.

   NCEM has designated the Kratos as a facility available via the
   Materials Microcharacterization Collaboratory and will make the
   CM300FEGUT available as an MMC facility once it is on-line [7].
