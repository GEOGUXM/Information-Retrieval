      The GTE bibliography has now been updated.  The bibliography consists
      of citations for publications, presentations, and media coverage and
      has been significantly updated since the re-initial issue in March
      1997.  The citations are arranged by mission to facilitate identifying
      the time period, science subject and repository of the data referred to
      in the citation.  We have limited the citations to those actually using
      GTE data or dealing in some other way with a GTE mission.  The list is
      extensive and impressive.

      There is no better way to show the scientific impact of the GTE program
      than a bibliography such as this.  This bibliography update may have
      inadvertently omitted some important publication or presentation you
      have made in the past.  Please provide us the appropriate information
      to allow its inclusion in the next update.  Any additions or
      corrections should be sent to Mary M. Kleb (Mail Stop 401B, NASA
      Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA 23681-2199, or
      m.m.kleb@larc.nasa.gov).  Whenever you publish or present a paper in
      the future, please send Mary Kleb a copy so that its citation will be
      included in the next bibliography update. Bibliography accuracy will be
      best served by sending us your citation information  after it has been
      presented or published.

      Remember the availability of all the GTE science measurements from all
      the missions. Currently, the data are available by ftp from the GTE
      archive.  The server is ftp-gte.larc.nasa.gov/pub ,the user is
      anonymous, and the password is your e-mail name.  Sequential selections
      will present each mission, each platform and type of data, each PI in a
      mission, and each flight in the mission.  In addition, we maintain a
      GTE WEB (www-gte.larc.nasa.gov) page to provide alternative data access
      as well as background information for GTE and each mission.  The GTE
      data are also available via the EOS DAACs
