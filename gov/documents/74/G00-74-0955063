                         About Energy End-Use Forecasting

   Research Focus

        Work conducted by this team falls into five broad subject areas:
        * Assisting policymakers in program design, implementation, and
          evaluation;
        * Assessing the effects of existing or proposed policies on energy
          service markets;
        * Compiling technology and market data into widely-cited reference
          reports;
        * Comparing forecasting results from different models;
        * Improving current forecasting methodologies to reflect the
          state-of-the-art.

        The demand-side reports and analyses produced by this team cover all
        major end-uses in residential and commercial buildings,
        incorporating data on technology performance, equipment ownership,
        costs, building shell characteristics, climate, real-world program
        experience, and consumer behavior. Other analyses assess specific
        policy questions in depth, drawing upon technology data and modeling
        as needed. These other analyses span demand and supply sectors, and
        include assessments of electricity supply-side technologies, ENERGY
        STAR voluntary programs, minimum efficiency standards, tax credits,
        market imperfections, technology adoption, and costs of carbon
        reductions.

        The two main clients for End-Use Forecasting are the U.S.
        Environmental Protection Agency (Atmospheric Pollution Prevention
        Division) and the U.S. Department of Energy (Energy Efficiency and
        Renewable Energy).
