National Plan for The Centennial of Flight Commemoration

   "Born of dreams. Inspired by freedom. These words lie at the heart of
   the U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission's outreach efforts. Through
   publication of a strategic plan, the Commission hopes to encourage
   national and international appreciation and celebration of the 100th
   anniversary of flight in a fashion that inspires vision, persistence,
   and creativity in a future generation of inventors."

   These words are taken from a letter from J. R. Dailey, Chairman, U.S.
   Centennial of Flight Commission, to the Honorable Richard B. Cheney,
   President of the Senate, transmitting the National Plan for The
   Centennial of Flight Commemoration. The Commission's National Plan is
   provided in online web format, as well as a printable Adobe Acrobat
   document.

                       The Honorable Richard B. Cheney
                      Letter to President of the Senate
