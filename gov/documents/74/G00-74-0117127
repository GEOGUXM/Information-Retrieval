                              Cosmic Dust Grain

   Many tons of dust grains, including samples of asteroids and comets,
   fall from space onto the Earth's atmosphere each day. An even larger
   amount of spacecraft debris particulates reenter the Earth's atmosphere
   every day. Once in the stratosphere this "cosmic dust" and spacecraft
   debris joins terrestrial particles such as volcanic ash, windborne
   desert dust and pollen grains. High flying aircraft with special sticky
   collectors capture this dust as it falls through the stratosphere,
   before it becomes mixed with Earth dust. The ultra-clean Cosmic Dust
   Laboratory, established in 1981 to handle particles one-tenth the
   diameter of a human hair, curates over 2000 cosmic dust particles and
   distributes samples to over 30 investigators.

   Cosmic dust grains include our only samples from comets, probably
   containing material in the same condition as when the solar system
   began to form. Examination of cosmic dust reveals much about the
   populations of interplanetary dust and orbital debris particles. Such
   information is useful to engineers planning proctection of Space
   Station against damage from high-velocity dust grains. The terrestrial
   dust and spacecraft debris particles are of considerable interest to
   atmospheric scientists and climatologists, since they influence some
   global atmospheric reactions.
