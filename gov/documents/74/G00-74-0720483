   SENATOR TOM HARKIN RESPONDS TO PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
   TUESDAY, JANUARY 29, 2002
   WASHINGTON -- "America is united and stands solidly behind the
   president in the fight against terrorism. Ive been proud to work with
   the president to pass a tough airline security bill and to improve
   homeland defense and protect against bioterrorism. Weve shown the world
   that when America comes together, theres nothing we cant do.

   "Now we need to apply that same bi-partisan spirit to meet our
   challenges here at home. There is a lot that we can agree on and I'm
   hopeful that we can work together to accomplish as much as possible for
   the American people.

   "We have to get the economy back on track. For rural and small town
   America, the new farm bill is key to that economic recovery. Im looking
   forward to working with the president to pass the farm bill to raise
   farm income and expand opportunity in places like Iowa.

   "We need to continue our bipartisan education reform efforts with a
   focus on early childhood. We need to work together to provide a
   prescription drug benefit for all of our seniors. We must do all we can
   to make sure that American workers pensions are protected. And we must
   do the right thing and pass meaningful campaign finance and election
   reform.

   "I am particularly looking forward to working with the president on
   welfare reform. I was proud to fight for a tough welfare reform law six
   years ago and we need to continue to make sure that welfare is a
   hand-up, not a hand-out.

   "I am hopeful that the new year will begin a renewed commitment from
   the president to finding bipartisan solutions to our domestic
   challenges. We've got to come together, to collaborate, and to move
   this country in the right direction. We can do it."
