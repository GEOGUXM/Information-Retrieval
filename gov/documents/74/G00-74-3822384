   Mars Global Surveyor MAG/ER

                The MGS Magnetometer and Electron Reflectometer

   The magnetometer and electron reflectometer instruments are attempting
   to measure the poorly understood global magnetic properties of Mars. On
   Earth, a magnetic field surrounds the planet. The magnetism results
   from electric currents circulating in the molten iron churning slowly
   in the Earth's core. Magnetic fields are usually measured in units of
   "gamma", for our purposes we use the "nanoTesla" unit.

   Unlike the other instruments, the magnetometer sensors are not attached
   to the main body of the spacecraft. Instead, each one of the two
   sensors sits at opposite ends of the spacecraft at the tips of
   Surveyor's two solar panels. This placement ensures that the data
   generated from the magnetometer sensors will not be "polluted" by
   magnetic signals from the spacecraft system.

   The electron reflectometer sensor is mounted on the instrument platform
   because it is not sensitive to weak magnetic fields. The magnetometer
   and electron reflectometer were operational during the cruise phase of
   the mission. During the aerobraking phase the MGS spacecraft crossed
   the Martian bow shock formed by the supersonic interaction of the
   planet with the solar wind at least twice per orbit. The MAG/ER
   detected these crossing and generated valuable data for determining the
   global extent of the Martian magnetic field. During the mapping orbit,
   the MAG/ER is operating continuously - and will continue to do so for a
   total of at least one Martian year (687 days) - obtaining detailed maps
   of the interior and crustal magnetic fields of Mars.

Fluxgate (Saturable-Core) Magnetometer

   The fluxgate magnetometers implemented for the Mars Global Surveyor are
   based on similar instruments developed for numerous previous missions
   (Voyager, Magsat, International Solar Polar mission, Giotto, Active
   Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Explorers, etc.). The basic
   configuration consists of dual; wide-range, triaxial flux gate sensors
   mounted remote from the spacecraft's body. Assuming that this field is
   primarily dipolar in nature at the location of the magnetometer
   sensors, the ambient field can then be analytically determined by
   combining the outboard and inboard measurements.

   In a magnetometer of this type, the nonlinearity of magnetization
   properties for the high permeability of easily saturated ferromagnetic
   alloys provides an indicator of the local field strength. The word
   "fluxgate" is used to refer to the method of periodic switching of
   magnetic flux in the detector.

   For taking measurements of weak magnetic fields, enhancements are made
   to the second harmonic detection. "In one method, two parallel cores
   are wound in opposing directions in the excitation field circuit, and a
   single secondary coil encompasses both. The two primary contributions
   into the pickup windings are thereby canceled. The example above
   illustrates such a system, which utilizes second harmonic phase
   detection. With specifically selected cores and careful construction,
   sensitivities of a few milligamma have been obtained. In recent years,
   the cores have been fashioned in the shape of a ring, just about a
   centimeter in size, and the excitation and pick up windings have been
   made toroidally about the ring." (Intro to Geomagnetic field, Wallace
   H. Campbell, p. 187).

   The MGS flux gate sensors are constructed utilizing the ring core
   geometry, which has been shown to exhibit superior performance
   characteristics in terms of long-term zero-level stability and drive
   power requirements when compared to other types of flux gate sensors.
   In addition, the magnetic material used to manufacture these sensors is
   the latest in a series of advanced molybdenum-pemalloy alloys, which
   have been especially developed for low-noise, high stability
   applications.

   The signals from the magnetometers are first processed by their
   respective analog electronic subsystems and then fed to the
   digital-processing unit (DPU). Depending on the spacecraft telemetry
   mode, variable time resolution formats are derived from the basic
   measurements. This subsystem also provides the necessary information to
   the microprocessor to activate the automatic range control logic in the
   magnetometer electronics. If the magnitude of the measured vector
   component exceeds reselected threshold values, the dynamic range (scale
   factor) of each magnetometer is incremented or decremented to maintain
   maximum digital resolution.

   Both inboard and outboard magnetometers are sampled at a rate of 32
   samples per second by a clock system derived from the spacecraft data
   system real-time interrupt clock (RTI). These "raw" samples are then
   averaged according to the telemetry mode selected for the spacecraft
   and the data rate allocated to the experiment.
