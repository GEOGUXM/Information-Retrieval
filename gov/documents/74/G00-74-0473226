   The USDA is committed to making its web sites accessible to all USDA
   customers and employees. All of the USDA web sites, including that of
   the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), are undergoing
   review and redesign as necessary to ensure that they meet or exceed the
   requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

   The USDA Office of the Chief Information Officer continues to work on
   making its entire site accessible. Thank you very much for your
   patience through this redesign process. If you have any comments or
   suggestions for improvement, please contact the Web Master of this
   site: Contact Information: ociowebmaster@ociofc.usda.gov or
   970-295-5167.
