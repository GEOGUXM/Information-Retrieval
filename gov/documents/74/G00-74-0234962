   IVD Workshop logo WORKSHOP ON MEASUREMENT TRACEABILITY FOR CLINICAL
   LABORATORY TESTING AND IN VITRO DIAGNOSTIC TEST SYSTEMS

                            November 2 - 3, 2000
                           Gaithersburg, Maryland

   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in
   cooperation with the NCCLS (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory
   Standards) and with the sponsorship of the Centers for Disease Control
   and Prevention (CDC), the Advanced Medical Technology Association
   (AdvaMed), the College of American Pathologists (CAP), and the American
   Association for Clinical Chemistry (AACC), held a workshop on
   measurement traceability for clinical laboratory testing and in vitro
   diagnostic test systems for the IVD industry, professional
   organizations, government, and national and international standards
   developing organizations. The purpose of the workshop was to actively
   involve all interested parties in the solution to establishing the
   means and processes for assuring measurement traceability and reference
   systems for the healthcare community.

                                 Background

   Traceability to internationally recognized and accepted standards is an
   important component in assuring the accuracy and comparability of
   clinical laboratory measurements. In addition, the global marketplace
   is presenting new demands for measurement traceability. NIST has a long
   history of providing such measurement standards in several fields
   including the clinical laboratory community and is continuing its
   efforts to develop new reference methods and materials for important
   health-status markers to meet on-going and future needs for
   traceability. NCCLS is a globally recognized, voluntary consensus
   standards-developing organization that enhances the value of medical
   testing within the healthcare community through the development and
   dissemination of standards, guidelines, and best practices. NCCLS has
   the Secretariat responsibility for the ISO Technical Committee 212
   (ISO/TC 212) on Clinical Laboratory Testing and In Vitro Diagnostic
   Test Systems (TC 212), and is the home of the National Reference System
   for the Clinical Laboratory (NRSCL), a collection of broadly understood
   reference systems intended to improve the comparability of test
   results, consistent with the needs of medical practice. Recently, a new
   opportunity has emerged that applies new pressure on the quest for
   traceability and the demand for reference systems. Prompted by the
   European Union's In Vitro Diagnostics Directive (IVDD), the European
   Committee for Standardization's Technical Committee 140 (CEN/TC 140),
   in vitro diagnostic systems, began drafting a standard on metrological
   traceability. By working closely together, CEN/TC 140 and ISO/TC 212
   will develop identical European and ISO standards on this topic. Full
   implementation of the IVD Directive is expected by December, 2003 and
   will require that calibration of all IVD assays be traceable to the
   highest available reference material or method.

                              Topics Discussed

   The workshop included scientific experts who participated in
   development of the standards for measurement traceability in ISO
   Technical Committee 212 (ISO/TC 212). Speakers discussed the technical
   requirements for establishing measurement traceability, and presented
   practical approaches that manufacturers may follow to satisfy the
   requirements of these ISO standards. Additional presentations focused
   on the state of the art in the calibration of IVD test systems, a
   review of global resources already available to manufacturers, and
   identification of areas for which improvements are needed. Breakout
   sessions were scheduled for participants to discuss reference
   measurement methods, reference materials, and laboratories that perform
   reference measurement procedures. Recommendations were developed to
   address needs in the area of clinical measurement traceability and how
   progress can be accelerated through cooperation among the stakeholders.
   The emphasis was on solutions that are in compliance with international
   standards and industry's needs.

   The "Proceedings of the Workshop on Measurement Traceability for
   Clinical Laboratory Testing and In Vitro Diagnostic Test Systems" is
   now available on CD in PDF format through the Chemical Science and
   Technology Laboratory at NIST. The proceedings documents 10 talks given
   by national and international experts who provided the background and
   current status of the traceability structure for clinical laboratory
   measurements worldwide. It also includes the record of a candid
   discussion of issues and concerns as expressed by stakeholders and
   experts from around the world. There was general consensus among the
   135 participants that healthcare is now more than ever a global issue
   and a global commodity, demanding global solutions. The sense of
   urgency, commitment and dedication of these stakeholders is uniquely
   captured in this workshop record. A PDF (9 megabytes) file is available
   for download. If you have problems obtaining this file by download
