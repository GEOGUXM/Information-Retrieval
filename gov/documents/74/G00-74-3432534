   1. Committee on Dental Auxiliaries Of the Dental Board of California
   Background Information and Overview BACKGROUND AUTHORITY In creating
   the Committee on Dental Auxiliaries (COMDA) in 1974, the Legislature
   intended to permit the full utilization of dental auxiliaries in order
   to meet the dental care needs of all the state's citizens (Section
   1740, Business and Professions Code). Full utilization of auxiliaries
   is generally considered to be the concept of assuring that all possible
   duties are delegated to auxiliaries, consistent with the protection of
   the public health and safety, so that services are accessible to as
   many people as possible. Since COMDA's inception, it performed all of
   the auxiliary examination and licensing functions for the Dental Board
   of California via an administrative agreement between the two entities.
   Following the 1996 Sunset Review of COMDA, the Joint Legislative Sunset
   Review Committee (JLSRC) sponsored successful legislation which granted
   COMDA statutory authority to perform these duties. Separate legislation
   enacted at the same time gave COMDA the authority to evaluate all
   suggestions for regulatory changes, hold informational hearings, and
   request the reasons in writing if the Dental Board rejects or
   significantly modifies any of its recommendations. COMPOSITION COMDA is
   comprised of nine members appointed by the Governor. Legislation was
   enacted in 1998 which changed one of the required Dental Board members
   to a public member of the Dental Board, and removed a requirement that
   one member be an RDAEF or RDHEF. 1 Current COMDA Composition Name

   Governor Wilson either an RDA or RDAEF) Kit Neacy Member of the Dental
   Board (law now states 12/31/02 Governor Wilson that this position must
   be filled by a public member of the Dental Board) Diane Owen Registered
   Dental Assistant 12/31/01 Governor Wilson Douglas Yee Dentist who is
   not a member of the Dental 12/31/01 Governor Wilson Board nor a member
   of the Dental Board's Examining Committee MISSION In fulfilling its
   mission of protecting the health, safety, and welfare of consumers, and
   promoting the full utilization of auxiliaries to meet the dental care
   needs of all of California=s citizens, COMDA has adopted a Strategic
   Plan and the following goals: < support the imposition of the least
   restrictive form of regulation necessary without compromising public
   health, safety, or welfare; < administer fair, and valid examination
   and licensing processes; < assist the Dental Board in its consumer
   protection and enforcement efforts; < foster the accessibility of
   dental health care by supporting scopes or practice and supervision
   levels which allow the most effective utilization of dental
   auxiliaries; < foster the accessibility of dental health care by
   supporting and advocating the existence of a viable career ladder which
   allows the most effective utilization of dental auxiliaries; < support
   efforts to educate consumers in order to improve their dental health; <
   develop and maintain the most flexible, responsive, and cost-effective
   organizational structure possible PROGRAMS There are currently nearly
   45,000 licensed auxiliaries. COMDA examines and licenses five
   categories: ! Registered Dental Assistants (RDAs) ! Registered Dental
   Assistants in Extended Functions (RDAEFs) ! Registered Dental
   Hygienists (RDHs) ! Registered Dental Hygienists in Extended Functions
   (RDHEFs) ! Registered Dental Hygienists in Alternative Practice
   (RDHAPs) AB560 was enacted in 1998, which established a new Registered
   Dental Hygienist in Alternative Practice category of licensure, which
   allows certain persons to practice dental hygiene by prescription from
   a dentist or physician and surgeon in certain settings, rather than
   under the supervision of a licensed dentist. COMDA also maintains
   records of certification of persons who have taken approved courses and
   are, therefore, allowed to perform the following additional duties: !
   Exposure of x-rays on patients ! Coronal polishing ! Ultrasonic scaling
   ! Administration of local anesthetics ! Soft tissue curettage !
   Administration of nitrous oxide and oxygen In addition, COMDA reviews
   sites, curriculum, and other qualifications of those seeking approval
   of the Dental Board to offer Registered Dental Assistant Educational
   Programs, Radiation Safety Programs, Coronal Polishing Courses, and
   Ultrasonic Scaling Courses. Licensing Data FY 1996/97 FY 1997/98 FY

   Note: COMDA does not maintain data on the number of Applications and
   Licenses denied, since all enforcement activity is performed by the
   Dental Board. BUDGET AND STAFF COMDA has an authorized staff of 8.5
   positions, and FY 2000/01 budget of about $1,555,000. All funds are
   derived solely from auxiliary application, examination, and renewal
   fees. They are deposited into the State Dental Auxiliary Fund, a
   special fund separate from the State Dentistry Fund. CURRENT FEE
   SCHEDULE AND RANGE Fees are relatively low, and have essentially been
   stable for many years. Fee Schedule TYPE OF FEE CURRENT FEE STATUTORY

   majority (52%) of COMDA's annual revenue has come from the renewal of
   licenses, which dental licensees must pay every two years on the last
   day of the month of their birthday. During the last four fiscal years,
   an average of 67% of revenue has come from RDA applicants and
   licensees, 30% from RDHs, and 3% from EFs. The primary sources and
   amounts of annual revenue over the past four fiscal years are presented

   $970,585 REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE HISTORY/FUND CONDITION In January,
   1995, the biennial renewal fee was reduced from $40 to $30, which was
   further reduced in April, 1998, to $20 every two years. In order to
   assure a stable revenue source over the next five years, while reducing
   the reserve as quickly as possible, the 2-year renewal fee was
   increased in April, 2000, to $35, which is still lower than the fee in
   effect prior to 1995. If the fee had been maintained at the $20 level,
   COMDA would have been in a deficit position in FY 2000-01 due to budget
   augmentations to computerize the RDA written examination, revise the
   Dental Auxiliary Handbook of Laws and Regulations, and issue biannual
   newsletters informing auxiliaries of law, regulation, and procedural
   requirements and changes. In order to assure that applicants pay the
   costs of their applicable examinations, the fee for the RDA written
   examination was raised from $35 to $50 in November, 1999. For the same
   reason, the fee for the RDA practical examination was increased from
   $45 to $55 in August, 2000. All other fees have remained the same since
   at least 1992. The Table below shows COMDA's past and projected
   revenues, expenditures, and fund condition. The increase in revenue
   shown in Fiscal Year 2000-2001 is due to the collection by COMDA of RDA
   written examination fees, which were previously collected by the test
   administrator, the Dental Assisting National Board. Past and Projected

   COMPONENT The Table presented below shows COMDA=s expenditures by the
   following components: Licensing, Enforcement, Examination, Licensing,
   and Administrative, and Diversion. The vast majority of COMDA's
   expenditures are directed toward examination and licensing, the only
   duties it has been statutorily mandated to perform. All consumer
   education, complaint handling, and enforcement are handled by the
   Dental Board. The calculations for Administrative expenditures were
   changed in FY99/00 to more accurately apply Statewide and Departmental
   pro-rata across all components, rather than attributing them primarily
   to Administrative expenditures as had been done in the past.

   FY96/97 statistics are not available. LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS EDUCATION,
   EXPERIENCE AND EXAMINATION REQUIREMENTS REGISTERED DENTAL ASSISTANTS
   (RDA) License Requirements Applicants for RDA licensure must have (1)
   graduated from a Board-approved RDA educational program of a minimum of
   720 hours (approximately 8 months); or, (2) completed at least 18
   months of satisfactory paid work experience as a dental assistant with
   a licensed dentist(s) in the United States; or (3) completed a
   Department of Education approved 4-month educational program, and 14
   months of work experience. In 1998, the Department of Consumer Affairs
   sponsored successful legislation for COMDA and the Board, whereby
   applicants are now allowed to use experience gained outside of
   California to meet the work experience requirement. COMDA and the Board
   wish to pursue legislation to reduce the experience requirement from 18
   months to 12 months. Once determined qualified, applicants must
   successfully complete both a written and practical examination.
   Licensure Examinations The following Table shows the historical pass
   rates on both examinations. RDA Practical and Written Examination Pass
   Rates FY96/97 FY97/98 FY98/99 FY99/00 Practical Exams Administered
   4,656 4,191 3,587 3,915 - Pass % 49% 65% 68% 65% Written Exams
   Administered 3,307 3,109 3,271 3,726 - Pass % 73% 80% 76% 72% The
   content of the RDA practical examination is defined by regulation,
   which specifies that one or more of ten possible job-related procedures
   be tested during any given exam session. The examination is conducted
   on a typodont (a plastic model of jaws with teeth), and is graded by
   two independent examiners, each of whom have a minimum of five (5)
   years of experience practicing as an RDA and extensive training on the
   examination criteria. Based on an occupational analysis conducted in
   1993, the examination was evaluated for relevance and validity, and
   substantially changed by eliminating several testable duties that
   unlicensed persons could perform. Through input provided at many
   informational hearings and Task Force studies recently completed, COMDA
   sought and received Board approval to limit the examination to two
   procedures found to be the most frequently performed, job-related
   duties, in 2001. In addition, it is anticipated that the examination
   will be administered on a monthly basis (rather than 3 exam cycles
   annually) beginning in January, 2001. The RDA written examination is
   currently administered for COMDA by the Dental Assisting National Board
   (DANB), a non-profit organization, in concert with COMDA's RDA Written
   Test Construction Subcommittee. The examination is a test of knowledge
   of RDA job functions, duties, and settings as defined in the California
   Dental Practice Act. The examination covers nutrition and preventive
   dentistry; dental materials; oral anatomy and physiology, oral
   pathology; pharmacology; morphology; microbiology, dental assisting
   procedures in general and specialty dentistry; legal and ethical
   aspects of dentistry; four-handed chairside dental assisting, x-ray,
   and sterilization; and laboratory and office emergency procedures. The
   content of the written examination was revised based on the
   occupational analysis conducted in 1993, to assure job-relatedness and
   focus on RDA duties and safety issues rather than unregulated dental
   assistant duties. Beginning with the 2001 examinations, COMDA will
   migrate to a computerized system administered under the Department of
   Consumer Affairs' Master Service Agreement with Experior. DANB will
   continue to provide psychometric services in terms of examination
   construction and item bank analysis. As a result, applicants will be
   able to take the examination on a date and location most convenient to
   them. Another occupational analysis of RDA practitioners is scheduled
   for FY00/01. The following table shows average times from application
   to license issuance. This indicated time includes a 60-day period by
   which applications must be filed prior to examination, as specified in
   regulation, which is the period during which applications are
   evaluated, criminal histories evaluated, and examinations scheduled.

   to determine their satisfaction with certain processes, and to obtain
   their recommendations for increasing service levels. Results show high
   levels of satisfaction with the ease of application instructions and
   forms (91%), the length of the open filing period (87%), efficiency of
   the exam process (95%), instructions during the exam process (94%), and
   the attitudes of exam personnel (96%). Allowable Duties COMDA
   successfully sought a regulatory change by the Board in 1999 and 2000
   to allow RDA's to bleach teeth and fabricate temporary crowns
   intra-orally. REGISTERED DENTAL HYGIENIST (RDH) License Requirements
   RDH licensure applicants must have graduated from a Dental Hygiene
   educational program accredited by the Joint Commission on Dental
   Accreditation (a minimum of a 2-year college program) and completed
   expanded functions courses if such expanded functions were not included
   in the program=s course of instruction. Applicants must also have
   passed the National written examination. Qualified applicants must then
   successfully complete a COMDA-administered clinical examination.

   rate on the examination. RDH Clinical Examination Pass Rates FY96/97

   Pass % 80% 77% 76% 75% The content of the RDH clinical examination is
   specifically defined by regulation, and takes about three (3) hours to
   complete. Each examination is graded by two independent examiners, each
   of whom have at least five (5) years of licensed work experience as an
   RDH and extensive training in the examination criteria. The examination
   consists of the performance of an oral prophylaxis on a human patient,
   which includes: (1) an examination of the patient, who must meet
   specific criteria; (2) periodontal probing of one or two quadrants; (3)
   complete scaling and root planing of one or two quadrants, which
   includes the complete removal of calculus, soft deposits and plaque,
   and smoothing of the unattached tooth surfaces, under local anesthesia.
   COMDA conducted an occupational analysis of this profession in 1998,
   and is currently utilizing the results to evaluate the clinical
   examination. While the examination has not previously been validated,
   it is well recognized that the above tested procedures are the duties
   that are by far the most integral to the practice of dental hygiene.
   The following table shows average times from application to license
   issuance. This indicated time includes a 30-day period by which
   applications must be filed prior to examination, as specified in
   regulation, which is the period during which applications are
   evaluated, criminal histories evaluated, and examinations scheduled.

   RDH's to irrigate subgingivally with antimicrobial and/or antibiotic
   liquid solutions. EXTENDED FUNCTIONS (RDAEF and RDHEF) License
   Requirements A licensed RDA with coronal polishing certification, or an
   RDH with expanded function certifications, may apply for licensure as
   an RDAEF or RDHEF after completing a specific Board-approved course
   affiliated with a dental school, which must be a minimum of 90 hours in
   length. Qualified applicants must then successfully complete a
   COMDA-administered clinical examination. Licensure Examination The
   following Table shows the historical pass rate on the examination. EF

   Clinical Exams Administered 59 108 96 85 - Pass % 86% 84% 77% 76% The
   examination is graded independently by two dentists or EF's, each of
   whom have been licensed to practice for at least five years. The
   content of the EF examination is specifically defined by regulation,
   and includes the performance of the following procedures on a human
   patient during one 30- minute and one 45-minute session: (1) cord
   retraction of gingivae for an impression procedure, and (2) taking of
   an impression for a cast restoration. Prior to 1996, EF candidates also
   had to take and pass a third procedure, which involved the fitting of
   trial endodontic filling points. Based on a survey of all practitioners
   in 1994, it was found that more than 60% had never performed this
   procedure in real practice. Therefore, COMDA successfully sought a
   regulatory change by the Board to eliminate this examination
   requirement. The two procedures tested above, of seven specific duties
   that EF=s are allowed to perform, are the most commonly performed
   procedures, with more than 50% of 1994 survey practitioners performing
   them 6 or more times per week. COMDA conducted an occupational analysis
   of this profession in 1998, and is currently utilizing the results to
   evaluate the clinical examination. The following table shows average
   times from application to license issuance. This indicated time
   includes a 30-day period by which applications must be filed prior to
   examination, as specified in regulation, which is the period during
   which applications are evaluated, criminal histories evaluated, and
   examinations scheduled. EF  Average FY 1996/97 FY97/98 FY98/99 FY99/00

   routinely surveys examinees to determine their satisfaction with
   certain processes, and to obtain their recommendations for increasing
   service levels. Results show high levels of satisfaction with the ease
   of application instructions and forms (100%), the length of the open
   filing period (93%), efficiency of the exam process (94%), instructions
   during the exam process (100%), and the attitudes of exam personnel
   (100%). Allowable Duties COMDA successfully sought a regulatory change
   by the Board in 1999 and 2000 which allows EF to perform two new
   duties: remove excess cement from subgingival tooth surfaces with a
   hand instrument, and apply etchant for bonding restorative materials.
   REGISTERED DENTAL HYGIENIST IN ALTERNATIVE PRACTICE (RDHAP) Effective
   January 1, 1998, a new category of licensure was established by AB560
   (Perata): Registered Dental Hygienist in Alternative Practice (RDHAP).
   Once licensed, an RDHAP may practice as an employee of a dentist or of
   another registered dental hygienist in alternative practice, as an
   independent contractor, or as a sole proprietor of an alternative
   dental hygiene practice. They may perform the duties established by
   Dental Board regulation in the following settings: (1) Residences of
   the homebound. (2) Schools. (3) Residential facilities and other
   institutions. (4) Dental health professional shortage areas, as
   certified by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development.
   An RDHAP may only perform allowable services for a patient who presents
   a written prescription for dental hygiene services issued by a dentist
   or physician and surgeon licensed to practice in this state who has
   performed a physical examination and a diagnosis of the patient prior
   to a prescription being provided. The prescription shall be valid for a
   time period based on the dentist's or physician and surgeon's
   professional judgment, but not to exceed 15 months from the date that
   it was issued. Applicants for RDHAP licensure are required to hold a
   current RDH license, have been engaged in clinical practice as a dental
   hygienist for a minimum of 2,000 hours during the immediately preceding
   36 months, possess a bachelor's degree or its equivalent, complete 150
   hours of approved coursework, and pass a written examination prescribed
   by the Dental Board. COMDA appointed a Subcommittee in early FY99/00 to
   develop a written examination outline, which was approved by COMDA and
   the Board in early 2000. An examination will be constructed by the end
   of calendar year 2000. However, no programs have yet been submitted to
   the Dental Board seeking approval to offer the coursework, so the only
   persons licensed to practice thus far are those who completed the
   employment phase of a prior Health Manpower Pilot Project and
   established an independent practice by June 30, 1997, whom the law
   "grandfathered". Individuals meeting these requirements must complete
   an application, and pay a $20 application fee and a $56 fingerprint
   fee. A license is issued immediately once the applicant's criminal
   history background investigation has been completed. In FY98/99, COMDA
   issued 18 RDHAP licenses to those who met the above requirements, and 3
   in FY99/00. CONTINUING EDUCATION/COMPETENCY REQUIREMENTS Under current
   law, there is no requirement for re-certification. However, if a
   license has not been renewed after a period of five years, the license
   is cancelled and the person may be required to again pass the licensure
   examination to ensure that knowledge is current and skills proficient.
   Continued competency is currently addressed through the continuing
   education requirement. RDA's, RDH's, and EF's are required to complete
   25 hours of continuing education, and RDHAP's 35 hours, including a
   course in basic life support, every two years. Regulations define those
   courses considered to be outside the scope of dental continuing
   education which include those that are unrelated to dentistry and
   dental practice, or related very indirectly. During the 1998-99 renewal
   period, dentists and auxiliaries were required to take 3 hours in
   California law and 4 hours in Infection Control. In 41 other states,
   auxiliaries are required to complete continuing education units ranging
   from 12 to 30 hours every two years. COMITY/RECIPROCITY WITH OTHER
   STATES A person licensed as a dental auxiliary by another jurisdiction,
   whether another state or country, must qualify in the same manner as
   any other applicant, since licensed California auxiliaries are allowed
   to perform many duties that auxiliaries are not allowed to perform
   elsewhere. The skill level of candidates cannot be determined without a
   demonstration that they are minimally qualified to perform the duties
   which California law and regulations will allow them to perform once
   licensed. Neither in- state nor out-of-state applicants are allowed to
   practice prior to licensure. As stated earlier, legislation sought by
   COMDA was enacted effective January 1, 2000, to allow RDA applicants to
   use experience gained outside of California in qualifying for the
   licensure examinations. ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY COMDA is not authorized by
   statute, nor administratively by the Dental Board of California, to
   perform any enforcement activity related to auxiliary applicants or
   licensees. Instead, COMDA reimburses the Dental Board for its
   investigative and diversion services, and pays the Office of the
   Attorney General for services directed by the Dental Board for
   auxiliary enforcement cases. CONSUMER OUTREACH AND EDUCATION The
   Committee has not been delegated any responsibilities by the Board in
   the area of consumer education. However, COMDA has maintained an
   extensive website for over two years which can assist consumers in
   terms of the duties which auxiliaries are legally allowed to perform.
   INTERNET SERVICES As noted above, COMDA has maintained a user-friendly
   website since March, 1998. Perhaps as a result, the number of phone
   calls received has decreased from about 25,000 annually in FY1996-97 to
   about 16,700 in FY 1999-2000 (a decline of about 33%), while the
   licensing populations and other workload parameters either rose or
   remained stable. The website provides the public with all of the laws
   and regulations governing dental auxiliary practice, including
   allowable duties and prohibited practices, and provides information on
   how to file complaints against practitioners with The Dental Board, or
   against COMDA itself. The site also provides the following information:
   1. Notices of COMDA and Subcommittee meetings, text of agenda items,
   and minutes. 2. Downloadable forms and instructions for all licensing
   categories. 3. Downloadable information about each examination. 4. The
   ability to change licensee addresses online. 5. A "FAQ" (Frequently
   Asked Questions) section providing answers to the most frequently
   received questions by COMDA. 6. Links to the Department of Consumer
   Affairs' "Look-Up" web pages whereby the status of all dental auxiliary
   licenses and disciplinary history can be viewed. 7. Special notices
   about recent policy, regulations, and law changes. COMDA's online
   presence has recently been enhanced by implementation of the Department
   of Justice's Live Scan program, whereby applicants can have their
   fingerprints rolled at a local site, which are then electronically
   transmitted to DOJ, and the criminal history results later transmitted
   to COMDA. This allows applicants who must obtain an official
   Application form just shortly before a filing deadline to download all
   necessary forms from the internet, whereas in the past they were
   required to request and receive fingerprint "hard cards" from COMDA
   which had to accompany their Application. The most difficult challenge
   COMDA has encountered in its efforts to provide accurate and timely
   information to the public is the current inability to link directly to
   pertinent regulations in the California Code of Regulations. Instead,
   COMDA must maintain and carefully update its own duplicative database
   of regulations, unlike its ability to easily link to all of the
   statutes maintained by the Legislative Counsel. Depending on future
   resources and the abilities to integrate all computer systems
   maintained by the Department, assure data security, and accept digital
   signatures for documents that must be signed, COMDA believes the
   following online capabilities may assist the public in terms of
   increased convenience and timeliness, and reduction of postage costs
   and paper use: 1. Filing of applications if accompanied by credit card
   payment of fees and digital signature. 2. Applicant access to
   examination results. 3. Direct address change access by licensees. 4.
   Renewal of licenses if accompanied by credit card payment of fees and
   digital signature. Part 2. Committee on Dental Auxiliaries Of the
   Dental Board of California COMDA's Response to Issues Identified and
   Former Recommendations Made by the Joint Legislative Sunset Review
   Committee PRIOR ISSUES Senate Bill 2036 (Chapter 908, Statutes of 1994)
   requires periodic legislative review of all boards within the
   Department of Consumer Affairs. The first COMDA Sunset Review Report
   was a comprehensive report on all aspects of COMDA's activities
   submitted to the Joint Legislative Sunset Review Committee (JLSRC). As
   a result, the JLSRC authored legislation, SB826, extending COMDA's
   sunset date to July 1, 2002. One of the JLSRC's Findings and
   Recommendations, issued in April, 1997, was that COMDA should continue
   to be the state agency delegated responsibility for the regulation of
   dental auxiliaries, subject to organizational changes with the Board of
   Dental Examiners {deletion of their separate statutory Auxiliary
   Committee}. It concluded that COMDA's current role and responsibilities
   should be codified, and that COMDA should manage its duties as a direct
   statutory committee of the Dental Board. The JLSRC decided not to take
   a position on whether or not to create an independent licensing board
   for dental auxiliaries at that time. This recommendation was addressed
   by SB826, as was the extension of COMDA's sunset date, by placing into
   statute the duties which COMDA had been historically delegated by the
   Dental Board, and making COMDA a direct statutory committee of the
   Board, effective January 1, 1998. In addition, SB713 (Rosenthal), also
   effective January 1, 1998, amended and added laws providing that COMDA
   shall evaluate all suggestions for regulatory changes, may hold
   informational hearings, and may request the reasons in writing if the
   Board rejects or significantly modifies any of its recommendations. The
   second and final finding of the JLSRC was that the composition of COMDA
   should be reviewed, seeking input from all interested parties to strike
   a proper balance of representation. Following the JLSRC's findings and
   recommendations, SB713 (Rosenthal), sponsored by the California Dental
   Hygienists' Association and effective January 1, 1998, changed the
   composition of COMDA by requiring that the member of COMDA who must
   also be a member of the Board, must be a public member of the Board,
   and that an RDHEF and RDAEF will be appointed, if available. Following
   is a summary of COMDA's view of the impact of the above legislation: 1.
   Codification of COMDA Duties and Responsibilities COMDA has continued
   to perform the same responsibilities as it had before codification of
   its duties and responsibilities, but perhaps has done so with a larger
   measure of confidence knowing that the Board is unable to
   administratively remove those duties from COMDA's administration at
   will. 2. Direct Reporting to the Board Elimination of the Board's
   separate Auxiliary Committee, thereby allowing COMDA to report directly
   to the Board or its Examination or Enforcement Committees instead of
   the Board's Auxiliary Committee, has been more efficient
   administratively and allows more Board members to learn of the reasons
   and justifications for COMDA's recommendations directly. 3. Evaluation
   of Regulatory Change Requests and Holding of Informational Hearings All
   requests for regulatory changes have been referred to COMDA for its
   input, and COMDA has held a number of Informational Hearings relating
   to those proposals and other issues. 4. Rejection or Significant
   Modification of COMDA Recommendations Since the last Sunset Review,
   COMDA has made a large number of recommendations to the Board, many of
   which were accepted by the Board. Several were rejected or
   significantly modified: ÿ Proposed Additional RDH Duties The Board
   rejected COMDA's recommendation in May, 1999, that RDH's be allowed to
   place antimicrobial and antibiotic medicaments that do not later have
   to be removed, under general supervision. A Board motion also failed
   that would have allowed RDH's to perform this duty under direct dentist
   supervision. COMDA's recommendation followed an extensive occupational
   analysis of RDH practice, meetings and hearings held by a special COMDA
   Subcommittee, COMDA meetings, and a joint COMDA/Board hearing. COMDA
   requested on May 14, 1999, that the reasons for the Board's rejection
   of the recommendation be placed in writing, which was issued July 16,
   1999. The Board's summary reasons were that "1. the newness of the
   products being considered for application and potential harm to the
   public. 2. Only allowing dentists to place these medicaments and to
   complete the necessary follow-up on the safety and efficacy of these
   products better serves the public at this time." "The Board feels that
   the issue should be reevaluated in one year, subsequent to dentists
   having a greater opportunity to evaluate the negative consequences of
   the use of these medicaments in order to ensure maximum safety to the
   public." Since that time, the Board adopted a regulatory change
   allowing RDH's to irrigate subgingivally with antimicrobial and/or
   antibiotic liquid solutions, but not the placement of
   antibacterial-impregnated cord, dissolving chips, gels or other
   non-liquid medicaments. ÿ Proposed Additional EF Duties The Board
   rejected COMDA's recommendation in August, 1999, that EF's be allowed
   to place, condense, carve, and polish amalgams, and place composites,
   under direct dentist supervision. COMDA's recommendation followed an
   extensive occupational analysis of EF practice, meetings and hearings
   held by a special COMDA Subcommittee, COMDA meetings, and a joint
   COMDA/Board hearing. COMDA requested on August 20, 1999, that the
   reasons for the Board's rejection of the recommendation be place in
   writing, which was issued December 2, 1999, and amended December 9,
   1999, and February 15, 2000. The Board's summary reasons were that
   "members expressed concern that allowing extended functions auxiliaries
   to place, carve, condense and polish amalgams and to place direct
   composites, is not in the public's best interest." ÿ Implementation of
   AB560  New RDHAP Licensure Classification AB560 (Perata), sponsored by
   the California Dental Hygienist's Association, established a new
   category of auxiliary licensure: Registered Dental Hygienist in
   Alternative Practice effective January 1, 1998. The law required that
   by January 1, 1999, the Dental Board, upon recommendations of COMDA
   that must have been made no later than February 15, 1998, shall adopt
   regulations prescribing the content for the 150 hours of required
   coursework, and the duties that RDHAP's would be permitted to perform.
   The new laws further provided that if the board did not adopt such
   regulations, the coursework and duties for alternative dental hygiene
   practice that were established under the auspices of the Health
   Manpower Pilot Project would govern RDHAP practice until 30 days
   following the date on which the board adopts such regulations. During
   1998, COMDA issued 17 RDHAP licenses to "grandfather" those RDHAP's who
   had entered the employment phase of the past HMMP, as directed by the
   provisions of the new laws. In January, 1998, COMDA recommended a
   number of new regulations to implement all provisions of the new laws,
   which included duties which could be performed by a general
   prescription, and those that could be performed by a specific
   prescription. The recommendations were reviewed by the Board's
   Legislative Committee and a Board Ad Hoc Committee in March, 1998. They
   recommended that the Board revise COMDA's recommendation that certain
   duties be performed by a general prescription and some by specific
   prescription, and instead recommended that RDHAP's be allowed to
   perform fewer duties than proposed by COMDA. The recommendations also
   included a requirement that any duties to be performed must be
   specified in the prescription, as well as several technical amendments.
   The Board considered its two Committee's recommendations, which were
   largely accepted, and the regulations were referred for regulatory
   hearing. At the Board's regulatory hearing in August, 1998, it decided
   to change the regulations to allow RDHAP's to perform all duties that
   RDH's are allowed to perform under general supervision, rather than
   restricting the duties. The rulemaking file was disapproved by AOL in
   August, 1999, for technical clarity and consistency reasons. In May
   2000, the Board revised the regulations to eliminate the requirement
   that the referring prescription must describe the specific duties that
   the RDHAP can perform, and all regulations governing RDHAP's are now in
   effect. No RDHAP educational programs have been submitted to the Board
   for approval to date; therefore, no new licenses are expected to be
   issued in the near future, since applicants must complete both an
   approved RDHAP educational program and pass a written examination. 5.
   Composition The statutory change in COMDA's composition (requiring that
   the designated member who is a member of the Dental Board be a public
   member of the Dental Board, and that the EF members will be appointed
   only if available) has had no impact, since the positions were filled
   prior to enactment of the statutory change and the terms have not
   expired. NEW ISSUES 1. Registered Dental Assistant (RDA) Work
   Experience Requirement Currently, applicants for Registered Dental
   Assistant (RDA) licensure must either complete a Dental Board-approved
   educational program of approximately 8 months duration, or 18 months of
   qualifying work experience with a dentist licensed in one of the states
   of the United States. COMDA and the Dental Board believe that RDA's
   should only be required to acquire 12 months of work experience rather
   than 18 months, to provide a more equitable time commitment between the
   two tracks of qualification. At the same time, COMDA and the Board
   believe that new applicants should be required to complete approved
   courses in radiation safety and coronal polishing prior to licensing,
   and that existing RDA licensees be required to take such courses within
   a specific period of time. Currently, an RDA must take such courses
   after licensure if they wish to perform these duties, which means that
   there are really four different RDA categories, those who, in addition
   to other specified duties: (1) may not perform either of these critical
   duties; (2) may expose radiographs, but not perform coronal polishing;
   (3) those who may not expose radiographs, but may perform coronal
   polishing; and (4) those who may both expose radiographs and perform
   coronal polishing. As a result, there is considerable confusion in the
   dental community as to allowable duties, which reportedly results in
   significant unlawful activity. Requiring RDA's to take both courses as
   a part of licensure would improve consumer protection with regard to
   the performance of potentially hazardous duties by untrained,
   unlicensed auxiliaries. This would require an amendment to Section 1753
   of the Business and Professions Code. 2. Examiner Pay Levels Currently,
   Business and Professions Code Sections 1621.1 and 1621.4 specify that
   examiners who perform as examiners for the dental licensure examination
   and the Registered Dental Hygiene (RDH) examination may be paid a
   maximum of $100 per day, the same as Dental Board and COMDA members.
   This prohibition has been in effect for over 29 years. COMDA also
   employs examiners who grade the Extended Function (EF) and Registered
   Dental Assistant (RDA) examinations, who are not subject to this
   prohibition, nor does it seem to apply to any other Boards. The current
   restriction has begun to unduly effect COMDA's ability to recruit and
   retain qualified RDH examiners, who must work 10-12 hour exam weekends,
   in addition to their normal work week. Preliminary analysis has shown
   that a more appropriate pay level would only result in an additional
   expenditure of about $70,000 annually. Since examiners are in fact
   contractors with various degrees of expertise, it would be more
   appropriate for RDH examiners to be removed from these sections of law,
   which would allow COMDA and the Board to determine through the
   regulatory or administration process what the appropriate rate of pay
   should be to attract and retain qualified personnel. This would require
   an amendment to Sections 1621.1 and 1621.4 of the Business and
   Professions Code. 3. Required Meetings in Sacramento and Los Angeles
   Business and Professions Code Section 1749 requires, in part, that
   COMDA hold at least one meeting per year in Sacramento and one in Los
   Angeles. Typically COMDA meets 4 to 5 times per year. It is not known
   why the requirement was placed into statute. It places an unwieldly
   restriction on COMDA's attempt to coordinate its meetings with the
   Dental Board of California, in efforts to increase communication
   between the two bodies, and does not allow scheduling of meetings where
   the most public interest and attendance is expected. 4. Creation of a
   Separate Board to Regulate Dental Auxiliaries SB1215 (Perata) was
   introduced in 2000, which is now inactive, that would have created a
   Board, separate from that of the Dental Board of California, to
   regulate dental auxiliaries. COMDA has not taken a position on such
   legislation in the past, and does not intend to do so if similar
   legislation is introduced in the future, for two primary reasons: a.
   COMDA's support of or opposition to the concept of a separate board, or
   even additional regulatory duties, would not contribute to a meaningful
   discussion of the issue(s), since any position could be viewed as
   self-serving. b. COMDA is a committee within the statutory jurisdiction
   of the Dental Board of California. As such, it has historically not
   taken public positions that may be contradictory to those of its
   statutory Board. In view of the above, COMDA will certainly provide any
   factual data that may be requested, but recommends that the Legislature
   rely on whatever other sources it believes appropriate to determine the
   feasibility and desirability of creating such a board.
