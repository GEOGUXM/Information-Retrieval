                                I. Background

   Transit agencies have increasingly developed internet sites to provide
     information on their services to the public. To a great degree, the
     private sector has left the provision of transit information to the
    agencies. Transit web sites developed by the public sector often have
     more desirable features than private sites, but do not have all the
    features that users would like. A review of metropolitan transit web
    sites revealed that certain features, such as itinerary planning and
         current news, service updates, or real-time information are
     particularly rare. This database has been developed to help transit
   agencies identify comparable agencies with good internet sites in order
   to improve their own. The database is expected to help transit agencies
   benchmark their web sites against comparable agencies, as well as give
   them examples of how other agencies have developed particular features.
     It includes information on the features available at each web site,
     characteristics of the agencies, and information about the service
   areas of the agencies. In addition, usability ratings were included to
   allow the presentation of the search results sorted by general quality.

                        II. Hints For Using The Site:

     Looking to develop a feature? Search on that feature on the Search
   for Sites by Web Site Features tab and look at the best sites at the
   top of the results list.

     Looking to benchmark your web site against similar agencies' web
   sites? Check the summary information below for agencies similar to
   yours, then search for more specific examples on the Search for Similar
   Agencies or Search for Similar Service Areas tabs. Remember to look at
   the top of the list for the best sites.

     To find a site based on location of the transit agency, try the APTA
   Web Site.

     Have suggestions or questions? Think we missed something? Contact Us
   and let us know.

     All web sites were reviewed during July and August 2001, so changes
   and improvements to the sites are likely the farther from that time.

                                 Top of Page


                      III. Web Site Feature Definitions

       There are eight general feature areas for which the sites were
                                  reviewed:
     * Route choosing content
     * Route specific information
     * Multimodal information
     * Tourist information
     * Links
     * Current news, service updates or real-time information
     * Rules and restrictions
     * Contact information

     With the exception of tourist information, all of these areas were
    mentioned by the users of metropolitan transit web sites as including
      desirable features in customer preference or usabilitiy studies.
   Tourist information is included in the review because it is information
    that could be very useful to people not from the area. In addition to
    the content areas reviewed, usability of the web site was also rated
   for inclusion in the quality ranking used to sort results of searches.

     Route choosing content includes system maps and itinerary planners.
      This information is valuable to users who are unfamiliar with the
      system or who are considering taking a different trip than usual.

     Route specific information includes route maps, schedules and fare
    information, including fare purchase locations and online purchase of
    fare media. This information is essential to all users of the transit
   system so they know the details of where and when to board and how much
                                  it costs.

   Multimodal information includes information on traffic conditions, park
   and ride lots, and the use of bicycles in conjunction with the transit
      system. Including traffic condition information on the site aids
        potential users in deciding whether to take transit or drive.
   Information on park and ride lots and the use of bicycles with transit
    can extend the reach of the system by letting potential users who are
   beyond walking distance explore the option of combining modes for their
                                    trip.

    Tourist information highlights common tourist destinations on maps or
       provides other information that would be relevant to tourists.

     Links includes hyperlinks to other web sites with relevant content,
     such as other local transit sites, traffic sites, public intercity
        transportation (bus, train, air), and local, state or federal
     government sites involved in transit. These links allow individuals
     easy access to information that may help them plan their full trip
                beyond the boundaries of the transit system.

   Current news, service updates, or real-time information provide transit
    users with alerts on changes that may affect their use of the system.

   Rules and restrictions include much of the other information needed to
                           use the transit system.

        Contact information can be provided for telephone or e-mail.

                              IV. Demographics

     A total of 637 web sites were successfully reviewed. The sites were
   both official and unofficial sites for agencies and were categorized in
   two ways: by Federal funding source and by whether they serve an urban
    or rural area. The funding sources represented include urbanized area
   agencies, specialized transportation agencies and rural transportation
     agencies. Urban areas are categorized primarily by the size of the
      metropolitan statistical area, while rural areas were assigned to
                              market segments.

     A total of 287 agencies in the sample receive Urbanized Area (NTD)
    funds, nine receive Specialized Transportation (5310) funds, and 141
     receive Rural Public Transportation (5311) funds. It is likely that
   there are other transit web sites that were not included in the review,
   so these figures should be taken as indicative of the relative numbers
          of sites by funding source, but not as absolute numbers.

     There were noticeably more urban transit web sites than rural: 520
    compared to 117. Within the category of urban agencies, 164 web sites
   were for agencies in areas with a population of over 2.5 million. Some
   very small areas are also represented, with 30 web sites for areas with
     fewer than 140,000 people. The rural areas were divided among eight
   market segments (number of sites in parentheses): commuter-based (71),
    self-contained high growth (4), self-contained low growth (5), sparse
        (4), tourist destinations (20), unclassified high growth (5),
      unclassified low growth (4). As noted, commuter-based and tourist
      destination areas are represented most often in the sample of web
                                   sites.

                            V. Major Conclusions

    Based on the review of transit web sites, certain observations can be
                      made about their characteristics:
     * There is wide variation across web sites in content and
       presentation of information. This variation is present within
       groups of web sites from similar rural or urban areas or eligible
       for the same category of federal funds.
     * The most common features are fare and schedule information, but
       they are not universally present. Since this information is
       essential to using a transit system, it seems that significant
       improvements could be made by adding the information to the sites
       that lack it. There was no significant change between last year and
       this year in the percentage of agencies with the information.
     * The main area of improvement in the past year is for route choosing
       content. System maps have been improved so that more show transfer
       points clearly. Itinerary planners are still rare but becoming more
       common.
     * A fair number of transit web sites have links to other sites,
       although they are not necessarily the complete set of sites that
       users may find helpful, or a comprehensive set of web sites
       providing information on all modes of transportation available in
       the area. The links frequently include sites that are irrelevant
       and sometimes imply transportation options that are not available.
     * The most common type of information on other modes of
       transportation is information about the use of bicycles in
       conjunction with transit. Information that might facilitate a
       decision about whether to drive or take transit, such as traffic
       conditions, links to traffic sites, or information on park and ride
       lots is rare.

     These observations highlight the need for research and outreach in
                               several areas:
     * Appropriate web site content: define the purposes of the site,
       include information that is necessary for the purposes, and exclude
       information that is not necessary
     * User interfaces: improve sites to make them easier to use and more
       accessible. Go to the Useful links page for links to resources for
       improving user interfaces.
     * Linkages among transportation web sites: define where transit sites
       should link to and where they should link from. Providing or
       linking to information on other modes of transportation available
       in the area could help riders and potential riders make informed
       decisions about whether and where to take transit.

                 VI. Frequency Of Features On All Web Sites

   The most common features are fare and schedule information. Since this
    information is basic to the use of transit, it would seem that every
   transit web site should have it. Only 88% of sites had fare information
   and 81% had comprehensive schedule information. It is likely that some
       of the sites without comprehensive schedule information are for
    strictly demand responsive services, but that is not true across the
    board. While close to half of all sites had maps for specific routes,
     system maps were less common, with 44% of sites having any type of
                                 system map.

      A high proportion of transit web sites have links to other sites,
   although they are not necessarily the complete set of sites that users
   may find helpful. Links to other transit sites were present 41% of the
     time, while traffic information links were only available 7% of the
                                    time.

VII. Frequency Of Features On Web Sites By Federal Funding Source For Agency

     Most features are more common for agencies receiving urbanized area
    funds, compared to rural or specialized transportation, but agencies
   receiving rural public transportation funds are somewhat more likely to
    have links to other relevant web sites. The greatest differences are
      for system maps, and current and real-time information. There is
    relatively little difference across types of agencies for most other
     features. Agencies receiving Rural Public Transportation funds have
     increased use of advanced features such as online purchase of fare
                           media since last year.


                       Table 2. Route Choosing Content

   System maps are most common for agencies receiving Urbanized Area (NTD)
   funds. They also tend to be more sophisticated than the system maps for
   Rural Transportation agencies. It is likely that the complexity of the
            maps reflect the size and complexity of the systems.

                      Table 3. Route-Specific Information

    Urbanized area agencies are most likely to have most types of
    route-specific information, although rural public transportation
    agencies are slightly more likely to have fare information and nearly
    as likely to have schedules.

                             Table 4. Multimodal

    Park and ride information is most likely to be provided on urbanized
    areas or specialized transportation web sites. Information on bicycle
     use with transit appears on more than a third of urbanized area web
                sites and on about a quarter of rural sites.

     Specialized transportation agencies are most likely to have tourist
     information on their websites, followed by urbanized areas and then
                                rural areas.

      Fewer than 50 percent of all agencies have links to other transit
     websites, a quarter have intercity transportation links and about a
      third have links to government agencies. Few sites have links to
     traffic information. Urbanized area and rural public transportation
        agencies are similar with respect to the links they provide.

   VIII. Frequency Of Features On Urban Web Sites

      Certain features are more common the larger the urban area. These
      features include system maps, on-line purchase of fare media, current
      news, service updates, or real-time information, and information on
      park and ride lots.

      Only slightly more than half of the urban web sites reviewed had route
      maps and slightly fewer had system maps. Although text must be provided
      to ensure accessibility to the information, maps are one of the easiest
      ways for transit riders to determine which route to use and where it
      goes. Adding maps to the remaining urban web sites is an opportunity to
      make the transit systems more user friendly.


   Table 9. Route Choosing Content

   In general, transit agencies in larger urbanized areas have system maps
   that are more fully featured. Itinerary planners are most prevalent in
   areas with populations greater than one million.

   Table 11. Multimodal Information

   Park and ride information is available on roughly a quarter of all
   cities with populations over 600,000. The number of transit agencies
   featuring bike information remained constant throughout the different
   cities. Traffic or construction information was scarce, appearing only
   on one multimodal site.

   Links to other transit sites and links to government sites were the
   most common. Intercity public transportation was the next most common
   type of link. The largest cities had sites that were most likely to
   link to other transit sites, while the smallest city transit sites were
   most likely to link to government sites.

                IX. Frequency Of Features On Rural Web Sites

   Rural transit web sites tend to have fewer features than urban transit
   web sites, although some rural market segments are more likely to have
   certain features. Web sites for tourism areas tend to have more
   features than typical web sites for rural areas, and self-contained low
   growth areas tend to have web sites with fewer features. A higher
   percentage of tourist destination web sites have transit promotion and
   cross-promotion information than any category of urban web sites.

   About a third of rural transit systems have system maps. Tourist
   destinations are most likely to have a system map with clear transfer
   points, as well as some of the more advanced features. Commuter based
   areas and some unclassified rural areas also sometimes have clear
   transfer points marked and the ability to zoom. No rural systems have a
   map that allows the user to locate themselves on it.
