                                             Real-time mesoscale model weather forecasts using the Penn State
   University/National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU/NCAR)
   mesoscale model (MM5) are being produced out to 48 hours twice-daily at
   the Global Hydrology and Climate Center in support of our GOES Data
   Assimilation Project. The current model configuration employs a 36km
   domain that covers the continental United States and a 12km nest over
   the Southeast. Web products from the first 12h of a forecast are
   typically available at 9:00 am (9:00 pm) CST for the 7:00 am (7:00 pm)
   model runs and products valid at 48h typically arrive 2 hours later.

   MM5 is an advanced numerical weather prediction model used for research
   and operational forecasting around the world, maintained by the
   Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology Division of NCAR.

   NOTICE: **** The GHCC MM5 is now initialized with the NCEP RUC2
   analyses ****

   Disclaimer:
   This data not only has the typical disclaimer applied with operational
   model data over the net (i.e., check the date & time of the weather
   products you request on the internet...we cannot guarantee the
   timeliness & availability of some products...this link should not
   replace official dissemination of forecasts & warnings by NOAA WEATHER
   RADIO or other sources), but they also have qualifiers that apply to
   any research of this nature. That is...while we try to ensure this data
   is as accurate and timely as possible, it is a test model. Adjustments
   are made based on past performance to improve model accuracy. Resources
   (both hardware and personnel) are such that things can go wrong in both
   the processing and posting of this data on the net.
