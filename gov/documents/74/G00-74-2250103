   PDF Documents

   Many of the documents available in the USDC, SDNY Web site have been
   formatted as PDF (Portable Document Format) documents. In PDF form,
   each document retains the formatting and appearance of the original
   document and can be viewed on or printed from any computer.

   In order to access a PDF document, you must have Adobe Acrobat Reader
   or Acrobat software. You can download a (free) copy of Acrobat Reader
   if you don't already have it on your computer.

   Viewing PDF Documents

     To view the document, instead of automatically downloading it, your
     browser must be set up to display. (Read the downloading tips
     section of this help page if you want to download instead of viewing
     the document on-line.) If you need specific instructions on how to
     configure your browser to display PDF files, select the applicable
     link below for Adobe technical support.

     Windows:
     * Configuring Netscape Navigator for Windows to Display PDF Files
     * Configuring Internet Explorer for Windows 95, 98 and NT 4.0 to
       Display PDF Files

     Macintosh:
     * Configuring Netscape Navigator for Mac OS to Display PDF Files
     * Configuring Internet Explorer for Mac OS to Display PDF Files

   Saving or Downloading PDF Documents

     If you want to save a PDF document (such as one of the forms) to
     your local computer, you can download by following the instructions
     below. However, if you plan on making changes and saving the changes
     to your computer, you will need the complete Adobe Acrobat software
     (not just the Acrobat Reader), which can be purchased from Adobe or
     an authorized dealer.

   Troubleshooting
     * In order to access a PDF document, you must have Adobe Acrobat
       Reader or Acrobat software. You can download a (free) copy of
       Acrobat Reader if you don't already have it on your computer.
     * If PDF pages are blank inside your Web browser window, read and
       follow the recommended solutions in the Adobe Support
       Knowledgebase. If you then determine that there may be a problem
       with a particular PDF document on this site, please notify the Web
       Administrator (include the CourtWeb Ref # or other file name in
       your e-mail).
     * For other PDF problems, consult the Adobe site for additional
       support.

   Downloading Tips

   PDF Documents

          If you prefer to download a document in PDF format, instead of
          viewing it on-line, hold down the "Shift" key as you click on
          the link to the document. For more detailed instructions on
          downloading a PDF file, follow the Adobe Support downloading
          steps found under the heading "Solution 1."

          You will need to have Adobe Acrobat in order to view the file.
          You can download a (free) copy of Acrobat Reader if you don't
          already have it on your computer. (Read the PDF Documents
          section of this help page for more information on PDF documents
          and additional links for technical support.)


   WordPerfect Documents

          If you have difficulty downloading a WordPerfect document in
          Netscape Navigator, hold down the "Shift" key as you click on
          the document link to force Netscape to download the file.

   Forms

   Completing a Form On-Line

          Some of the Clerk's Office forms (where noted) are set up so
          that you can fill in the blanks on your computer, instead of
          using a typewriter. In order to complete the PDF forms on-line,
          you must have Adobe Acrobat Reader or the full Acrobat software.
          For more information on Adobe Acrobat, read about PDF Documents.
          (Note: CJA forms are in WordPerfect format. See below for more
          information on CJA forms.)

     Hints for On-Line Forms:
     * Make sure that the information entered in each field appears when
       the form is printed.
     * After typing information in a field, either Tab to the next field,
       click outside the field or in the next space with the mouse, or
       press Enter if it's a one-line field.
     * To place an "X" in one of the check boxes, point and click in the
       space with your mouse.
     * The form must be printed out for filing. It cannot be filed
       on-line.
     * If you want to save the form to your computer, in order to retain
       the content of any fields and make any future changes to the
       document, you must have the complete Adobe Acrobat software (not
       just the Reader), which can be purchased from Adobe or an
       authorized dealer.

   To Print a Double-Sided Form, try one of the following methods:

          1.  When sending the document to your printer, instead of
          printing the entire document, either enter the page number or
          select the current page. Print the first page and then manually
          feed the paper to print the second page on the back of the same
          sheet.

          2.  Print both pages separately and then use a photocopier to
          copy the single-sided originals onto one double-sided sheet.

   CJA Forms

     CJA Forms are available in WordPerfect format, with fields set up in
     the document so that the forms can be completed on a computer. Open
     or download the document to your computer, complete it in
     WordPerfect, and print it out for filing. Follow the Hints for
     On-Line Forms, above, with the exception of the check boxes, where
     you must actually type in the "X".

   Browser Types

   This web site will appear and function best with a Netscape or Internet
   Explorer browser, version 3.0 or higher. For best results, use the
   latest browser version of Netscape or Internet Explorer. You can visit
   www.home.NETSCAPE.com/computing/download or www.MICROSOFT.com to
   download the latest version of the Netscape or Microsoft browsers. A
   software download sometimes takes several minutes, so you might want to
   plan accordingly.

   AOL Users

          Your AOL browser may not be compatible, particularly if you have
          an older version, especially when accessing the CourtWeb
          program. Your computer may already have a Netscape or Internet
          Explorer browser loaded on it. If not, you can visit
          www.home.NETSCAPE.com/computing/download or www.MICROSOFT.com
          for information on downloading one of the Netscape or Microsoft
          browsers. When using the Netscape or Internet Explorer browser
          you can log into AOL as usual, then minimize the AOL browser and
          open either Netscape or Internet Explorer for your session. It
          is also recommended that you get the latest version of the AOL
          browser.

   CourtWeb

   Instructions

          The CourtWeb "Welcome" page contains a button that links to
          complete, step-by-step instructions and help. (Watch List
          account holders should access CourtWeb through the Watch List
          log-in page. The log-in screen and main menu each contain a
          button that links to complete instructions and help for Watch
          List users.)
          Note: CourtWeb consists solely of selected rulings of
          participating judges. For docket information or copies of
          pleadings, please contact or visit the Clerk of Court's Records
          Management section. To access docket information on your
          computer, visit the PACER Service Center on-line or call
          1-800-676-6856 for more information.

   Participating Judges

          CourtWeb participating judges are listed on the pull-down menu
          under "Judge," on the Rulings Report page. Click on the arrow in
          the "Judge" field and scroll up or down the list to see the
          judges' names.

   Participating Courts

          You can now search for rulings and enter Watch List cases for
          the Southern District of New York, Northern District of
          Illinois, Western District of Texas, the District of Minnesota
          and the District of Utah. Simply select a district on the
          CourtWeb "Welcome" screen.

          (Watch List account holders will log in as usual and then select
          a jurisdiction from the Watch Entry screen to enter cases from
          participating courts.)

   Full Text of Rulings

          If you have difficulty trying to access the full document text
          of a ruling, read the PDF Documents section of this help page
          for more information on viewing and downloading PDF documents
          and additional links for technical support.

   AOL Users

          Your AOL browser may not be compatible with CourtWeb,
          particularly if you have an older version. Please read the
          information above on browser types.

   Watch List

          Watch List is an additional CourtWeb service that allows the law
          firm or practitioner to enter and edit a private list of cases.
          A Watch List account includes all the features of CourtWeb, plus
          e-mail notification and additional report options for cases on
          your Watch List.

          When a ruling is posted to CourtWeb for a case that you have
          entered on your Watch List, the description will appear on your
          Watch List ruling report and an automatic e-mail message will be
          sent to the contact person specified in your application. The
          e-mail will include all of the information contained in the
          ruling entry, i.e., caption, case number, date, judge's name, a
          brief summary of the ruling, and a link or location for the full
          text of the document where available.

          You must have the case number for Watch List to function. Do not
          send e-mail requests for information about cases. If you need a
          case number or other information you must conduct the request
          through the Clerk of Court, Records Management office, and pay
          any required search fee. There is no fee for using CourtWeb or
          for a Watch List account.

          Only one account will be opened for each firm, with one contact
          person who is then responsible for disseminating the information
          within the organization. For a medium to large size firm, the
          contact person is generally the managing clerk or managing
          attorney.

          You will receive your user name, password and instructions by
          e-mail, after your application has been submitted and processed.
          The new account information will include the address for the
          Watch List log-in page. Since this is a private screen for Watch
          List accounts only, it is not linked to any other pages in the
          SDNY Web site, or to the public CourtWeb pages.

   Lost Watch List Log-in Info?

          If you have lost or forgotten your Watch List user name,
          password, or log-in page address, send an e-mail to
          sdny_webadmin@ce2.uscourts.gov and specify the information you
          need. Please identify your firm or user name when you e-mail or
          call so that your account information can be looked up.

   Change of Address for Watch List

          If any of your Watch List account information changes,
          particularly the e-mail address and phone number, please e-mail
          the updated information to the webadmin.
