   GENERAL ORDER #1 PLAN FOR THE COMPOSITION, ADMINISTRATION AND
   MANAGEMENT OF THE PANEL OF PRIVATE ATTORNEYS AND THE OFFICE OF THE
   FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER UNDER THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT DATED: DECEMBER
   14,2001 Doc. Creation Date: 12/14/01 I. AUTHORITY. Pursuant to the
   Criminal Justice Act of 1964, as amended, (CJA), section 3006A of title
   18, United States Code, and the Guidelines for the Administration of
   the Criminal Justice Act and Related Statutes (CJA Guidelines), Volume
   VII, Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures (CJA Guidelines), the
   judges of the United States District Court for the Northern District of
   New York, adopt this Plan for furnishing representation in federal
   court for any person financially unable to obtain adequate
   representation in accordance with the Criminal Justice Act. II.
   STATEMENT OF POLICY. A. Objectives. 1. The objective of the Plan is to
   attain equality before the law for all persons. Therefore, this Plan
   shall be administered so that those accused of a crime, or otherwise
   eligible for services pursuant to the CJA, will not be deprived,
   because they are financially unable to pay for adequate representation,
   or for any service necessary to an adequate defense. 2. The further
   objective of this Plan is to particularize the requirements of the CJA,
   the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (codified in part at §848(q) of title
   21, United States Code), and the CJA Guidelines in a way that meets the
   needs of this District. B. Compliance. 1. The Court, its Clerk, the
   Federal Public Defender Organization (FPD), and private attorneys
   appointed under the CJA shall comply with the CJA Guidelines approved
   by the Judicial Conference of the United States and/or its Committee on
   Defender Services and with this Plan. 2. The Clerk of Court shall
   provide each private attorney with a current copy of this Plan upon the
   attorney's first appointment under the CJA or designation as a member
   of the panel of private attorneys under the Criminal Justice Act (CJA
   Panel). The clerk shall maintain a current copy of the CJA Guidelines
   for the use of members of the CJA Panel and shall make known to such
   attorneys its availability. 1 III. DEFINITIONS. A. "Representation"
   includes counsel and investigative, expert, and other services. B.
   "Appointed attorney," members of the panel of private attorneys (CJA
   Panel) who are eligible and willing to be appointed to provide
   representation under the Criminal Justice Act, the Federal Public
   Defender and staff attorneys of the Federal Public Defender, and
   private attorneys when needed to supplement the CJA Panel. IV.
   PROVISION OF REPRESENTATION. A. Circumstance. 1. Mandatory.
   Representation shall be provided for any financially eligible person
   who: a. is charged with a felony or with a Class A misdemeanor; b. is a
   juvenile alleged to have committed an act of juvenile delinquency as
   defined in §5031 of title 18, U.S.C.; c. is charged with a violation of
   probation, or faces a change of a term or condition of probation
   (unless the modification sought is favorable to the probationer and the
   government has not objected to the proposed change); d. is under
   arrest, when such representation is required by law; e. is entitled to
   appointment of counsel in parole proceedings; f. is charged with a
   violation of supervised release or faces modification, reduction, or
   enlargement of a condition, or extension or revocation of a term of
   supervised release; g. is subject to a mental condition hearing under
   chapter 313 of title 18, U.S.C.; h. is in custody as a material
   witness; 2 i. is seeking to set aside or vacate a death sentence under
   §2254 or §2255 of title 28, U.S.C.; j. is entitled to appointment of
   counsel in verification of consent proceedings pursuant to a transfer
   of an offender to or from the United States for the execution of a
   penal sentence under §4109 of title 18, U.S.C.; k. is entitled to
   appointment of counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution;
   or l. faces loss of liberty in a case and federal law requires the
   appointment of counsel. 2. Discretionary. Whenever a judge or United
   States magistrate judge determines that the interests of justice so
   require, representation may be provided for any financially eligible
   person who: a. is charged with a petty offense (Class B or C
   misdemeanor, or an infraction), for which a sentence to confinement is
   authorized; b. is seeking relief, other than to set aside or vacate a
   death sentence under §2241, §2254, or §2255 of title 28, U.S.C.; c. is
   charged with civil or criminal contempt who faces the loss of liberty;
   d. has been called as a witness before a grand jury, a court, the
   Congress, or a federal agency or commission which has the power to
   compel testimony, and there is reason to believe, either prior to or
   during testimony, that the witness could be subject to a criminal
   prosecution, a civil or criminal contempt proceeding, or face loss of
   liberty; e. is proposed by the United States attorney for processing
   under a pretrial diversion program; f. is held for international
   extradition under chapter 209 of title 18, U.S.C. Representation may
   also be furnished for financially eligible persons in ancillary matters
   appropriate to the proceedings pursuant to subsection C of the CJA
   Plan. 3 B. When Counsel Shall be Provided. Counsel shall be provided to
   eligible persons as soon as feasible after they are taken into custody,
   when they appear before a judge or magistrate judge, when they are
   formally charged or notified of charges if formal charges are sealed,
   or when a judge or magistrate judge otherwise considers appointment of
   counsel appropriate under the CJA, whichever occurs earliest. C. Number
   and Qualifications of Counsel. 1. Number. More than one attorney may be
   appointed in any case determined by the court to be extremely
   difficult. In a capital case, the following applies: a. Federal Capital
   Prosecutions. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3005, a person charged with a
   capital offense is entitled to the appointment of two attorneys, at
   least one of whom shall be learned in the law applicable to capital
   cases. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. §848(q)(4), if necessary for adequate
   representation, more then two attorneys may be appointed to represent a
   defendant in such a case. b. Habeas Corpus Proceedings. Pursuant to 21
   U.S.C. Section 848 (q)(4), a financially eligible person seeking to
   vacate or set aside a death sentence in proceedings under 28 U.S.C.
   §2254 or §2255 is entitled to appointment of one or more qualified
   attorneys. Due to the complex, demanding, and protracted nature of
   death penalty proceedings, judicial officers should consider appointing
   at least two counsel. 4 2. Qualifications. Qualifications for appointed
   counsel shall be determined by the court. In capital cases, the
   following also applies: a. Appointment of Counsel Prior to Judgement.
   Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. §848 (q)(5), at least one of the attorneys
   appointed must have been admitted to practice in the court in which the
   case will be prosecuted for not less then five years, and must have had
   not less than three years experience in the actual trial of felony
   prosecutions in that court. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3005, at least one
   of the attorneys appointed must be knowledgeable in the law applicable
   to capital cases. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3005, in appointing counsel in
   federal capital prosecutions, the court shall consider the
   recommendation of the Federal Public Defender. b. Appointment of
   Counsel After Judgment. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. §848(q)(6), at least one
   of the attorneys appointed must have been admitted to practice in the
   court of appeals for not less then five years, and must have had not
   less than three years experience in the handling of appeals in felony
   cases in the court. c. Attorney Qualification Waiver. Pursuant to 21
   U.S.C. §848(q)(7), the presiding judicial officer, for good cause, may
   appoint an attorney who may not qualify under 21 U.S.C. §848(q)(5) or
   (q)(6), but who has the background, knowledge, and experience necessary
   to represent the defendant properly in a capital case, giving due
   consideration to the seriousness of the possible penalty and the unique
   and complex nature of the litigation. 5 D. Eligibility for
   Representation. 1. Factfinding. The determination of eligibility for
   representation under the CJA is a judicial function to be performed by
   a federal judge or magistrate judge after making appropriate inquires
   concerning the person's financial condition. 2. Disclosure of Change in
   Eligibility. If, at any time after appointment, counsel obtains
   information that a client is financially able to make payment, in whole
   or in part, for legal or other services in connection with his or her
   representation, and the source of the attorney's information is not
   protected as a privileged communication, counsel shall advise the
   court. V. FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER. 2. Establishment. a. The Federal
   Public Defender Office for the Northern District of New York and
   District of Vermont, previously established on September 29, 1997
   pursuant to the provisions of the CJA, is hereby recognized as the
   Federal Public Defender Organization for this district. b. The Federal
   Public Defender shall be capable of providing legal services throughout
   the Northern District of New York and throughout the District of
   Vermont. 3. Supervision of Defender Office. The Federal Public Defender
   shall be responsible for the supervision and management of the Federal
   Public Defender Office. Accordingly, the Federal Pubic Defender shall
   be appointed in all cases assigned to that organization for subsequent
   assignment to staff attorneys at the discretion of the Federal Public
   Defender. VI. PRIVATE ATTORNEYS. A. Establishment of CJA Panel. The
   existing previously established panel of attorneys (CJA Panel) who are
   eligible and willing to be appointed to provide representation under
   the CJA will be considered for membership on the CJA Panel. 6 B.
   Organization. The Plan for the composition, administration, and
   management of the Panel of private attorneys under the Criminal Justice
   Act is found at Appendix I of this CJA Plan. C. Ratio of Appointments.
   Where practical and cost effective, private attorneys from the CJA
   Panel shall be appointed in a substantial proportion of the cases in
   which the accused is determined to be financially eligible for
   representation under the CJA. "Substantial" shall usually be defined as
   approximately 25% of the appointments under the CJA annually throughout
   the district. VII. REPRESENTATION IN STATE DEATH PENALTY HABEAS CORPUS
   PROCEEDINGS UNDER 28 U.S.C. §2254. The Court shall appoint a member or
   members of the Special Death Penalty Habeas Corpus Panel, or the
   Federal Public Defender with his or her consent, or a qualified
   attorney recommended by the Federal Public Defender, or any other
   attorney who qualifies for appointment pursuant to §848(q) of title 21,
   United States Code to represent financially eligible persons seeking
   habeas corpus relief in state death penalty proceedings under §2254 of
   title 28, United States Code. VIII. DUTIES OF APPOINTED COUNSEL. A.
   Standards. The services to be rendered to a person represented by
   appointed counsel shall be commensurate with those rendered if counsel
   were privately employed by the person. B. Professional Conduct.
   Attorneys appointed pursuant to the CJA shall conform to the highest
   standards of professional conduct, including but not limited to the
   provisions of the New York State Lawyer's Code of Professional
   Responsibilities, as adopted from time to time by the Appellate
   Divisions of the State of New York, and as interpreted and applied by
   the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and any
   other standards for professional conduct adopted by this court. C. No
   Receipt of Other Payment. Appointed counsel may not require, request,
   or accept any payment or promise of payment or any other valuable
   consideration for representation under the appointment, unless such
   payment is approved by order of the court. 7 D. Continuing
   Representation. Once counsel is appointed under the CJA, counsel shall
   continue the representation until the matter, including appeals or
   review by certiorari (as governed by the circuit CJA Plan provisions
   concerning representation on appeal), is closed; until substitute
   counsel has filed a notice of appearance; until an order has been
   entered allowing or requiring the person represented to proceed pro se;
   or until the appointment is terminated by court order. G. Pro Bono
   Panel. In recognition of the need for representation of indigent
   parties in civil actions, this Court has established the Pro Bono Panel
   of the Northern District of New York. The Panel shall include members
   of the CJA Panel in this Court. Any other attorney admitted to practice
   in this Court shall also be expected to participate in periodic
   training as offered by the Court and to accept no more than one Pro
   Bono assignment per year. IX. DUTIES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND RELATED
   AGENCIES. A. Presentation of Accused for Appointment of Counsel.
   Federal law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies, probation officers,
   and pretrial services officers in this district, and those acting on
   their behalf, shall promptly inform any person who is in custody, or
   who otherwise may be entitled to counsel under the CJA, of their right
   to counsel, prior to any questioning, and that counsel shall be
   provided without cost if the person is unable to afford counsel. If the
   person requests counsel, federal law enforcement and prosecutorial
   agencies are encouraged to inform the person promptly of the existence
   of the Federal Public Defender Office and how to contact it, regardless
   of whether the Federal Public Defender may ultimately be appointed in
   their defense. In instances where the person indicates that he or she
   is not able to secure private representation, the Federal Public
   Defender shall be promptly notified. In such cases in which the person
   indicates that he or she is not financially able to secure
   representation, the Federal Public Defender shall discuss with the
   person the right to representation and right to appointed counsel, and
   if appointment seems likely, assist in the completion of a financial
   affidavit (CJA Form 23) and arrange to have the person promptly
   presented before a magistrate judge or judge of this Court for
   determination of financial eligibility and appointment of counsel. Law
   enforcement and related agencies must also comply with the provisions
   of Local Rule 5.1 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure for the Northern
   District of New York. 8 B. Pretrial Services Interview. This Court
   recognizes the importance of the advice of counsel for persons subject
   to proceeding under 18 U.S.C. §3142 et seq., prior to their being
   interviewed by a pretrial services or probation officer. Accordingly,
   the United States Attorney shall include notification to the accused
   with the issuance of any criminal summons or appearance letter of their
   obligation to contact the Pretrial Services Office for the Northern
   District of New York at least forty-eight hours prior to their
   scheduled appearance with the Court to arrange for a pretrial services
   report to be completed. If the accused does not have retained counsel,
   the notification shall also include contact information for the office
   of the Federal Public Defender. Upon execution of an arrest warrant,
   law enforcement and related agencies shall comply with the requirements
   set forth in IX A. Early notification to the Federal Public Defender
   and Pretrial Services office will assist in the furnishing of appointed
   counsel at this stage of the proceedings to financially eligible
   defendants, having due regard for the importance of affording the
   pretrial services officer adequate time to interview the defendant and
   verify information prior to the initial appearance and bail hearing. C.
   Notice of Indictment or Criminal Information. Upon the return or
   unsealing of an indictment, the filing of a criminal information, or
   the filing of a petition to modify or revoke probation, the United
   States Attorney shall mail or otherwise deliver a copy of the document
   to appointed counsel, or to the defendant if he or she is without
   counsel, at the address shown on defendant's bond papers or to the jail
   in which the defendant is incarcerated. X. MISCELLANEOUS. A. Forms.
   Standard forms, pertaining to the CJA and approved by the Judicial
   Conference of the United States or its Committee on Defender Services
   and prescribed and distributed by the Director of the Administrative
   Office of the United States Courts, shall be used, where applicable, in
   all proceedings under this Plan. B. Claims. Claims for compensation of
   private attorneys providing representation under the CJA shall be
   submitted on the appropriate CJA form to the office of the Clerk of the
   court. That office shall review the claim form for mathematical and
   technical accuracy, and for conformity with the CJA Guidelines, and, if
   correct, shall forward the claim form for the consideration of the
   appropriate judge or magistrate judge. The Court may also direct the
   Office of the Federal Public Defender to review claim forms for
   mathematical and technical accuracy, and for conformity with the CJA
   Guidelines. The court will exert its best effort to avoid delays in
   reviewing payment vouchers and in submitting them for further
   processing. C. Supersession. This Plan supersedes all prior Criminal
   Justice Act Plans for this court. 9 XI. Effective Date. This Plan and
   Appendix I, the Plan for the composition, administration, and
   management of the Panel of private attorneys under the CJA shall become
   effective when approved by the Judicial Council of the Second Circuit.
   SO ORDERED FOR THE COURT ON December 14th, 2001 S/ Frederick J.
   Scullin, Jr. Chief Judge Frederick J. Scullin, Jr. - NDNY APPROVED BY
   THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT ON January 17, 2002 Doc.
   Creation Date 12/14/01 10 APPENDIX - I. UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
   for the NORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK PLAN FOR THE COMPOSITION,
   ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PANEL OF PRIVATE ATTORNEYS UNDER
   THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT I. COMPOSITION OF THE PANEL OF PRIVATE
   ATTORNEYS. A. CJA PANEL. 1. Approval. The Court shall establish a panel
   of private attorneys (hereinafter referred to as the "CJA Panel") who
   are eligible and willing to be appointed to provide representation
   under the Criminal Justice Act. The Court shall approve attorneys for
   membership on the panel on a quarterly basis after receiving
   recommendations from the "Panel Selection Committee," established
   pursuant to paragraph B of this Plan. Members of the CJA Panel shall
   serve at the pleasure of the Court. 2. Size. The Court shall fix,
   periodically, the size of the CJA Panel. The panel shall be large
   enough to provide a sufficient number of experienced attorneys to
   handle the CJA caseload, yet small enough so that panel members will
   receive an adequate number of appointments to maintain their
   proficiency in federal criminal defense work, and thereby provide a
   high quality of representation. 3. Eligibility. Attorneys who serve on
   the CJA Panel must be members in good standing of the federal bar of
   this district, and have demonstrated experience in, and knowledge of,
   the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Federal Rules of Evidence,
   and the Sentencing Guidelines. Appendix I - Page #1 Subsection (b) of
   the Act provides, in part, that; Counsel furnishing representation
   under the plan shall be selected from a panel of attorneys designated
   or approved by the court, or from a bar association, legal aid agency,
   or defender organization furnishing representation pursuant to the
   Plan. However, when the district judge or magistrate judge presiding
   over the case, or the chief judge if a district judge or magistrate
   judge has not yet been assigned to the case, determines that the
   appointment of an attorney, who is not a member of the CJA panel, is in
   the interest of justice, judicial economy or continuity of
   representation, or there is some other compelling circumstance
   warranting his or her appointment, the attorney may be admitted to the
   CJA panel pro hac vice and appointed to represent the CJA defendant.
   Consideration for preserving the integrity of the panel selection
   process suggests that such appointments should be made only in
   exceptional circumstances. Further, the attorney, who may or may not
   maintain an office in the district, should possess such qualities as
   would qualify him or her for admission to the district's CJA panel in
   the ordinary course of panel selection. 4. Equal Opportunity. All
   qualified attorneys shall be encouraged to participate in the
   furnishing of representation in CJA cases, without regard to race,
   color, religion, sex, age, national origin or disabling condition.
   Notice of the opportunity to apply for membership on the CJA Panel
   shall be provided to attorneys at the time of admission to the bar of
   this Court. The applications shall also be available at the office of
   the Clerk and on the Court's Web Page. (www.nynd.uscourts.gov) 5.
   Terms. CJA Panel members shall serve at the pleasure of the court.
   Members of the panel shall serve continuously until they resign or are
   removed from the panel. 6. Removal from the Panel. Membership on the
   CJA Panel is a privilege, not a right, which may be terminated at any
   time by the Board of Judges, as they, in their sole discretion, may
   determine. 7. Application. Application forms for membership on the CJA
   Panel shall be m a d e available, upon request, by the Clerk of the
   Court. Completed applications shall be submitted to the Clerk of the
   Court who will transmit the applications to the Court for review and
   approval on a quarterly basis. Appendix I - Page #2 B. CJA PANEL
   COMMITTEE. 1. Membership. A CJA Panel Committee shall be established by
   the Court. The NDNY Committee shall consist of two magistrate judges,
   the Federal Public Defender, two attorneys from the Syracuse and Albany
   Divisions, and one from the Binghamton office. The Clerk of Court or
   Chief Deputy Clerk shall serve as an ad hoc member of the Committee to
   provide administrative support. The Committee shall be chaired by one
   of the magistrate judges appointed. 2. Duties. a. The Committee shall
   be responsible for the oversight of the CJA Panel and the Criminal
   Justice Act Plan. At least once annually, the Committee shall review
   the operation and administration of the panel and make recommendations
   to the Court as to any necessary changes to the CJA Plan. The Committee
   shall also ascertain the continued availability and willingness of each
   panel member to accept appointments. The Committee may also make
   recommendations to the Court with respect to appointment of new panel
   members or the removal of existing panel members. The Clerk of Court
   shall provide the Committee with all relevant information concerning
   the assignment of panel members. b. The Committee shall assist the
   Court by working with local bar associations regarding recruitment
   efforts in furtherance of the Equal Opportunity statement in Paragraph
   I.A.4 of this Plan. The Clerk of Court will assist the Committee by: 1.
   Notifying bar associations and advertising in legal journals to solicit
   participation of qualified practioners who are female, disabled or a
   member of some other minority; 2. Contacting current or former members
   of the panel, as well as prominent local attorneys to seek
   recommendations for appointment to the panel of qualified applicants
   who are female, disabled or a member of some other minority. Appendix I
   - Page #3 C. CJA TRAINING PANEL - 2ND CHAIR PROGRAM. The Court in its
   discretion, may establish a "CJA Training Panel - 2nd Chair Program,"
   consisting of attorneys who do not have the experience required for
   membership on the CJA Panel. Training Panel members may be assigned by
   the Court to assist members of the CJA Panel, or Federal Public
   Defender in a voluntary "second chair" capacity. Training Panel members
   are not eligible to receive appointments independently, and shall not
   be eligible to receive compensation for their services in assisting CJA
   Panel members. Prior service on the CJA Training Panel - 2nd Chair
   Program is not a requirement for membership on the CJA Panel, nor will
   service on the Training Panel guarantee admission of an attorney to the
   CJA Panel. II SELECTION FOR APPOINTMENT A. MAINTENANCE OF LIST AND
   DISTRIBUTION OF CJA APPOINTMENTS. The Clerk of the Court shall maintain
   a current list of all attorneys included on the CJA Panel, with current
   office addresses, telephone and fax numbers, e:mail addresses, as well
   as a statement of qualifications and experience. The Clerk shall
   furnish a copy of this list to each judge and magistrate judge, the
   list shall also be made available to the Federal Public Defender. The
   Clerk shall also maintain a public record of assignments to private
   counsel, and, when appropriate, statistical data reflecting the
   proration of appointments between attorneys from the Federal Public
   Defender Organization and private attorneys, according to the formula
   described in the CJA Plan for the District. The Clerk of Court shall
   also maintain a record of each refusal ("pass") by a panel attorney,
   and the reason for each pass. If the Clerk's Office determines that a
   panel member has repeatedly passed assignments, the Clerk may refer the
   name of the attorney to the Court. The Court shall then consider the
   information provided by the Clerk and make such further inquiry as it
   deems appropriate. B. METHOD OF SELECTION. Appointments from the list
   of private attorneys should be made on a rotational basis, subject to
   the Court's discretion to make exceptions due to the nature and
   complexity of the case, an attorney's experience, and geographical
   considerations. This procedure should result in a balanced distribution
   of appointments and compensation among the members of the CJA Panel,
   and quality representation for each CJA defendant. Appendix I - Page #4
   Upon the determination of a need for the appointment of counsel, the
   judge or magistrate judge shall notify the Clerk of Court, or Federal
   Public Defender of the need for counsel and the nature of the case. The
   Clerk of Court shall advise the judge or magistrate judge as to the
   status of distribution of cases, where appropriate, as between the
   Federal Public Defender and the panel of private attorneys. If the
   judge or magistrate judge decides to appoint an attorney from the
   panel, the Clerk shall determine the name of the next panel member on
   the list who is available for appointment, and shall provide the name
   to the appointing judge or magistrate judge. In the event of an
   emergency, i.e., weekends, holidays, or other non-working hours of the
   Clerk of Court's office, the presiding judge, or magistrate judge, may
   appoint any attorney from the list if a member of the Federal Public
   Defender's Office is not available. In all cases where members of the
   CJA Panel are appointed out of sequence, the appointing judge or
   magistrate judge shall notify the Clerk of Court, or Federal Public
   Defender as to the name of the attorney appointed and the date of the
   appointment. C. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. If after appointment, counsel
   learns that a client is financially able to pay all or part of the fee
   for legal representation and the source of the attorney's information
   is not a privileged communication, counsel shall so advise the
   presiding judge. The presiding judge will take appropriate action,
   including but not limited to: permitting assigned counsel to continue
   to represent the defendant; terminating the appointment of counsel, or
   ordering any funds available to the party to be paid as provided in 18
   U.S.C. section 3006A(f) as the interests of justice may dictate. Any
   amount paid by the party will be considered by the presiding judge in
   determining the total compensation allowed to the attorney. D.
   INVESTIGATIVE, EXPERT AND OTHER SERVICES. 1. Upon Request. Counsel for
   a party who is financially unable to obtain investigative, expert or
   other services necessary for an adequate defense may request such
   services ex parte before a judge or magistrate judge having
   jurisdiction over the case. Such application shall be heard in camera
   and shall not be revealed without the consent of the defendant. On
   finding that the services are necessary and that the person is
   financially unable to afford them, the judge or magistrate judge shall
   authorize them. An order setting forth the type, purpose, and
   limitations of such services will be issued by the Court. The judge or
   magistrate judge may establish a limit on the amount that may be
   expended or committed for such services within the maximum prescribed
   by 18 U.S.C. section 3006A(e)(3). Appendix I - Page #5 2. Without Prior
   Request. Counsel appointed pursuant to this Plan may obtain subject to
   later review, investigative, expert, or other services without prior
   judicial authorization if they are necessary for an adequate defense.
   The total cost of services so obtained may not exceed the maximum
   prescribed by 18 U.S.C. section 3006(A)(e)(2) per individual or
   corporation providing the services (exclusive of reasonable expenses).
   However, in the interests of justice and upon finding that timely
   procurement of necessary services could not await prior authorization,
   a judge or magistrate judge (in a case entirely disposed of by the
   magistrate judge) may approve payment for such services after they have
   been obtained, even if the services exceed the maximum prescribed by 18
   U.S.C. section 3006(A)(e)(2). 3. Necessity of Affidavit. Statements
   made by or on behalf of the party in support of requests for
   investigative, expert, and other services shall be made or supported by
   affidavit and filed with the Court in-camera for review and
   consideration. E. COMPENSATION - FILING OF VOUCHERS. Claims for
   compensation shall be submitted on the appropriate CJA form accompanied
   by the CJA voucher worksheets to the office of the Clerk of Court. That
   office shall review the claim form for mathematical and technical
   accuracy, and for conformity with the Guidelines for the Administration
   of the Criminal Justice Act (Volume VII, Guide to Judiciary Policies
   and Procedures) and, if correct, shall forward the claim form for the
   consideration of the appropriate judge or magistrate judge. The Court
   may also direct the Office of the Federal Public Defender to review
   claim forms for mathematical and technical accuracy, and for conformity
   with the CJA Guidelines. The court will exert its best effort to avoid
   delays in reviewing payment vouchers and in submitting them for further
   processing. 1. Maximum Amounts for Counsel. For representation of a
   defendant before a magistrate judge or judge of this court, or both,
   the compensation paid any attorney shall not exceed the maximum
   prescribed by 18 U.S.C. section 3006A(d)(2). 2. Waiver of Limits on
   Counsel Fees. Payment in excess of any maximum amount prescribed by 18
   U.S.C. section 3006A(d)(2) for counsel fees or for other services may
   be made for extended or complex representation whenever the judge or
   magistrate judge (if the representation was entirely before the
   magistrate judge) certifies that the amount sought is necessary to
   provide fair compensation and the payment is approved by the Chief
   Judge of the Second Circuit or such active Circuit Judge to whom the
   Chief Judge has delegated approval authority. Counsel claiming such
   excess payment shall submit a detailed memorandum justifying counsel's
   claim that the representation was in an extended or complex case and
   that the excess payment is necessary to provide fair compensation.
   Appendix I - Page #6 3. Reduction of CJA Payment. In any case where the
   judge or magistrate judge intends to reduce the amount of payment
   requested in a voucher, the CJA attorney shall be notified of the
   amount of the intended reduction, and may request an opportunity for
   review by the judicial officer. After review of any submission by
   appointed counsel and the completion of any steps deemed appropriate by
   the court, the judicial officer shall then take action on the voucher
   consistent with this Plan, the CJA, and the interests of justice.
