   From DIA: Exit the airport on Pe√±a Boulevard, to I-70 westbound. Exit
   I-70 onto I-270, then follow the signs to State Highway 36 to Boulder.
   As 36 drops down into Boulder, watch for the Baseline Road exit to the
   left. Exit and turn left onto Baseline, then left again onto 27th Way.
   Stay in the right lane to go straight through the signal at Broadway.
   Now you are on the Department of Commerce Campus, including offices of
   the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and NOAA.
   Turn left at the NIST building and follow Lawrence Road around to the
   stop sign, then turn left onto Compton Road. This will lead you around
   to the David Skaggs Research Center (DSRC) parking lot. Enter through
   the main entrace at the center of the west side of the building and get
   a temporary parking pass from the security desk.
