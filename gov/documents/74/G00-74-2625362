         Because the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is a user center of propulsion
         systems, a program in advanced deep space propulsion is essential at
         JPL to expedite the adoption of new propulsion technologies. The
         Advanced Propulsion Technology (APT) Group at JPL performs two
         principal functions. First, it provides technological expertise for
         planetary and deep-space robotic mission planners in support of current
         and near term flight projects. This expertise is geared toward reducing
         cost and mission time for spacecraft that would otherwise use
         conventional chemical propulsion systems. Specific examples of recent
         project support include an 8000 hour endurance test of a Xenon Ion
         Engine for use on the Deep Space I flight project, launched in October
         of 1998.

         The second function of the Advanced Propulsion Technology Group is to
         identify and evaluate, through experiment and simulation, the
         feasibility of advanced propulsion concepts that may lead to
         significant advances in space transportation capability. Such new
         propulsion systems will be necessary to enable fast robotic exploration
         of the solar system (including sample return missions, outer planet
         orbiters and landers) and of the local interstellar neighborhood.

         The mission statement of the Advanced Propulsion Concepts activity is
         to:
           * Identify advanced deep space propulsion concepts which offer
             theoretical performance significantly superior to that of
             state-of-the-art propulsion systems
           * Evaluate the feasibility of these concepts through experiment and
             analysis
           * Provide guidance for NASA's investment strategy in advanced
             propulsion technology development

         The objectives of the APT Group are pursued through a combination of
         in-house research, University contracts, and industry partnerships.
