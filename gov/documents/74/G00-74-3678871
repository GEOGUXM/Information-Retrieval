 _______________________________________________________________________

 The last week of November, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
 confirmed the presence of Mediterranean fruit flies (Medfly) in
 clementines from Spain. USDA suspended the importation of clementines
 from Spain and informed Spanish officials that no additional
 clementines would be allowed entry. Clementines shipments currently en
 route to the United States will not be allowed entry.

 APHIS has identified 17 States (Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California,
 Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Nevada, New
 Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and
 Washington) and Puerto Rico where Spanish clementines will be recalled.
 This includes all of the citrus-producing States and a buffer zone
 around those States. States included in the recall can destroy the
 fruit or move it out of the recall area.

 In addition to the immediate actions identified above, USDA is sending
 a delegation to Spain next week, including Federal and State officials.
 The delegation will look at orchards, packing operations, and
 inspection activities. The delegation will examine whether Spain can
 demonstrate the ability to ship clementines without risk to the U.S.
 agriculture.

 Medflies are one of the world's most destructive agricultural pests,
 threatening more than 250 kinds of fruits, nuts, and vegetables. If the
 Medfly were to become established, consumer prices would go up and
 produce would become less available. In addition, backyard gardens, as
 well as commercial production areas, would require increased use of
 pesticides on a routine basis. The United States currently has no
 established Medfly populations, and USDA is remaining vigilant in its
 efforts to prevent the introduction of this pest. This pest poses no
 human health threat.
