                         Outward Processing Program
   Effective January 1, 2000, CITA has established a new Outward
   Processing Program with Romania and Macedonia. This program differs
   from the Special Access Program in several key ways: 1) It only applies
   to wool apparel categories from Romania and Macedonia. 2) If desired,
   goods may be cut and sewn in beneficiary countries from U.S.-formed
   fabrics (instead of only assembled in a beneficiary country from U.S.
   formed and cut fabrics). Of course, the 9802 tariff reduction
   provisions do not apply to fabric that was not cut in the U.S. into
   components. Thus, full duty applicable to the apparel is likely to be
   required; no reduction is provided for the use of U.S. fabric if it was
   not cut in the U.S. Alternatively, goods may be assembled in the
   beneficiary country under the exact same duty and quota provisions
   applicable to the Special Access Program. In other respects, including
   documentation requirements and enforcement, the Outward Processing
   Program is similar to the Special Access Program. The specific
   requirements are outlined in two Federal Register Notices published in
   64 FR 69746 (December 14, 1999).
