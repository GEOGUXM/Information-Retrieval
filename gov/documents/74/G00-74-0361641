                    SeaWiFS Project Software - Major Changes

   This is a logfile to record major changes to the SeaWiFS data
   processing software.
     __________________________________________________________________


Date:   2/20/97
Desc:   Update to Anly.  This change to removes many of the large chlorophyll
        values that are seen in the level-2 to level-3 data.  There are
        now checks put in to fail the pixel id the total radiance is <= 0
        or if the total - Rayleigh is <= 0.  In either case, the atmospheric
        correction failure flag is set.  It was also discovered that for
        GAC data, the 2 pixel uncorrectable distance did not supercede
        the stray light distance sent in.  Thus, to mask out the uncorrectable
        pixels in the GAC, we must now use a stray light distance of 8.

        (note that the stray light distance change will be fixed in the inputs
        to anly: 8, .25 for GAC )


Date:   2/17/97
Desc:   Updated the c_chlor_v1p3.dat files used by Anly.  The new file sets the
        'pk' factor used in the Carder algorithm to 0 instead of 3, which
        should make a chlorophyll product that is closer to the SeaBAM
        chlorophyll.  This will only affect the QC product.

        The c_chlor_v1p3.c source file was updated to fix the Carder chlorophyll
        routine so it will work with all the different packaging options.  Befor
e,
        a bug fixed it to only use pk = 0 always.


Date:   12/30/97
Desc:   Update to SWl01.  This change will limit the occurrences of 999 values
        in the elon, elat, slon, slat, clon, clat fields, correct averaging
        logic, set larger smoothing interval for LAC and HRPT data, and
        increase the consistency tolerance for the Sun sensor data.


Date:   12/19/97
Desc:   Update to anly8d.  This is a change to modify the chlorophyll
        algorithm and to treat negative water leaving radiances differently.
        The chlorophyll algorithm has 2 changes.  First, if either nLw490 or
        nLw555 are < 0, set the chlorophyll to 0 rather than .01 as was done
        before this change.  Second, if the computed chlorophyll is < .01,
        set the CZCS pigment to 1.34 * .01 ^ 0.98 instead of the value .01
        as was done before.

        The treatment of the negative water leaving radiances has 2 parts.
        First, if a pixel has the negative water leaving radiance flag on,
        look at the shallow water flag for that pixel.  If it is not shallow,
        set the cloud / ice flag.  In open ocean, the most likely cause for
        negative water leaving radiances is cloud contamination.  In coastal
        (shallow) areas, the turbid water can confuse the atmospheric correction
        into overestimating the aerosol radiance and giving negative water
        leaving radiance.  With this scheme, the likely cloud areas will be
        flagged while coastal areas will not end up haloed by a false cloud
        signal.
        Second, to accomplish this, we have gone to a better (hopefully) shallow
        water mask.  This mask is the same format as the land mask: 128 X 128
        samples per degree.  The ETOPO5 data was mapped into this format.
        Although the ETOPO5 data is only 5 minute resolution, we expect to
        fill in, where possible with higher resolution bathemetery data in
        the future.  The data was also modified so that if any land occurred
        in the 5 minute square area, that area would be designated as shallow
        water.  This had to be done because the ETOPO5 has the average depth
        and it is possible that an area of ocean with a small island will
        end up with an average depth < 30 m.


Date:   12/10/97
Desc:   Updates to the SeaWiFS navigational software were installed to address
        the following issues:

        - minor changes to the SeaWiFS instrument alignment
        - updates to the sensor scan geometry
        - corrected a bug which was
          interfering with the detection of noisy data; should have no
          effect on clean data.
        - added a check to prevent noisy tilt telemetry from being used in
          the tilt state logic.

Date:   12/8/97
Desc:   New calibration table was installed (SEAWIFS_SENSOR_CAL.TBL-199712).
        The new table is based on the current vicarious calibration analysis
        and contains the latest calibration coefficients, so the Anly8d flags
        CALMOD_FLG and CALMOD_OFF should be set to 0 until further notice
        when using this table.

Date:   12/4/97
Desc:   The level-2 browse-generating program was modified, so that level-2
        browse files can be created for LAC data.

Date:   12/2/97
Desc:   Installed updated unit for the navigational software, navtlm.f, to
        correct the tilt indexing logic for the case when a scan with no tilt
        telemetry (one out of every three scan lines) occurs at the start of
        a tilt change.  It should otherwise have no effect on navigation.

Date:   11/28/97
Desc:   Installed new version of SeaWiFS Level-0 to Level-1A processing software
        called SWl01.  This new version is much more robust than the original
        version, implementing new logic that deals with many of the real-data
        problems that have caused the original L01 software to fail.  The
        level-1A file created by SWl01 differ from those created by l1agen in
        the following ways:
                - No more filled frames
                - The following L1A fields are no longer used:
                        - Filled Scan Lines
                        - FF Missing Frames
                        - SDPS Missing Frames
                        - NORAD Line 1
                        - NORAD Line 2
                - HRPT passes and GAC orbits will never be broken into
                  multiple frames.
                - Navigation may differ, as SWl01 does some quality filtering
                  of the data that it passes to the orbit fitting and attitude
                  determination routines.
                - "Station Name" may not be "Wallops" for GAC data
                - "Software ID" is "1.0.1"
                - "Processing Control" contains a new commandline sequence
                  reflecting the new program.

        This software is subject to frequent update while it is in its early
        testing phase.  A log file that lists the change history for SWl01 can
        be viewed here.

Date:   11/25/97
Desc:   Installed new version of Anly.  The new version flags an atmospheric-
        algorithm failure.  If La_670 < 0, set the atmospheric algorithm failure
        flag.  It will also set La_670 = -1 if this happens.

Date:   11/20/97
Desc:   Installed new version of the level-1, true-color, tile-mapper software t
hat
        incorporates changes similar to those made to the level-1 browse program
        (make_tc_browse) described on 11/14/97.

        Installed updated version of the level-1 browse program to fix potential
        bugs and increase optimization.

Date:   11/20/97
Desc:   Installed new versions of the level-2 browse and level-2 PGM programs.
        The stray-light mask is now no longer applied when generating these
        products.

Date:   11/19/97
Desc:   Installed new version of Anly.  This is a change to modify the chlorophy
ll
        algorithm behavior.  For chlorophyll failure not > 32, set the chlorophy
ll
        and CZCS chlorophyll to .01.  Low chlor failure is the condition of
        chlorophyll <.01.  The following input parameters for Anly were modified
:

                HIGHTAU1 = .3
                SATZEN1 = 56.
                LOWLW1 = .15


Date:   11/14/97
Desc:   Installed a new version of the Level-1 Browse software.  The new version
        calibrates the level-1a data using Lakshmi and Wayne's
        calibrate_l1a() routine.  It then Rayleigh corrects the calibrated
        data with some code that I got from Eric Vermote.  The calibrated,
        Rayleigh-corrected data are finally logarithmically scaled, combined
        into an RGB image, and quantized down to 256 colors or less before
        being written into the HDF browse file as an 8-bit raster-plus-palette.

Date:   11/14/97
Desc:   Installed a new version of the Level-2 Browse software.  The new version
        causes the following masks to the chlorophyll data in the order shown.

        l2_flags bits set               resulting pixel value
        -----------------               ---------------------
        LAND1                           253

        EPSILON1,HIGHLT1,
        STRAYLIGHT1,CLDICE1,
        CHLOR1                          254

        SUNGLINT1                       252


        If the computed chlorophyll concentration is less than 0.01,
        then the pixel value is set to 251.

        All other values are logarithmically scaled to values between
        0 and 250.


Date:   11/13/97
Desc:   Installed new version of navigation software.  These modifications
        incorporate corrections to the tilt angles, which were determined to
        be needed following the nadir tilt test on Day 300.

Date:   11/12/97
Desc:   Added a renavigation step for the standard HRPT processing recipe to
        ensure that the HRPT files have the best possible navigation.  Apparentl
y
        not all of the remote sites have the l1agen built against the most-
        recent navigational software library.

Date:   11/12/97
Desc:   Installed a new version of the level-2 browse software.  This new
        version treats the stray-light bit in the l2_flags field of the
        level-2 data the same as the cloud-ice bit when generating browse
        imagery.

Date:   11/10/97
Desc:   Installed a new version of Anly (anly8dbl.rat).  This is a change to
        fix a bug found in anly by a SeaDAS user!  The computation of the
        solar radiance correction for time of year was not being done right
        because the hour of day, not the fraction of a day, was being added
        to the day of year to do the F0 correction.  Estimates are that this
        may lead to 1% errors in Lt.  A small GAC file (day 297) was processed
        and the nLw increased by 2.7 - 4.9 % and the chlor increased by 4.4%
        for a 12 Z file.  This would be doubled at the end of the day, where
        the MOBY data lies.

Date:   11/7/97
Desc:   Installed a new version of the Straylight software used by Anly.
        This is a change to have a modifiable stray light flag
        distance.  before, the first value in the stray light control
        was overridden by the value 14 and all uncorrectable pixels plus
        the corrected pixels out to 14 LAC pixels were flagged.  Now,
        the user has control over how many corrected pixels will be let
        through (be flagged).

Date:   11/7/97
Desc:   Modified the following parameter values for Anly
        STRAYLIGHT1 = (3, 0.25)
        CLDICE1 = 1.1
        MSKFLG = EPSILON1,LAND1,SUNGLINT1,HIGHLT1,CLDICE1
        CALMOD_FLAG = 0

        And the following ssbin-hdf parameters:
        FLAGUSE = "EPSILON1,LAND1,SUNGLINT1,HIGHLT1,SATZEN1,NEGLW1,STRAYLIGHT1,\
                   CLDICE1,COCCOLITH1,SOLZEN1,HIGHTAU1,LOWLW1,CHLOR1

Date:   11/3/97
Desc:   Installed new version of anly8d that processes data through the tilt
        changes.

        The old anly would not do any processing if the tilt state was 3
        (changing tilt) or not a valid tilt state (not 0 - 3).  The
        atmospheric correction algorithm failure flag would get set in
        these cases.  For a pixel in tilt state 3, the flag for atmospheric
        correction is not set -- thus, it will survive for further processing.

        Note that the current binner will exclude tilt state 3 so the tilt
        information will not get to the binned files, only the level-2.


Date:   10/16/97
Desc:   Installed new Anly source code that works with a new high-resolution
        land mask (~1 km), which was also installed.

Date:   10/16/97
Desc:   Changed the CLDICE1 flag for anly8d to 0.85 from its previous setting
        of 1.1.

Date:   10/16/97
Desc:   Installed new version of MOPS navigation routines earth.f and sunwgt.f
        to correct a minor bug in Earth oblateness and improve the weighting of
        the Sun sensor data respectively.  A new version of the navctl.dat
        navigation parameter file was installed that includes refinements to
        all sensor alignment matrices.

Date:   10/16/97
Desc:   Installed new level-1A browse software that makes true-color browse
        files from bands 1, 5, and 6 instead of just sampling band 8.  New
        metadata fields were added.

Date:   10/16/97
Desc:   Installed new level-2 browse software that puts additional metadata
        fields (navigation coordinates) in the browse file.

Date:   10/13/97
Desc:   Installed updated statistical-check tables for level-1A GAC and LAC
        that are less stringent with respect to line-to-line navigational
        thresholds.

Date:   10/10/97
Desc:   Installed updated statistical-check tables for level-1A GAC and LAC
        that are more stringent with respect to line-to-line navigational
        thresholds.

Date:   10/7/97
Desc:   Installed new version of MOPS navigation routine runfit3t.f to fix a
        bug introduced in the 10/3/97 installation.

Date:   10/6/97
Desc:   Modified Timebin GUI so that NDVI and Biosphere (BIOS) SMI images are
        created for binning periods > daily.

Date:   10/6/97
Desc:   Installed new version of MOPS navigation routine fit3t.f to fix a bug
        introduced in the 10/3/97 installation.

Date:   10/6/97
Desc:   Installed new hdf_io2.c routine for anly8d that correctly updates the
        solar-zenith angle in the level-2 QC file.

Date:   10/3/97
Desc:   Modified the CLDICE1 parameter for anly8d to 1.1 from 0.85 to improve
        chlorophyll retrieval through clouds.

Date:   10/3/97
Desc:   Updated MOPS navigation source files runfit3t.f and fit3t.f to improve
        performance for sliced GAC and LAC data.

Date:   9/24/97
Desc:   New version of anly8d installed.  This is a change to make sure that
        the level-2 write routines know the actual # of output records.  Before
        this change, put_l2_open derived the # of lines from the start and end
        time of the level-1 file.  This is not always the case and for 1 HRPT,
        caused the level2 generation program to fail because it thought there
        were fewer lines than there actually were.  The fix will add the # lines
        as an input to put_l2_open and will issue a warning if there is a
        difference in the # of lines, but it will continue and not bomb.

Date:   9/23/97 - 10/3/97
Desc:   Updates to navigation parameters during this period have improved the
        level-0 to level-1A process' performance with respect to deriving valid
        corner coordinates.  Frequent updates to the HRPT version of l1agen were
        made available via anonymous FTP.

Date:   9/20/97
Desc:   HRPT Filtering program implemented prior to level-0 to level-1A processi
ng
        to help filter out excess noise in the level-0 file.

Date:   9/18/97 - 9/23/97
Desc:   Additional changes in navigation and calibration were made that resulted
 in
        global reprocessing of all data received since 9/4/97.

Date:   9/18/97
Desc:   First operational day for SeaWiFS

Date:   9/16/97
Desc:   New version of anly8d installed.  This is a change to use the average
        of the dark restore in computing the radiances.  It gets applied to the
        anly program and the level-1b program.

Date:   9/10/97
Desc:   New version of anly8d installed that repairs the seabam_chlor.c routine
        to not allow chlorophyll.  This also fixes  the CZCS chlorophyll calcula
tion

Date:   9/4/97 - 9/17/97
Desc:   Received additional test data from SeaWiFS.  Many changes in navigation
        and calibration were made during this time.

Date:   9/4/97
Desc:   Received first engineering test image from SeaWiFS

Date:   8/97
Desc:   New version of anly8d received from Cal/Val that includes NDVI (land)
        information in the level-2 QC file.

Date:   8/97
Desc:   Added the ability to assign specific recipes to HRPT stations.

Date:   8/97
Desc:   Level-1 and level-2 mapping program implemented for all production
        recipes.  The output files are in PGM and PPM formats are for internal
        use only.

Date:   8/97
Desc:   NDVI Mapping software implemented to create level-3 standard-map files
        for NDVI from the level-2 QC files.
