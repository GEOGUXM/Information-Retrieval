      What is a Cookie?

      A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser--
      along with a Web page-- when you access a Web site. There are two kinds
      of cookies. A session cookie is a line of text that is stored
      temporarily in your computer's RAM.  Because a session cookie is never
      written to a drive, it is destroyed as soon as you close your browser.
      A persistent cookie is a more permanent line of text that gets saved by
      your browser to a file on your hard drive.  Depending on your browser
      settings, you may receive notification that a given site is requesting
      cookie information, possibly with an expiration date.  Persistent
      cookies have an expiration date in the future.  Session cookies have no
      date associated with them.

      GSA.gov’s Use of Cookies

      If you create a MyGSA account, the site will create a session cookie
      whenever you log into MyGSA.  The cookie will contain only the
      information you explicitly provided when you created your account:  GSA
      login name, GSA password, and email address.  This session cookie is
      destroyed as soon as you close your browser.  GSA.gov does not create
      any persistent cookies.

      For more information on privacy and security, see GSA’s Privacy and
      Security Policy.

      If you have any questions about these policies, contact us.
