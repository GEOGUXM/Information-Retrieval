   This website is continually being developed. The site provides
   information which is most frequently requested from the Office of
   Surface Mining and compiles with the requirements of the new Electronic
   Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996. Over the past few months
   we have made many substantive and format changes to the pages in direct
   response from user feedback. The pages you are using now are the result
   of this ongoing development and we hope users will continue to provide
   feedback to make the pages more useful. Our goal is to use this web
   site as a principal mode of communication with the public, with the
   flow of information going in both directions. If you don't find the
   information you need, you need other formats, or if you like what's
   presented, please let us know.

   This site is optimized for use with Internet Explorer 5 and Netscape 4.
   For example, we now use java script for various functions and some
   'button' activated Java Script features will not work when using an
   older browser. This is a very dynamic technical climate, so if you
   experience browser problems, or know of solutions that would make
   improvements to these pages, send us message.
