        Independent Air Quality Monitoring at Los Alamos by the NMED

     The mission of the New Mexico Environment Departments DOE Oversight
     Bureau is to help assure that activities at the U.S. Department of
     Energy facilities in New Mexico are protective of public health and
   safety and the environment. To meet this objective, the Bureau operates
     a network of air quality monitoring stations, co-located with LANL
   monitoring locations. The Bureau compares their data with LANL data to
                determine if the LANL results are verifiable.

     Beginning in 1995, the DOE Oversight Bureau and Los Alamos operated
        co-located sampling stations for ambient air measurements and
   environmental direct pentrating radiation measurements. The Bureau has
       published a series of annual reports describing their programs:
     * 1997 Annual Performance Report
     * 1996 Annual Performance Report
     * 1995 Annual Performance Report

                               [arrowtop.gif]

      Currently, the Bureau has 6 co-located air sampling stations for
      radionuclide monitoring and 12 co-located thermoluminescent (TLD)
           dosimeters for direct penetrating radiation monitoring:

   During 1995, the air sampling techniques used by the Bureau and by LANL
   were very different and hence the results were not comparable. Changes
     in the Bureaus air sampling protocols were made for 1996, so that a
   direct comparison of the 1996 and 1997 co-located air sampling data has
     been conducted. These may be viewed at NMED/LANL Comparison. During
       1996, the Bureau did not subtract a filter blank from their air
      concentration data; the Bureau uses glass fiber filters having a
   greater natural uranium content that LANLs polypropylene filters. Thus
    the Bureaus 1996 uranium data are higher than LANLs data, as would be
   expected. In 1997, the Bureau added tritium (H-3) at four of their five
   air monitoring stations (see table above). These data will be compared
          to LANL when the Bureau makes them publically available.

     At this time, we have not done a direct comparison of TLD data. The
     specific TLD used by the Bureau is sufficiently different than the
    Laboratorys, and results in the Bureaus data being less than the LANL
                            data at all stations.

     There are several national "standards" with which to compare these
      data. EPA and/or DOE have air concentrations guidelines that LANL
    meets. The following tables include these for your use in evaluating
                       the NMED/LANL comparative data:
