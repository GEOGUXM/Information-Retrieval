   Welcome to the Web site of the Permanent Public Access Working Group.

   For nearly 140 years, the
   U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) has produced, distributed and
   disseminated Federal Government information products. One mission of
   GPO in the Information Age is to provide current and future Permanent
   Public Access (PPA) to electronic Federal Government information
   products of public interest or educational value through the Federal
   Depository Library Program (FDLP) and on GPO Access, the agency's Web
   site.

   Ensuring the permanent availability of electronic Government
   information products on GPO servers as well as that which GPO
   identifies, describes, and links to but which remain under the control
   of the originating agencies is a critical concern to GPO and the FDLP.
   The short-and long-term technical and resource implications of ensuring
   permanent access are as yet insufficiently defined. GPO wants to
   coordinate with other FDLP and public information stakeholders to
   develop plans and agreements for keeping this part of the collection
   permanently accessible.

   In September 1999, the Public Printer began a series of meetings with
   representatives of the national libraries, other Federal agencies with
   major information and dissemination programs and other public
   information-related organizations to discuss measures to advance the
   goal of keeping Federal Government information products available to
   the public permanently.

   In early 2001, a report reviewing the activities of the working group
   and highlighting some of the issues discussed at the meetings, was
   produced by GPO staff.
