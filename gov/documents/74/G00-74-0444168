              Solar System Simulator
              History of the Simulator - how this all got started.
[swstrip.gif] [space1.jpg] The Solar System Simulator originated as
              JPL's SPACE software package, which consisted of a set of computer
   graphics programs designed to simulate spacecraft trajectories and
   produce various photographic and video products. The SPACE package was
   specifically designed for animating space missions and was uniquely
   suited to JPL mission design.

   For the Voyager encounters, SPACE provide realistic encounter
   visualizations, graphical bases for the analyses of high-level problems
   and visual aids to trajectory design. The Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
   Neptune flyby movies which SPACE developed were greeted with great
   excitement, shown on NOVA programs and major TV networks, and fostered
   much enthusiasm for the space program around the world.

   To create a mission simulation, SPACE used a spacecraft model,
   scientific instrument characteristics, and a conic elements file that
   described spacecraft and celestial body states. Planetary texture maps,
   observer orientation routines and orbit propagation capabilities were
   included in the SPACE software set. The simulation occured on the host
   computer and is presented to the user in a mode called wireframe,
   wherein only black-and-white outlines of objects are displayed.
   Commands and viewpoint geometry data were shown on a second reference
   monitor in an easy-to-understand graphical user interface. Wireframe
   movies could be shown in real time at rates of up to 15 frames per
   second and were typically used for movie construction and debugging.

   [space2.jpg] Any wireframe or frames could then be color rendered in
   ray-shaded form and stored as files or displayed on a separate monitor.
   Typical scenes could be color rendered in 20 seconds, depending on
   scene content. Movies were created by generating a series of key
   frames; SPACE propagated from one key frame to the next autonomously,
   making movie generation relatively simple. Color rendering used
   dithering, simple antialiasing, careful color space encoding and a high
   order depth priority algorithm.

   Initially developed in the late 1970's and 80's by highly acclaimed
   computer graphics expert Jim Blinn, SPACE continued to serve as an
   outstanding mission design tool for many years. In April through June
   of 1997, David Seal rebuilt the SPACE software set in ANSI C,
   standardized its interface, input and output file formats, added some
   new features, and installed it on the World Wide Web. The new software
   now drives the web-based Solar System Simulator, which can create a
   color image of any planet or satellite as seen from any point in the
   Solar System. The Simulator is currently being used in JPL's Mission
   Architecture section. The software is also being employed by the
   Shuttle Radar Topography, Cassini, Galileo, and other missions for
   trajectory animation and mission visualization. Feedback on the
   simulator is welcome via the feedback form.
