   Falling down
   I've fallen dozens of times over the years. When you fall down a lot,
   you learn early to have "controlled" falls. These are kind of like
   falls movie stuntmen take. You fall down but you don't hurt yourself in
   the process.

   My dossier
   I have spent most of my life working for newspapers. I delivered them
   as a kid in Everett and when I went to work, I was a newspaper reporter
   and sometimes an editor. I wrapped up my newspaper career earlier this
   year as a columnist for The Seattle Times.

   This Week's Column

   Friday, Jan. 25, 2002

   Yo Gee-Man: I live in the unincorporated area of King County, just
   north of Seattle city limits. I want to know where to dump some of my
   household hazardous materials. I can't seem to find the address
   anywhere. Could you please let me know?

   Answer: What you are looking for is the King County Wastemobile. This
   is a traveling hazardous waste collection that goes all over King
   County and picks up the stuff you can't throw into the garbage can.

   You can bring most items you have been keeping in the house and garage.
   Things like pesticides, oil-based and latex paints, thinners, glues,
   fluorescent lights and automobile batteries.

   You can't drop off household batteries (there is a special pickup for
   them), medical waste, explosives or apartment or business maintenance
   waste. Call the Hazards Line at 206-296-4692 to find out where to get
   rid of this stuff. (To leave a message for call back, call 206-205-5978
   or talk with a Solid Waste Division representative at 206-296-6542.)

   To answer this reader's question, the Wastemobile will be at the Aurora
   Square Sears, 15711 Aurora Ave. North, on Jan. 25 through Jan. 27. You
   can get more information by calling 206-263-3051 (or 206-263-3413 for
   TDD) or on the Web site at www.metrokc.gov/hazwaste/wastemobile.

   As long as we are on county services, here are some more questions we
   received:

   Yo Gee-Man: I remodeled my house and I have several doors and windows
   that are still in good shape. What can I do with them?

   Answer: Don't throw them away. What is one person's junk is another
   person's treasure.

   We recommend looking at two places to get and give stuff instead of
   throwing it away. These places are also good to find all sorts of
   things from building material to the kitchen sink.

   One is called Reusable Building Materials Exchange and it is run by
   King County Department of Natural Resources. It's a Web site where you
   can offer all kinds of material (like your doors and windows) or look
   for things like carpeting and bathroom fixtures.

   For a home remodeler, this is a great site to check for the things you
   need for a project. You need to register at the site to post items you
   want to get rid of. The actual exchanges are carried out directly
   between the people. The county doesn't get involved in the exchanges.

   To call up the Web site, go to www.dnr.metrokc.gov/swd/rbme/. This will
   get you to the King County Solid Waste page where you can find that
   information.

   You will also find several other places to give and get stuff. I always
   like to look through the Industrial Materials Exchange Web site where
   you will find things like barrels of cleaner to byproducts from
   manufacturing companies.

   Check out that site at www.metrokc.gov/hazwaste/imex/. You can find
   everything from large plastic bags once used to store potato chips to
   55-gallon barrels to truck tires to chemicals. A lot of this is free
   for the taking or for a very small charge.

   Yo Gee-Man: Why have traffic lights on Northeast 124th Street and the
   West Snoqualmie Valley Road been hung, yet are not on? Is King County
   just waiting until summer when they close down the Woodinville-Duvall
   Road?

   Answer: By the time you read this answer that signal will be up and
   running, says Mark C. Mitchell, Traffic Operation Supervisor for the
   county.

   When you put in traffic signals, some of the steps are completed before
   the other stuff is done. In this case, Mitchell said, the pole and
   signals were hung before the underground wiring was done.

   "In this particular case, the poles and signal heads were installed
   prior to the weather dependent tasks," Mitchell said, "so it looked
   like the signal was completed. But actually, a few essential tasks
   still needed to be finished before we could activate the signal."

   The switch was flipped on Jan. 17, so the light is now operating.

   Yo Gee-Man: Can you tell me who to contact in King County to pick up
   trash someone has dumped along 140th Street Southeast in North Bend?
   There is an old exhaust pipe, pieces of plywood and a wide screen
   television set. I have looked in the phone book under King County
   Government but cannot find who is responsible.

   Answer: Call the King County Maintenance Section at the toll free
   number 1-800-527-6237 (1-800-K C ROADS). This number is answered
   24-hours a day.

   Be sure to give the exact address where the trash is located because
   King County is responsible for Southeast 140th Street but not for 140th
   Street Southeast. That part of the road could be inside North Bend city
   limits and the city would clean it up.

   Another citizen asked who to call about a plugged culvert under a
   county road. It's the same 1-800 number as above. But remember that
   this number is for people living in the unincorporated areas of King
   County. If you live in a city, call your local street department.
