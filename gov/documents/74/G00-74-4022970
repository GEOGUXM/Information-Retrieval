   The Legislature directed the Institute to evaluate the costs and
   benefits of certain juvenile and adult criminal justice policies and
   violence prevention programs. Policymakers asked the Institute to
   determine whether interventions such as treatment and intensive
   supervision are cost-effective in reducing subsequent criminal
   offending. The Institute has developed a cost-benefit model that can be
   used in conjunction with outcome evaluations to test
   cost-effectiveness. The programs being evaluated include the prison sex
   offender treatment program for adults and several juvenile offender
   programs run by the juvenile courts.
