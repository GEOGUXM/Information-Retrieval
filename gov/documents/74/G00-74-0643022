   New Way to Make "Neuts"

   Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National
   Laboratory's Accelerator and Fusion Research Division (AFRD) have developed
   neutron generators small enough to descend into a borehole, provide neutrons
   for brain-cancer therapy, and peer inside airport luggage.

      November 26, 2001Neutrons can penetrate deeply to find defects in
      large machine parts or tiny microdevices, elucidate the structure of
      biological systems and polymers, sense fluids in geological formations,
      and probe solids and liquids on the atomic scale.

      Ka-Ngo Leung and his colleagues in Berkeley Lab's Accelerator and
      Fusion Research Division (AFRD) have devised a series of neutron
      generators small enough to descend into a borehole, provide neutrons
      for brain-cancer therapy, peer inside airport luggage, or perch on a
      laboratory bench.

      Leung is head of the Plasma and Ion Source Technology Group in AFRD's
      Ion Beam Technology Program. In many ways the performance of the
      group's compact generator matches the largest neutron sources now in
      useat a fraction of the cost. For this reason, says William Barletta,
      AFRD division director, "neutron tubes offer a means of providing a new
      generation of instruments on university campuses to provide a growing,
      vigorous user base for national user facilities."
