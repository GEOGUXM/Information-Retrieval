                   Directions to JPL's Table Mountain Facility

                             Telephone: 760-249-3650
                                Fax: 760-249-5392

     Ontario Airport is the closest to TMF and is approximately a 45-minute
     drive. From LAX the driving time is about 2 hours. On the approach to
     TMF all but the last 15 miles is on major freeways.

     From any airport, or other location, in the Los Angeles basin first
     make your way to the 10 Freeway and proceed east in the direction of
     San Bernardino. At the junction with the 15 turn north towards Las
     Vegas and Barstow (see map) and follow this to the turnoff onto Highway
     138. Turn left (west) onto Highway 138 sign-posted to Palmdale and
     Wrightwood.

     Continue to the junction with the Angeles Crest Highway, Highway 2,
     which you should follow through the town of Wrightwood to the junction
     at Big Pines Ranger Station. There is a large stone tower at the ranger
     station, which provides a landmark. Take the first right turn onto
     Table Mountain Road (sign-posted to Ski Sunrise) and follow this road
     to the ski area. Proceed across the ski area parking lot and stay to
     the right of the ski lodge where you will find a narrow road and a "Do
     Not Enter" sign and barracade. Continue up this road which brings you
     to the front gates of the Table Mountain Facility.

     The gates are closed at all times for security reasons. There is a
     phone at the fence, please call the facility operations number (which
     is posted, 3650), during regular work hours. Facility personnel will
     answer, introduce yourself and state your business at the facility.
     After hours you may get a recording, leave the same information and
     wait until the off hours personnel can respond to your request.
     (Usually only a few minutes)

     The facility personnel will remotely open the gate for you, drive to
     the first building, park and go in to register at the desk. You must
     have picture identification on you to be permitted on site. If you are
     a JPL employee you will be required to wear your JPL badge at all
     times, if you are a visitor, you will be issued a visitor's badge which
     also must be worn at all times, no exceptions. Please do not hesitate
     to contact us if further information or help of any kind is needed.
