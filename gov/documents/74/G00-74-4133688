      OAKLAND, Calif., Nov. 26, 2001. . . The Bay Area owes a big thank-you
      to state Assemblyman John Dutra (D-Fremont). During the course of 2001,
      the Fremont legislator and chair of the Assembly Transportation
      Committee sponsored Assembly Constitutional Amendment 4 (ACA 4), which
      would put state and local transportation funding on a much firmer
      footing, and another bill that will ensure that funding is sufficient
      to retrofit all of California's state-owned toll bridges, including the
      replacement of the Bay Bridge's eastern span.

      "In his first year as Chair of the Assembly Transportation Committee
      Chairman Dutra has authored and steered to passage two very important
      bills for the Bay Area and California," said MTC Chair Sharon Brown.
      "On behalf of the Bay Area, MTC will thank Assemblymember Dutra for
      these accomplishments by presenting him the 2001 John F. Foran
      Legislative Award." The presentation will take place this Wednesday,
      Nov. 28, at 10 a.m. in the Lawrence Dahms Auditorium at the Joseph P.
      Bort MetroCenter, 101 Eighth Street in Oakland.

      ACA 4 places Proposition 42 on the March 2002 ballot. If passed,
      Proposition 42 would perpetually dedicate the state sales tax on
      gasoline to transportation purposes without a tax increase. The
      existing sales tax was first dedicated for transportation purposes in
      2000 when the $6.8 billion Traffic Congestion Relief Program was
      passed, but both the fund transfer and the program are set to expire in
      2008. Proposition 42 would add $5.8 billion to Bay Area transportation
      projects and $29.3 billion statewide over the next 25 years --
      critically needed new revenue that would help this region and all of
      California address major transportation requirements, which are
      expected to increase as the population continues to grow. The new funds
      would be split 20 percent to cities and 20 percent to counties for
      local street and road maintenance, 40 percent for the State
      Transportation Improvement Program or STIP (the STIP is the statewide
      vehicle for funding major transportation projects), and 20 percent for
      other specifically identified transit operations and capital projects.
      Proposition 42 requires a simple majority vote for passage and would be
      the first new funding source for transportation in over a decade; this
      would be achieved without a tax increase of any kind.

      Dutra also authored Assembly Bill 1171, which provides $2.5 billion in
      additional funding needed to construct a seismically sound eastern span
      for the Bay Bridge and to retrofit other state-owned toll bridges
      throughout the Bay Area, Los Angeles and San Diego. "This hard-fought
      measure will ensure that commuters are safe when they cross these busy
      bridges, and that the Bay Area's economy is protected when the next big
      temblor arrives," said MTC Vice Chair Steve Kinsey.

      Dutra was successful in achieving passage of both bills. AB 1171 passed
      in the Senate by 23-13 and in the Assembly by 46-27. ACA 4 swept the
      Senate 36-1 and the Assembly 68-2.

      Assemblyman Dutra has served on the Assembly Transportation Committee
      since 1999, taking over as chair in the fall of 2000. Dutra has been an
      assemblymember since 1998. Before that he served on the Fremont City
      Council and the Fremont Planning Commission.

      The John F. Foran Legislative Award has been given out annually since
      1986 to a legislator who has worked hard to advance the Bay Area's
      transportation needs. It is named in honor of former state Sen. John F.
      Foran, the long-term chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee
      and author of the bill that created MTC.

      MTC is the transportation planning, coordinating and financing agency
      for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area.
