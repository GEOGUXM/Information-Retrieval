   CCEVS Education and Training Courses
   __________________________________________________

   Project Description: In order to promote quality and consistency in
   evaluations conducted by NIAP Common Criteria Testing Laboratories
   (CCTL) and in validations conducted by the NIAP Common Criteria
   Evaluation and Validation Scheme (CCEVS), a curriculum of training
   courses is needed. These training courses can be offered to the general
   public and to the members of the CCEVS community (including sponsors of
   evaluations, evaluators and validators). The training courses will be
   focused on the international security standard Common Criteria (CC),
   the Common Evaluation Methodology (CEM), and CCEVS policies and
   procedures.

   Project Objectives: Develop a series of technical training courses for
   validators, evaluators and sponsors of evaluations that would promote
   greater understanding of the CCEVS requirements and the specific
   requirements of the CC and CEM. The training courses would:
     * Ensure quality evaluations and validations of commercial products;
     * Establish a common understanding among evaluation facilities;
     * Increase competency within the evaluation and validation
       communities; and
     * Promote consistency across evaluations and validations.
