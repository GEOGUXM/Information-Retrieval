                             Loki - Performance

   For a comparison with other parallel supercomputers, the following is a
   table of the performance of our parallel treecode running a 10 million
   particle benchmark. All machines are running the same code, with the
   exception that the Intel i860 machines and the CM-5 have the inner loop
   coded in assembly language. The code for Loki is entirely in C, and was
   compiled with gcc 2.7.2. Message passing was accomplished with our own
   UDP socket library.

   Time is wall clock time in seconds, and includes all message passing
   and load imbalance overheads.
