   Just as they do on the farm, conservation practices on nonagricultural
   land can help increase food and shelter for birds and other wildlife,
   control soil erosion, reduce sediment in waterways, conserve water and
   improve water quality, inspire a stewardship ethic, and beautify the
   landscape.

   Backyard Conservation shows you how conservation practices that are
   used on agricultural land across the country to conserve and improve
   natural resources can be adapted for use on the land around your home.
   These practices help the environment and can make your yard more
   attractive and enjoyable.

   Whether you have acres in the country, an average-sized suburban yard,
   or a tiny plot in the city, you can help protect the environment and
   add beauty and interest to your surroundings. Ten conservation
   practices have been scaled down for homeowners and city residents to
   use in their yards. Tip sheets offer "how to" steps and helpful hints
   on the following practices:
