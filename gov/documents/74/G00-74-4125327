   Research Interests:

   We have developed fish models - backcross hybrids of Xiphophorus
   strains - that are exquisitely sensitive to light-induced melanoma and
   alkylating-agent-induced retinoblastoma, presumably because the hybrids
   have only one tumor suppressor gene for melanoma or retinoblastoma.
   Physical or chemical agents may inactivate the genes by single hits and
   so result in tumor cell proliferation. These fish are the only useful
   animal models for human melanoma and retinoblastoma.

   We work on the macroscopic effects of tumor induction - doses and
   wavelengths of light - and on the microscopic aspects - photoproduct
   induction and DNA sequence changes in tumor cells. The photobiological
   data indicate that all wavelengths tested from 302-540 nm are effective
   in melanoma induction, and that, even though the UVB range (290-320 nm)
   is most effective, the product of the effectiveness multiplied by
   sunlight intensity for wavelengths > 320 nm is 10 to 20-fold higher
   than for wavelengths < 320 nm.

   After 12 years as Associate Director and two years as acting Associate
   Director for Life Sciences as well as seven years as Chairman of the
   Biology Department, Dick Setlow returned to active research. See the
   story in the Brookhaven Bulletin Vol.52 No.30 of July 31, 1998.
