                   ATMOSPHERIC BOUNDARY LAYER EXPERIMENTS

                               [titlebar.gif]

Introduction

   The Atmospheric Boundary Layer Experiments (ABLE) is a research
   initiative devoted to atmospheric research. This project has been
   developed by the Atmospheric Section of Argonne National Laboratory.
   The ABLE is located on the lower Walnut Watershed, mostly in Butler
   County east of the city of Wichita, Kansas. This location is within the
   existing boundaries of DOE's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM)
   Southern Great Plains (SGP) Clouds and Radiation Testbed (CART) site.
   The establishment of this facility offers a virtual atmospheric
   observatory and provides essential research tools for addressing a
   myriad of unresolved fundamental questions in atmospheric research. The
   ABLE provides a continuous view of processes in the lower atmosphere
   over a limited domain within the SGP CART site.

   The initial focus of the ABLE is measurements of the planetary boundary
   layer (PBL) where almost all interactions between the atmosphere and
   humans take place. Many scientific issues may be addressed by use of
   such a facility, including;
     * Natural disaster reduction and public safety
     * Safe and efficient aviation and other transportation
     * Agriculture
     * Water resource management
     * Effective energy production, use and environmental protection
     * Space flight operations
     * Defense
     * Related areas of Earth Science
