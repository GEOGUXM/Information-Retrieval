Alternative Dispute Resolution

The OSC Mediation Program

   The OSC offers Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to resolve selected
   prohibited personnel practice complaints. ADR, used in appropriate
   circumstances, can yield results that are faster, less expensive, and
   less contentious than traditional OSC complaint processing. The OSC
   primarily uses mediation to provide parties the opportunity to resolve
   an OSC complaint without the need for a lengthy investigation or costly
   litigation.

What is Mediation?

   Mediation is an informal process in which a neutral third party - the
   mediator - assists the opposing parties in reaching a voluntary,
   negotiated resolution of the complaint.  Mediation is different from
   other forms of dispute resolution in that the parties participate
   voluntarily, and the mediator has no authority to make a decision.  The
   decision-making power rests in the hands of the parties.

                                                                [Top of Page]

How Does Mediation Work?

   Mediation gives the parties the opportunity to discuss the issues
   raised in the complaint, clear up misunderstandings, find areas of
   agreement and, ultimately, to incorporate those areas of agreement into
   a final resolution of the complaint.  The mediator focuses the
   attention of the parties upon their needs and interests rather than on
   their stated positions.

   Participation in the OSC Mediation Program is voluntary. In selected
   cases that are slated for referral to OSCs Investigation and
   Prosecution Division, the OSC ADR Specialist contacts the complainant
   and the employing agency to invite them to participate in the mediation
   program.  If both parties agree, OSC schedules a Mediation Session.
   OSC mediators, who have extensive mediation training and experience in
   federal personnel law, conduct a mediation session at a mutually
   convenient time and location. If mediation results in resolution, the
   agreement is put into writing and becomes binding on both parties.

                                                                [Top of Page]

Advantages of Mediation

   Many parties prefer mediation as a dispute resolution process because
   it is:
     * INFORMAL. The process is informal and flexible; attorneys are not
       necessary. There are no formal rules of evidence and no witnesses.

     * CONFIDENTIAL. Mediation is a confidential process. The mediators
       will not disclose any information revealed during the mediation.
       The sessions are not tape-recorded or transcribed. At the
       conclusion of the mediation, mediators destroy any notes they took
       during the mediation session.

     * QUICK AND INEXPENSIVE. When parties want to get on with their
       business and their lives, mediation may be desirable as a means of
       producing rapid results. The majority of mediations are completed
       in one or two sessions.

   Moreover, mediation generally produces or promotes:
     * GREATER DEGREE OF PARTY CONTROL. Parties who negotiate their own
       settlements have more control over the outcome of their dispute.
       Parties have an equal say in the process. There is no determination
       of fault, but rather, the parties reach a mutually agreeable
       resolution to their conflict.

     * PRESERVATION OF RELATIONSHIPS. Many disputes occur in the context
       of ongoing work relationships. Mediated settlements that address
       all parties interests often preserve working relationships in ways
       that would not be possible in a win/lose decision-making procedure.
       Mediation can also make the termination of a work relationship more
       amicable.

     * MUTUALLY SATISFACTORY RESULTS. Parties are generally more satisfied
       with solutions that have been mutually agreed upon, as opposed to
       solutions that are imposed by a third party decision-maker.

     * COMPREHENSIVE AND CUSTOMIZED AGREEMENTS. Mediated agreements often
       help resolve procedural and interpersonal issues that are not
       necessarily susceptible to legal determination. The parties can
       tailor their settlement to their particular situation and attend to
       the fine details of implementation.

     * A FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE PROBLEM-SOLVING. After a mediation
       resolution, if a subsequent dispute occurs, parties are more likely
       to utilize a cooperative forum of problem-solving to resolve their
       differences than to pursue an adversarial approach.

Answers to Frequently Asked Questions

   Question: Does mediation work?
   Answer: While each case is unique, general statistics from a wide range
   of forums indicate that mediation resolves over 70% of disputes.

   Question: Does OSC require the parties to participate in mediation?
   Answer: No. Participation is strictly voluntary.

   Question: What happens if one party declines OSC's invitation to
   mediate, or decides to terminate mediation before resolution of the
   complaint?
   Answer: In either case, the complaint will be assigned to the
   Investigation and Prosecution Division, as it would have been had
   mediation not been offered to the parties.

   Question: Who mediates OSC complaints?
   Answer: OSC cases are conducted by mediators who are experienced and
   trained in mediation and federal personnel law. OSC maintains a roster
   of trained mediators on staff. All internal OSC mediators are neutral
   unbiased professionals with no stake in the outcome of the mediation
   process.

   Question: Who attends the mediation session?
   Answer: The complainant and a representative from the employing agency
   attend the mediation. While it is not necessary to have an attorney or
   other representative attend the session, either party may choose to do
   so. It is essential, however, that the individuals attending the
   mediation session have the authority necessary to resolve the dispute.

   Question: How long does the mediation process take?
   Answer: The length of the mediation session depends upon the complexity
   of the case and willingness of the parties to resolve the dispute. Most
   mediations are completed in eight hours or less. More complex cases may
   call for a second mediation session.

   Question: What happens if the mediation does not result in resolution?
   Answer: The parties risk nothing by participating in mediation. If
   resolution is not achieved, the complaint is assigned to the
   Investigation and Prosecution Division, as it would have been had the
   parties not tried mediation.

   Question: Are all OSC complaints eligible for mediation?
   Answer: No. The OSC ADR Unit evaluates each complaint that has been
   slated for referral to OSC's Investigation and Prosecution Division to
   determine whether it is appropriate for mediation. The factors
   considered include the nature of the case, the relationship of the
   parties, the complexity of the case, and the relief sought by the
   complainant. Allegations that do not warrant referral to the
   Investigation and Prosecution Division are not eligible for mediation.

   Question: Can a complaint that is already in the Investigation and
   Prosecution Division be mediated?
   Answer: Mediation may be available as an option at the investigation
   and prosecution stages at the discretion of OSC.
