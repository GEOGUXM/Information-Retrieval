   Charlotte/Douglas Airport Improvements



   ASDE   Airport Surface Detection Equipment,

   ASDE penetrates rain, snow, fog, and darkness to show FAA air traffic
   controllers in the airport tower a picture of all airplanes and vehicle
   traffic moving on ramps, taxiways, and runways. The system brings
   together three state-of-the-art technologies_radar, mechanical
   engineering, and computer engineering_into one safety-enhancing device.
   The radar produces a clear and accurate display even during the
   severest weather conditions. The display system superimposes an
   enhanced radar picture on top of a map of the airport so that the
   controller can see the position of the target radar image and a
   geographical position on the airport surface. A new radar image is
   produced each second.

   The Airport Surface Detection Equipment greatly enhances the ability of
   tower personnel to provide for a safer environment in the movement of
   aircraft and ground vehicles otherwise not observed.

   The ASDE at Charlotte Tower is operational.
