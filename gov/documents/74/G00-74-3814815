   The Las Vegas applicant coordinator is Special Agent Georgia Lynch
   Kinkella.  She and Staffing Assistant Linda Pinkney are responsible for
   recruiting, testing, and processing applicants interested in employment

       (* = critical needs)

   Applicants interested in the above positions may request an application
                           by e-mail or by calling
                               (702) 383-3555

   Applicants who are interested in working for the FBI in any other
   non-agent positions, and are willing to relocate, should send an
   updated and detailed resume to Applicant Coordinator, FBI, 700 East
   Charleston Boulevard, Las Vegas, Nevada  89104.

   Resumes received in Las Vegas will be forwarded to FBI Headquarters for
   review.  Applicants possessing skills and experience necessary for
   those positions will be contacted and requested to fill out an
   application at a later time.  Most of these positions will be located
   in the Washington, D.C., area.

   Also, each summer the Honor Internship Program (HIP) at FBI
   Headquarters selects a limited number of outstanding undergraduates and
   graduate students for an insider's view of FBI operations and an
   opportunity to explore the career opportunities with the Bureau.
