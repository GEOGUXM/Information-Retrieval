   Software Independent Assessments
     Jump to the Assessments List

   The IV&V Facility provides independent technical assessments of NASA
   systems and software processes and products to identify development and
   operational risks. This effort helps to provide assurance that safe and
   reliable software is being provided to NASA Strategic Enterprises as
   they work toward successful systems and software development.
   Three types of assessments are possible, depending on the level of
   assessment deemed necessary by the NASA IV&V Facility Independent
   Assessment Team (IAT) and the customer.

     A Systems Assessment is called for when short-term involvement is
     requested during any phase of the life-cycle development process.
     The IAT performs a systems assessment to evaluate basic
     requirements, design, testing, and processes of systems under
     development. The IAT also identifies risks associated with the
     safety and criticality of the mission and makes recommendations for
     corrective action.

     A Life-Cycle Assessment is appropriate if the customer requests
     long-term involvement. A life-cycle development assessment
     identifies risks associated with mission success during any software
     development life-cycle phase and makes recommendations for
     corrective action. In this case, the IAT also performs a mission
     readiness assessment of updated systems software changes and
     anomalies per mission as requested by the customer.

     A Startup Assessment is usually recommended when the customer
     requests that the appropriate level of IV&V be assessed. A Startup
     Assessment is performed to identify the software components that are
     more safety critical with higher development risks considering
     complexity, size and new technology. The IAT then makes a
     recommendation for IV&V.

   These types of assessments can address any aspect of software
   engineering and can be applied anywhere within the systems and software
   development life cycle phases. This capability provides for multiple
   spot-checking throughout the systems and software development life
   cycle and addresses those issues that can jeopardize mission safety and
   quality.
