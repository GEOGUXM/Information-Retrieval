             Welcome to the On-Line Discussion Forum for Toolkit


   We have developed this site to allow anyone within the state, to post
   questions and concerns regarding Toolkit. We want to provide everyone
   in the field the opportunity to voice their opinions or ask their
   questions. How was your training? What new and creative things have you
   done with the product? What questions do you have on how to perform a
   certain function? We know that people have questions on how to use
   Toolkit and we also know that we have experienced users in the field
   that could help others via this discussion group. Please post your
   questions and check back frequently to see the answers that will be
   posted. This is a public forum, so what you post will be seen by all
   who access the site. For example if you have a problem creating a
   document, you can post it here and maybe someone who has already solved
   this problem could give you a reply. If you have a training need post
   it on this forum. We at the state office will use this forum to post
   solutions to problems that may be common to everyone within the state,
   and we will also attempt to answer any questions that you have.
