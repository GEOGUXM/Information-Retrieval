      The California Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act, Government Code
      Chapter 12, Section 8871, et seq., authored by Senators Alquist and
      Campbell, was signed into law by Governor Deukmejian on October 2,
   1985. The statute requires the Seismic Safety Commission to prepare and
   administer a program setting forth priorities, funding sources,
   amounts, schedules, and other resources needed to reduce statewide
   earthquake hazards significantly by the year 2001. Until 1997, the
   California Seismic Safety Commission had presented the program required
   by the California Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act in a series of
   five-year Plans, titled California at Risk. In November 1997, the
   Commission released the latest version of the Plan with new format and
   updated information. Titled The California Earthquake Loss Reduction
   Plan, it incorporates lessons learned from the Loma Prieta, CA (1989),
   Northridge, CA (1994), and Kobe, Japan (1995) earthquakes. This version
   of the Plan fulfills several needs: 1) it continues to be the
   Commission's policy statement about what needs to be done to reduce
   earthquake risk over the long term; 2) it serves as the state's
   strategic Plan, guiding the executive and legislative branches in
   overall implementation strategies and priorities for seismic safety;
   and 3) it complies with the Federal Emergency Management Agency's
   National Hazards Mitigation Strategy and is the state's hazard
   mitigation Plan required for federal mitigation funding after
   earthquakes. The Plan emphasizes the importance of upgrading existing
   vulnerable structures, better design of new construction, and increased
   preparedness in all areas as the most cost-effective methods of
   reducing loss and improving recovery from earthquakes.

   Each element has four strategies with related initiatives identifying
   actions to be accomplished by the private sector, state, and local
   governments. This Plan presents a strategic program that will help all
   Californians become better prepared for earthquakes.To order a copy of
