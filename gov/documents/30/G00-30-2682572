                       Statement of Dr. Mark Schaefer,
              Deputy Assistant Secretary for Water and Science
                       U.S. Department of the Interior
                                 before the
                        U.S. House of Representatives
                           Committee on Resources
                       Subcommittee on Water and Power
                              October 30, 1997

   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to address
   the Department's involvement in evaluating current El Niño forecasts
   and our plans for operating dams and other facilities in the western
   United States during the predicted strong weather events. I will also
   discuss the Department's participation in forecasting research and its
   monitoring functions associated with an El Niño event.

   Background

   The shifts in typical patterns of ocean and atmospheric circulation in
   the tropical Pacific region brought about by El Niño will also affect
   atmospheric pressure, storm tracks, precipitation, and temperature
   patterns across the northern Pacific and the North American continent.
   Of particular concern to the Department are changes in precipitation,
   temperature, and streamflow because of our responsibilities for
   managing land and water resources.

   Previous El Niño events have resulted in an increase in the number and
   severity of winter storms along the California coast and wetter than
   normal winter weather in the Southwest. In contrast, Hawaii, the
   Pacific Northwest, the northern Rockies, and the upper Great Plains
   have experienced warmer and drier winters. These changes may occur as
   early as October but typically are strongest in winter and early
   spring.

   The National Weather Service (NWS) and other agencies are tracking the
   present El Niño event. Their observations to date indicate that the
   present El Niño is the strongest episode of the past 50 years. NWS
   experts expect this El Niño to produce wetter than normal conditions
   over most of the extreme southern United States this winter.

   Across the nation, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is monitoring
   streamflow at nearly 7,000 locations, about half of which transmit
   information in real time. This network will provide the first
   indications of the effects of El Niño on rivers and reservoirs and
   forms the basis for flood forecasting, warning, and mitigation
   activities throughout the country.

   Department's Involvement in the Evaluation of El Niño Forecasts

   The Department has been extensively involved in evaluating current El
   Niño forecasts. The USGS has provided the historical basis for
   understanding and using current long-range forecasts of El Niño
   consequences for water resources and water hazards in the western
   United States. El Niños are associated with increased precipitation and
   runoff, and in particular with increased frequency of extreme
   hydrologic eventsrainstorms, snowstorms, and floods. Of these three,
   the increase in extreme floods tends to be the most pronounced. Daily
   streamflow data from 50 years of USGS records reveal a marked increase
   in short-term floods during El Niños, even when total seasonal
   streamflow is not profoundly affected. Studies show that previous El
   Niños have caused many of the most severe floods in southern California
   and other southwestern States. The USGS has been active in
   communicating these lessons from its long-term streamflow records to
   water managers in California and the West.

   The predicted strength of this event raises unusual problems because we
   do not know whether the most intense El Niños simply yield more intense
   versions of the regional water resources and hazard effects typically
   associated with El Niños, large and small, or whether they result in
   whole new patterns of effects. For example, during the strong El Niño
   of 1982-83, most of the West Coast experienced substantial increases in
   rainfall. Like the meteorological community, USGS is working to
   determine whether the 1982-83 El Niño is an appropriate analog for the
   coming winter and is reassessing the hydrologic effects of that
   episode.

   The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has been closely tracking
   long-range forecasts with the support of the National Weather Service's
   River Forecast Centers and Climate Prediction Center and its Technical
   Service Center in Denver. Reclamation is developing a procedure to
   integrate these forecasts into Reclamation operations at all sites.
   Water operations managers in the five regional offices and 60 area and
   project offices will be kept informed in real time via the Internet as
   well as through monthly distribution of forecast information. As
   individual storms approach, Reclamation offices will, as always,
   closely monitor short-term forecasts in areas above reservoirs to
   determine the potential for flooding.

   Reclamation has also begun the process of informing water managers of
   the potential impacts of this El Niño, as well as the current state of
   climate prediction capabilities. The bureau has opened a dialogue
   between its water managers and climate researchers from the NWS and
   other agencies. It will continue to inform its water operations staff
   throughout the West about the formulation of forecasts and the level of
   confidence in these forecasts.

   Reclamation is also developing detailed hydrographs of previous El Niño
   events at key river gauges to provide water managers with specific
   comparisons for their water management models. To improve water
   management models and to link mountain precipitation from winter storms
   to water management efforts, Reclamation is partnering with USGS,
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National
   Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center, and the Operational
   Support Facility of the Next Generation Radar System (NEXRAD), the
   National Weather Service's Doppler Radar System, which gauges rainfall
   intensity over large geographic areas. The partners are intensifying
   efforts to improve current methods for analyzing and predicting snow
   water content, to improve streamflow forecasts, and to provide that
   information in real time to Reclamation water managers.

   Regarding long-range forecasting and planning, Reclamation has hosted
   or participated in three workshops this year involving weather and
   climate modeling for improved water resource management. These
   workshops have helped define for the climate modeling and forecasting
   community the real-world needs of water managers. They have also helped
   water managers to understand the implications and limitations of
   climate forecasting and to see how forecasting can assist them in
   making better water management decisions. In addition, Reclamation,
   USGS, and NOAA's National Center for Environmental Prediction are
   collaborating on research to improve streamflow forecasts used by water
   resource managers.

   Operation of Facilities and Emergency Response During the Predicted El
   Niño Event

   We are very concerned about the potential impact of this El Niño event
   on Reclamation's 596 dams and reservoirs (attached) and on its water
   management activities if the long-range forecasts prove accurate. Of
   greatest concern is the potential for increased precipitation in
   southern areas and warm, dry weather in northern areas.

   Long-range forecasts are too general for us to target the specific
   watersheds and precise locations that may be affected by storm events
   related to El Niño. However, past events and current information
   suggest that we should prepare for frequent heavy precipitation this
   winter in the mountains of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and other
   areas that affect the operations of Reclamation in the Mid-Pacific,
   Upper and Lower Colorado, and southern Great Plains regions. This
   translates into potentially high water levels in reservoirs of the
   Central Valley Project, the Colorado River Storage Project, Lake
   Powell, Lake Mead, and the Rio Grande Basin Projects, as well as a host
   of smaller projects in these areas. Conversely, northern projects on
   the Columbia, Snake, and Upper Missouri Rivers may experience warm, dry
   conditions resulting in the need to increase their conservation storage
   pools.

   The Central Valley Project (CVP) is Reclamation's largest and most
   complex project, comprising storage and diversion dams, pumping plants,
   canals, and distribution facilities that deliver water throughout
   40,000 square miles. The 1982-83 water year was the wettest of record
   throughout the Central Valley basin. Record precipitation throughout
   the winter led to a very large spring snowmelt runoff that lasted until
   June. Above-average runoff into CVP reservoirs required continuous
   above-average releases. Releases never reached levels that caused
   significant flooding, but many concerns were expressed about the damage
   to agriculture from seepage.

   Reclamation is also preparing for the possibility of increased storm
   events associated with this El Niño. It is tracking weather forecasts,
   incorporating the forecasts into ongoing modeling activities and
   planning possible management actions to respond to storms. Significant
   operational actions to accommodate potential high inflows next spring
   are already underway. Reclamation's water operations and management
   activities in each project area are already in a delicate balance of
   supply and demand. Reclamation will prepare and plan for the likelihood
   of storm events associated with this El Niño in all project areas that
   may be affected. However, day-to-day operations and management
   decisions will continue to be made on a short-term basis. Reclamation
   will change its water management and operations in response to
   short-term weather forecasts that target specific storms.

   Similarly, USGS is using El Niño forecast information, in conjunction
   with historical El Niño-flood discharge relations, to evaluate the
   status and condition of its stream gauging equipment in regions where
   floods are likely. This will help ensure that stream gauges will be
   fully operational during extreme conditions should they develop,
   thereby providing NWS with uninterrupted real-time streamflow data for
   its flood forecasting operations.

   The USGS Coastal and Marine Program in collaboration with NOAA and NASA
   is evaluating the potential land loss in coastal areas from severe
   storms. Three sections of the Pacific coast between Point Grenville,
   Washington, and San Diego, California, totaling roughly 200 miles each,
   are being surveyed by an Airborne Topographic Mapper scanning laser
   survey to determine changes in the coastline over the coming winter
   season. This and related information will be made available on the
   Internet (http://marine.usgs.gov/). The airborne data is being combined
   with ongoing studies of coastal processes to enable USGS to assess and
   understand the erosional impact of the storms along the West Coast.

   USGS geospatial data  topographic maps, digital elevation models, and
   other products  are critical to emergency preparedness and relief
   efforts by Federal, State, and local agencies. Special USGS response
   teams are on call 24 hours a day to ensure that topographic and special
   maps are in the hands of State and Federal emergency coordinators
   within hours. When Hurricane Andrew struck the Florida and Louisiana
   Coasts in 1992, USGS rushed nearly 232,000 maps of the affected areas
   to emergency response officials.

   Department's Participation in Forecasting Research and Monitoring

   The USGS is collaborating with Reclamation, various NOAA operational
   and research groups, and State agencies to test and improve the
   hydrologic value of current weather and climate forecasts. NOAA's
   National Center for Environmental Prediction and Climate Diagnostics
   Center, as well as some local Weather Service offices, will provide
   past and future weather forecasts for use in experimental hydrologic
   models in California, Colorado, and the Northwest. Time scales of the
   forecasts range from days to weeks. Monthly to seasonal-scale climate
   forecasts are being obtained through the International Research
   Institute for Climate Prediction (at the Scripps Institution of
   Oceanography) and the NOAA Climate Prediction Center for use in longer
   term hydrologic-forecasting experiments. Research on the linkages
   between weather and climate predictions and existing hydrologic models
   will improve the usefulness of medium-range weather forecasts to water
   managers.

   The USGS is investigating the predictability of hydrologic conditions
   in the Sierra Nevada mountains, using National Center for Environmental
   Prediction (NCEP) forecasts of temperature and precipitation.
   Preliminary results of this work are encouraging. It is probable that
   7-day temperature and precipitation forecasts issued by NCEP will allow
   USGS to successfully forecast 7-9 days in advance, the timing and
   magnitude of flooding such as that which occurred on the Merced River
   last December. The USGS is continuing these modeling experiments to
   evaluate the limits of medium-range flow forecasting in conjunction
   with El Niño.

   The USGS is also contributing valuable information regarding the
   potential for landslide occurrences associated with El Niño weather
   effects by combining its computerized national landslide susceptibility
   map with national climate outlook maps produced by NOAA (attached).
   NOAA's maps depict the predicted distribution of El Niño-induced
   precipitation and temperature anomalies for 1997-98. This combination
   of USGS and NOAA information will indicate where and when rainfall- and
   snowmelt-induced landsliding may occur this coming winter and spring.
   We will frequently update and refine this information and make it
   available on the Internet (http://geohazards.cr.usgs.gov), and we will
   indicate broad regions of the Nation that have increased potential for
   landslides during the coming El Niño climatic episode.

   In addition to regional hazard assessments, USGS is involved in a
   variety of landslide investigations at a more detailed level including:
    1. production of maps of landslide and debris-flow hazards in the San
       Francisco Bay and Los Angeles areas;
    2. studies of the increased potential for landslides in the aftermath
       of brush and forest fires that may occur as a result of unusually
       dry conditions; and
    3. investigation and monitoring of recent major and potential
       landslide events in the Seattle and Denver areas, in northern New
       Mexico, near Sacramento, California, and in the Central
       Appalachians.

   These detailed studies provide the quantitative basis for assessing
   landslide and debris-flow hazards nationwide and also provide
   site-specific information critical to emergency response agencies
   tasked with managing crises and mitigating hazards.

   The floods and droughts associated with El Niño can seriously affect
   water quality. Increased loads of nutrients and toxic chemicals may be
   washed into rivers during flood conditions. Conversely, during a
   drought, the lower water levels may increase the concentrations of
   harmful substances in the river. The USGS National Water-Quality
   Assessment Program collects water-quality information at selected
   rivers in 50 large river basins in the United States for use by water
   managers at State and local agencies. The primary objective of the
   program is to determine the distribution of chemicals over the long
   term, but water-quality information collected after specific severe
   storms can be provided to water managers on very short notice.

   Like the water-quality assessment program, USGS biological studies are
   not directly targeted at El Niño issues but will be useful in tracking
   changes in various biological communities. For example, in northwest
   Washington, ongoing studies of juvenile Pacific salmon growth patterns
   may detect changes related to El Niño effects. Following the 9-month El
   Niño drought of 1991-92, researchers documented declines in six
   populations of forest birds in Hawaii and the Pacific Territories.
   Additional information regarding El-Nino and other subjects can be
   found on the USGS Internet homepage (http://www.usgs.gov/).

   Future Needs

   These planned actions are expected to meet the needs of water managers
   and mitigate the effects of extreme weather events that may arise from
   this El Niño. However, unanticipated needs may arise, some of which may
   require the attention of Congress. We will work closely with Congress
   should such needs arise. Long-term future needs include enhanced stream
   gauging operations in areas where flood probabilities are increased.
   Nationally, the network has decreased by 5 percent in the past 7 years,
   from 7,363 stations in 1990 to 6,959 in 1997. By working with its many
   partners in State and local agencies, as well as other Federal
   agencies, USGS is making every effort to continue operation of gauges
   needed for river flood forecasts. Longer lead times on flood forecasts
   would be of significant value to managers of water facilities.

   We look forward to working with Congress and this Subcommittee as this
   unprecedented weather event unfolds. We will continue to monitor
   conditions and respond to immediate concerns while at the same time
   adding to our store of knowledge about extreme weather and its effects.
   The lessons we learn will be useful in the future as we work to protect
   lives and property.

   Again, I appreciate the opportunity to appear before the Subcommittee
   and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.
