   ARTICLE C.1 Introduction.

   Functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) is being used to restore
   functional hand movements in quadriplegic individuals by electrically
   stimulating the paralyzed muscles in their hands and arms. The
   paralyzed individual controls his or her paralyzed muscles with a
   controller that translates wrist or shoulder position into a
   stimulation pattern that results in hand grasp. This FNS grasp system,
   utilizing implanted electrodes and stimulators, external shoulder or
   wrist position sensors, and open-loop control, is currently being
   evaluated in a multiple center clinical trial. If successful, the
   system should provide significant improvement in hand function to
   numerous C5-level quadriplegic individuals, essentially giving the C5
   injured individual a level of function that is better than a C6 injured
   individual treated with conventional therapy including tendon
   transfers.

   This contract will involve research, development, and feasibility
   testing of methods to enhance the function and control of FNS grasp
   systems. Research is needed to solve fundamental control problems of
   hand posture, command signals, and muscle excitation as well as
   developing means of providing sensory feedback. The research should
   lead to improved FNS function in C5 and C5/C6 injured individuals and,
   also, to applications in a broader range of quadriplegic individuals
   including C4 and C6 injured individuals.

   This proposed research project will evaluate closed-loop FNS systems in
   quadriplegic humans outside the laboratory environment. It will
   investigate the feasibility of implementing arm control such as elbow
   extension (to permit overhead reaching) and wrist control and will
   develop a biomechanical model of the human hand to improve strategies
   for hand posture control. The combination of closed loop FNS with
   surgical procedures such as tendon splicing, tendon transfer and
   arthrodesis will be studied to enhance hand posture control. The
   contractor will also cooperate with other investigators in evaluating
   new stimulator and transducer systems for FNS that are being developed
   by the Neural Prosthesis Program (NPP), National Institute of
   Neurological Disorders and Stroke .

   This RFP represents a competitive renewal of a contract that will
   expire in August 1995. A bibliography listing publications from current
   and prior NPP studies is available from the Neural Prosthesis Program,

   Article C.2 Statement of Work

   Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor
   shall exert its best efforts to study closed-loop control of hand grasp
   by functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) in an environment outside
   the laboratory. The contractor shall also investigate the feasibility
   of integrating wrist control, pronation and supination of the forearm,
   and elbow control into FNS hand grasp systems. These studies will be
   conducted, in part, in human subjects who have paralyzed upper
   extremities as a result of upper motor neuron lesions.

   Specifically the contractor shall:

   1. Obtain or develop a portable FNS hand grasp system that permits open
   or closed-loop control of thumb grasp force and thumb-index finger span
   in palmar and lateral grasp. This system shall also be capable of
   providing signals proportional to finger span and grasp force for
   sensory feedback.

   2. Investigate in quadriplegic volunteers, including women and
   minorities, the performance of hand grasp systems using closed-loop
   control and sensory feedback in activities of daily living outside the
   laboratory.

   3. Investigate in normal and quadriplegic volunteers, including women
   and minorities, methods of providing signals proportional to finger
   span and grasp force as sensory feedback to individuals who have lost
   tactile and propriopceptive sensation in the hand.

   4. Investigate in quadriplegic volunteers, including women and
   minorities, methods to enhance the function of FNS hand grasp systems.
   Potential areas for consideration include extending FNS control to the
   wrist, forearm, and elbow, FNS control of the intrinsic hand muscles,
   bimanual FNS, and innovative methods of control and sensory feedback.

   5. Develop a biomechanical model of the paralyzed hand and forearm that
   can be used to predict hand dysfunction based on known pathology
   including contractures, muscle imbalance, paralysis, and adhesions. The
   model shall also be capable of predicting the effect on hand control of
   interventions including tendon transfer and synchronization; selective
   fusing of joints in the fingers and thumb; of varying the muscles
   stimulated by FNS; and of providing slip, force, position, and contact
   feedback information in closed-loop FNS systems.

   6. Cooperate with other investigators in the Neural Prosthesis Program
   by collaboration and sharing experimental findings.
