   Habitat Conservation Planning Support

   habitat conservation planning (HCP) process is a program administered
   by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under its authority designated by
   the Endangered Species Act. HCPs, particularly the growing number of
   plans that cover large geographic areas and multiple species and
   habitats, address a complex array of ecological issues. The scientific
   information that underlies these plans must be reliable and thorough,
   and it is receiving greater scrutiny now than ever before. The U.S.
   Fish and Wildlife Service has placed increased emphasis on the
   development of defensible scientific information to support development
   and evaluation of HCPs.

   Scientists at the Western Ecological Research Center are making
   important contributions to the scientific foundations upon which HCPs
   are developed and analyzed. The primary areas of scientific support for
   HCPs are:
     * Ecological Field Data
     * Reserve Design
     * Impact Analysis
     * Ecological Monitoring
     * Planning and Decision Support
