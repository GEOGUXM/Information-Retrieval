Bioterrorism and CAM: What the Public Needs To Know
                                  __________________________________________________________________


The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)
understands the public's need to search for ways to protect itself from
      exposure to biological weapons. Many people are looking to
  complementary or alternative medicine (CAM) treatments to help them
prevent or treat diseases, such as anthrax and smallpox, that could be
used a weapons by terrorists. As a component of the National Institutes
  of Health, the nation's lead agency for medical research, NCCAM is
  charged with exploring -- in the context of rigorous science -- CAM
   approaches and practices, and giving the American public reliable
   information about the safety and effectiveness of CAM practices.

   What are NCCAM's recommendations regarding CAM and bioterrorism?
 While modern public health measures and medical advances can control
  diseases spread by bioterrorism, some people are seeking additional
measures to safeguard their health and the health of their loved ones.
  The public is asking about the appropriateness of CAM in regard to
                             bioterrorism.

  In dealing with the threat of bioterrorism, the best approach is to
   follow the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). (See the CDC Web site, which answers frequently asked
                      questions about anthrax, at
    http://www.bt.cdc.gov/DocumentsApp/faqanthrax.asp.) NCCAM fully
 supports the CDC recommendations for managing potential exposures to
   biological weapons. People should not place their faith in CAM to
provide adequate protection against the diseases used in bioterrorism.

 Why is CAM not appropriate for diseases such as anthrax or smallpox?
While advances in medical science in the past century have had a great
impact on the length and quality of life, there is still a great human
 burden of disease and suffering. Therefore, many people turn to CAM,
    hoping to harness their own, natural healing powers. While this
  approach may prove beneficial for some illnesses, and is a focus of
           much research funded by NCCAM (see our website at
http://nccam.nih.gov), there is no scientific basis to believe that CAM
    is likely to be of value against virulent infections spread by
                          biological weapons.

Diseases like anthrax and smallpox progress too rapidly for our immune
system's natural ability to control them. Simply stated, these diseases
   can kill us before our immune system can rally to defend against them.
   While many CAM practices do have a place in treating other conditions,
     especially in relieving symptoms, and in improving one's quality of
    life, in the case of bioterrorism, there is no CAM practice that has
    been shown to sufficiently stimulate the immune system to fight these
    deadly diseases. Nor do any dietary supplements or other CAM products
   have the potency to eliminate highly lethal microorganisms and toxins,
                     once they have entered our systems.

      What about Internet claims offering products to prevent or treat
                            bioterrorism agents?
   There are many Internet sites that claim their CAM products can protect
   against anthrax and smallpox. NCCAM is unaware of any scientific basis
   that these or other CAM therapies would be effective in protecting the
    public from biological or chemical weapons. (For more information on
      Internet claims, visit the Federal Trade Commission's website at
                http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2001/11/webwarn.htm.)

             Is NCCAM studying CAM for use against bioterrorism?
     NCCAM funds well-designed research on complementary and alternative
        medicine and welcomes proposals from researchers to study CAM
       approaches for major public health problems, including those of
     bioterrorism. Before a CAM remedy would be used for the diseases of
       bioterrorism, careful studies would need to be conducted in the
   laboratory and with animals to verify that the remedies are helpful and
     would not interfere with more conventional treatments. It would, of
      course, be unethical and dangerous to conduct research studies in
      people that withhold proven drugs and vaccines to see whether CAM
       remedies could protect or cure those exposed to fatal diseases
                     associated with biological weapons.

                                 In Summary
     Because there is no evidence in the scientific literature that CAM
    products are effective against diseases like anthrax or smallpox, the
    claims about these products are misleading and dangerous. In dealing
      with bioterrorism, the best approach is to trust in the currently
        approved drugs, vaccines, and related public health measures.
