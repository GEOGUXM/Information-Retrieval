      Welcome to City Hall, Rochester, N.Y., through the electronic door
      opened by the World Wide Web.

      This unique resource presents information about our City Government,
      presented for the first time within one 'document' that can be easily
      browsed & searched for what our customers (the citizens) need.

      We're happy to offer this website as one more avenue of communication
      with city and area residents, as well as an information center for
      interested electronic "visitors" from around the globe.

      As you explore our site, you'll find information about City services &
      projects, free event listings, recreational resources, business
      opportunities, home and neighborhood improvement programs, and City
      "problem solvers" to contact with your questions.

      You'll also be able to contact me or my staff via E-Mail to share your
      thoughts. We hope you'll offer suggestions on how our City Government
      and our Website can serve you better.

      Please use this resource and return as often as you need. You'll find
      that information is continuously updated and added to keep you current
      on our ever improving community.

      Sincerely,
      [signature.gif]
