   1. Engineering Responsibilities. The purpose of this chapter is to
   present and explain the operating procedures to be followed in
   achieving efficient and effective management of the National Weather
   Service's (NWS) engineering and maintenance programs. In optimizing the
   NWS's engineering programs with respect to utilization and control of
   workforce and resources, primary responsibility has been placed at the
   regional level for implementing policies and procedures emanating from
   the WSH. The contents of this chapter are intended for guidance in
   achieving the overall engineering program objectives at the
   Headquarters and regional levels and should be implemented in such a
   manner as to be consistent with regional responsibilities and control.

   As engineering activities continue to become more complex and
   widespread, coordination, guidance, and uniformity become increasingly
   important to assure compatibility of data in observational networks,
   reduce costs, minimize equipment downtime, and provide for orderly and
   efficient growth. This requires an effective organization capable of
   supervising and integrating existing engineering and maintenance
   functions and insuring the development of adequate programs for future
   systems. As such, the engineering organization consists of the
   functional technician personnel in the field and the necessary
   engineering support personnel at area, regional, and Headquarters
   levels.

   Engineering support includes such functions as administration,
   supervision, engineering, standardization, training, facilities,
   logistics, technical publications, major repair/overhaul facilities,
   and direct or indirect technical assistance. These functions must be
   consistent with engineering and maintenance requirements for providing
   the necessary support in meeting the missions of the NWS.

   Engineering responsibilities include the arrangements for and/or the
   establishment and maintenance of physical plant facilities. These
   physical plant facilities include NWS-owned buildings and grounds;
   radar towers and domes; inflation shelters; equipment shelters and
   installations; standby power plants; heating, ventilating; and air
   conditioning systems; and hardstand parking areas and driveways.

   1.1 National Weather Service Headquarters (WSH) Responsibilities. The
   Engineering Division has basic responsibility for guiding a successful
   program for engineering and maintenance of electronic,
   electromechanical, and other technical equipment and for the design and
   maintenance of facilities owned by the NWS. The Division is responsible
   for the preparation of specifications and technical documentation
   required for the procurement of safe, reliable, and maintainable
   meteorological and hydrological equipment and facilities. The Division
   is charged with insuring that precision and uniformity of measurement
   from instrumental systems throughout the NWS are achieved by
   establishing standards and procedures for governing the installation,
   maintenance, calibration, modification, and repair of instruments. The
   Engineering Division determines the requirements for technical
   maintenance programs and test equipment in support of current and new
   programs, including determination of workforce and budget requirements.
   Installation of accessories and the modifications of instrumental
   systems and equipment will not be made without prior coordination and
   approval of the Engineering Division. The Engineering Division is
   responsible for assuring that resources are available to maintain
   systems installed at field facilities.

   1.2 Regional Headquarters Responsibilities. The regional headquarters
   is responsible for managing a successful program of installation and
   maintenance of electronic, electromechanical, and other technical
   equipment and plant facilities required by regional activities in the
   performance of its assigned functions and in accordance with technical
   standards established by the WSR. Uniformity of techniques for
   observing and measuring weather conditions is of such importance in
   providing comparability of data for meteorological analyses and
   climatological studies that regional and local officials should
   emphasize national uniformity in weather measurement techniques. Since
   the primary purpose of environmental sensing equipment is the
   measurement, processing, and recording of environmental parameters, it
   follows that a program f-or the installation and maintenance of such
   equipment must be uniform and based on a common set of technical
   standards. If questions involving uniformity arise, they should be
   referred to WSH. Appropriate field action by the region will be
   instituted to fully activate and commission equipment and systems in
   accordance with prevailing directives. (See chapter A-34. The following
   summary of policy is included for emphasis).

   The commissioning of equipment and facilities or the acceptance of
   construction shall be delayed for no reason other than for failure of
   the installation to meet specified performance and/or engineering
   standards. Should it be determined that there are insufficient
   workforce and/or financial resources (OR&F) available to operate and
   maintain the new installation, the equipment and/or facility will first
   be commissioned and then "mothballed" until the necessary resources
   become available. In these cases, action will be taken to disassemble
   and store those components which would otherwise deteriorate due to
   exposure at the installation site. The Engineering Division will supply
   details for the disassembly and storage of components.

   Prior to commissioning, it is the responsibility of the regional
   engineering staff to inform the Regional Director of the status of
   support from the region and WSH Engineering Division for the following
   items:

       a.    Workforce to maintain the system.

       b.    Training of maintenance personnel associated with the system.

       c.    Availability of manuals and other technical material required
   for supporting the system at the site.

       d.    Availability of initial spare parts in logistic channels to
   support the system.

       e.    Establishment of performance standards for the particular
   system and whether maintenance personnel are acquainted with them.

   2. Coordination and Liaison. The engineering staffs must work closely
   with many NWS divisions and laboratories, NOAA organizational units,
   other Federal and local government agencies, and industry to fulfill
   their obligations. A full cooperative and joint effort must be
   exercised between the Engineering Division, Office of Technical
   Services, and the Systems Development Office, particularly during the
   final phases of equipment development and test and evaluation programs,
   to insure efficient operation of equipments within a minimum activation
   time. A close working relationship is maintained with the National
   Reconditioning Center during equipment purchase and inspection? and
   with the Central Logistics Supply Center for the purchase of
   maintenance spares and supplies required to support the NWS systems.
   Continuous liaison with the various divisions of the Office of
   Meteorology and Oceanography and Office of Hydrology are maintained to
   exchange operational requirements, budget information, and status of
   projects to assist in the coordination of NWS programs.

   There have been and will undoubtedly continue to be many cooperative
   programs with other Federal Government agencies and state and local
   governments. These programs include equipment procurement, calibration,
   maintenance, training, equipment interchange, and acquisition of
   property and facilities. It is the responsibility of the engineering
   staff to advise NWS management that proposed agreements are practicable
   and complete with respect to the engineering capabilities and
   resources.

   Contact with industry and scientific organizations is required to
   maintain state-of-the-art capabilities and to obtain knowledge of new
   commercial equipments and techniques to update equipments and increase
   capabilities of the NWS system.
