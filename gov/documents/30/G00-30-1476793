           This page showcases work performed by "You be the Scientist"
      participants - students grades 7 -12 and our COOLSPACE interns. Intern
       Chris Finegan recently developed a method for automatically enhancing
      and displaying GOES-8 (east) data and exporting it in a format that can
       be viewed in any web browser. The CONUS animations are updated every
        eight hours, at 06:50, 14:50, and 22:50 Eastern time. The Full Disc
       animation is rerendered every six hours, at 05:00, 11:00, 17:00, and
             23:00. You can email Chris any comments or questions at :
                                 cfineg1@umbc.edu.

   CONUS 320x200 (580 kb) | CONUS 640x400 (2 mb) | Full Disc 470x400 (850
                                    kb)

    You will notice that the speed of the animation is user-controllable.
   To slow down the animation, move your mouse to the far left edge of the
      image. Moving your mouse to the right will gradually speed up the
      animation. If the mouse cursor is moved off of the image, it will
       resume playing at the default speed of three frames per second.
