   NERSC uses the Multi Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG) developed by Tobias
          Oetiker. MRTG polls our network devices every 5 minutes and
          automatically generates daily, weekly, monthly and yearly graphs
          of the network traffic entering and leaving each device.

   Here is a typical MRTG graph:

   This particular one shows the daily network traffic on the ESnet
          interface. The y-axis is bits per second (b/s) and the capital M
          means mega-bps (Mb/s). The x-axis is time of day with a vertical
          red line at midnight. Traffic entering a network interface (in
          this case, from ESnet) is shown in green while traffic leaving a
          network interface (in this case, from NERSC) is shown in blue.
