   Now in Motion: The New IRS.gov



   Okay, you can stop holding your breath. It's finally here. (No, not
   your refund. But if you e-filed, you could have your refund by now!)
   It's the new IRS.gov web site.

   Some features may seem familiar, but many others will make your trip
   through IRS.gov easier. You'll find our Web site friendlier, with more
   information in fewer clicks. And it's just the beginning!

   We see IRS.gov as a Web site in motion. We'll keep working daily to
   enhance its features, to offer more capabilities, to reach more people.
   Explore irs.gov! And get information en Español!

   Remember this isn't just our IRS.gov. It's yours, too. So before you
   leave, give us your two cents (just kidding). Really, we want to hear
   your comments. So welcome to the new irs.gov! Bienvenidos! Welcome! Let
   the journey begin….

   … just a final note. Over the next few weeks you may see the old site
   pop up every now and then. No, we’re not trying to fool you and we’re
   not just taking a nostalgic look at the old site, we’re just stretching
   our legs. We may need to give the techies a chance to make changes that
   require the site to be off-line - hopefully you’ll never even notice.
   You may also see sections of the old site over the next several weeks
   if your Internet service provider has stored the old site on their web
   servers. You’ll get the whole picture once they update their sites.
