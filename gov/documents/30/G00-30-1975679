   Mail and Deliveries to DOE Headquarters Resumed

   As of November 19, 2001, the United States Postal Service has resumed
   delivery of mail to U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Headquarters
   facilities, Germantown, and its satellite buildings. Deliveries of
   courier packages and overnight carrier parcels have resumed to all
   buildings.

   Please be aware that a considerable backlog now exists in DOE
   Headquarters mail, and this may continue to slow DOE's response to your
   mail. DOE apologizes for any inconvenience caused during the suspension
   of mail delivery; however, the safety and well-being of all
   Headquarters employees is and will continue to be the foremost priority
   of the DOE organization.

   Note that you can still choose to contact DOE by phone, email or fax:

   DOE phone number: 1-800-dial-DOE

   DOE fax number: 202-586-4403
