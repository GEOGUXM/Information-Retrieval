      Welcome to the California Student Aid Commission's web site. You've
      arrived at a site that contains a wealth of information on State,
      federal, and institutional financial aid programs. All of this is
      intended to aid you: the student, parent, or school staff member as you
      search for answers on how to fund a post-high school education.
      Our mission is to "make education beyond high school financially
      accessible to all Californians." As you travel through this web site,
      we hope that it will provide you with the tools necessary for you to
      begin a postsecondary education experience, and assist you in
      completing your selected program. Ultimately, our hope is that through
      this educational access, you will experience a higher quality social
      and economic life, which will benefit California and the rest of the
      world.
