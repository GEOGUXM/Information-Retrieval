                             Course Description
   This course is designed to introduce students to the principals
   underlying the development of modern plant biotechnology. Basic
   concepts used in modern agriculture will be reviewed in light of
   emerging technologies that are affecting production practices and
   leading to new uses in crops. Emphasis will be placed on understanding
   the tools and strategies involved in optimizing plant productivity and
   development of new uses for plants. Issues related to the biotechnology
   industry and social concerns will also be discussed. Three lectures and
   or discussion periods will be held per week.

                                Examinations
   A one hour midterm and a three hour final exam will be given.
                              Course Evaluation
   The final grade will be assigned based on the percentage points earned
   relative to those earned by other class members. Student Papers: A 5
   page paper will be required on some contemporary aspect of plant
   biotechnology. This paper will be awarded a maximum of 100 points. Six
   of the best papers will be chosen for a 10 minute presentation to the
   class.
      Percentages will be calculated from the total points as follows:

   Event      # Points
   Midterm1   100
   Paper      100
   Final Exam 200
   Total      400
