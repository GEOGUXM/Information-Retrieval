   Agricultural Chemicals

      One of the focuses of the U.S. Geological Survey Toxic Substances
      Hydrology (Toxics) Program is investigation of the fate and occurrence
      of agricultural chemicals. Toxics Program agricultural chemical
      investigations focus on characterizing the processes that affect
      dispersal of chemicals in the atmosphere, ground water, and surface
      water; identifying persistent degradation products; and developing
      methods to measure these compounds in water samples at environmentally
      relevant concentrations. Results of these investigations are used by
      government regulators, pesticide manufacturers, farmers, water resource
      managers, and the public.

   Toxics Program Projects studying agricultural chemical transport and fate in
   regional or watershed settings:

        * Herbicides in the Upper Midwest Corn Belt
        * Cotton Pesticides across the Southern United States
        * Pesticides and potential ecological effects on the San Francisco
          Bay-Delta
        * Hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico
