   Principia Cybernetica Web


                         PCP Research on Intelligent Webs

      Different participants in the Principia Cybernetica Project are
      researching algorithms to inject more intelligence into the web, and
      into distributed knowledge systems in general. The main idea is that
      the different documents available on the web can be seen as nodes in a
      network, connected by a number of links, along which variable numbers
      of users travel in search for information. The resulting directed graph
      can be enhanced with weights (that, e.g., measure the frequency of
      usage) and semantic link types, and reorganized in order to provide
      better access to the knowledge that it contains. This makes it possible
      to "mine" the implicit knowledge distributed over millions of
      documents, the connections between them, and the way they are used.

      This knowledge can be used to improve the quality of the results that
      users get in return for their queries, point them towards relevant
      documents, reorganize the web to make it more efficient, and even
      discover wholly new concepts and relationships. Thus, the collective
      intelligence of the millions of users and authors of web information
      may be leveraged, turning the web from a mere repository of information
      into an adaptive, self-organizing knowledge system that actively
      "thinks" in interaction with its users.

      Such an intelligent web can be seen as a first step towards the "global
      brain", which according to our philosophy is the likely next stage in
      evolution. More generally, this research is inspired by the theoretical
      concepts and principles from cybernetics, systems, complexity,
      cognition, evolution and self-organization that underly the whole of
      the Principia Cybernetica philosophy. As such, it allows us to to
      formalize and operationalize some parts of the theory, and to test it
      by experiments and practical applications.

   Research centers

      This research is carried out mostly at the Center "Leo Apostel" at the
      Free University of Brussels (VUB), by Francis Heylighen, Johan Bollen
      and Alex Riegler, and at [externallink.GIF] Distributed Knowledge
      Systems Team, by [externallink.GIF] Cliff Joslyn, Luis Rocha and Johan
      Bollen, at [externallink.GIF] Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).
      The two groups collaborate closely, and keep contact with a number of
      related groups and centers, such as the Global Brain Group, the
      [externallink.GIF] Symbiotic Intelligence Project, and
      [externallink.GIF] Cognitive Technologies, inc. It is possible to join
      one of these groups as a researcher at the PhD or PostDoc level.

   Different approaches

      Various algorithms and techniques are being explored within the general
      paradigm of a distributed, self-organizing knowledge network. One basic
      paradigm, first developed by the Brussels group, is the one of the
      learning web, which sees links beween web pages as analogous to
      synapses in the brain, which adapt their connection strength to the
      frequency of their usage (the Hebb rule for neural networks). Another
      application is Luis Rocha's Talkmine system inspired by methods from
      fuzzy set theory, Pask's conversation theory and collaborative
      filtering. The two approaches are presently being integrated in the
      project on [externallink.GIF] Active Recommendation Systems for the
      Library Without Walls. A final approach developed by the Brussels group
      is the structuring of networks of concepts by "bootstrapping" the
      distinctions between concepts. This makes it possible to merge,
      differentiate or cluster different nodes in a network.

      In addition to these systems developed by us, we are exploring other
      methods to turn the web into an associative network (basically, a
      weighted, directed graph). A number of methods use existing links or
      connectivity patterns to compute the importance or "authority" of a web
      page for a given query. This makes it possible to cluster related pages
      into "communities" that cover a given subject domain. It is also
      possible to derive similarity weights between pages by using
      co-citation of pages or co-occurrence of words. This analysis of web
      connectivity patterns is complemented by a number of techniques used in
      collaborative filtering, which uses the similarity between users'
      preferences to recommend particular pages to particular users.
