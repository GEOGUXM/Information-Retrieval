   Referral & Review

        Last Updated: 1/29/2002

                         CSR Study Section Roster Index

   Welcome! Below is an alphabetical listing of CSR-chartered study
   sections by acronym, providing access to both Membership and Meeting
   Rosters, where available. Adjacent links provide:

     The full name and complete description of each study section

     Direct e-mail to the Scientific Review Administrator (SRA) for each
   study section

     Scientific review group Meeting Schedules

   In addition, CSR has several, on-going Special Emphasis Panels (SEPs)
   that meet as needed in specific scientific areas. These continuing SEPs
   are composed of temporary members only and do not have a permanent
   membership. For convenience, these SEPs are also listed below, along
   with links to a recent roster, descriptive information, and designated
   SRA email address.

   Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology
   Transfer Research (STTR) applications are reviewed in Special Emphasis
   Panels within CSR. The small business review panels are assembled on an
   ad hoc basis for each meeting; therefore, their designations and
   scientific emphasis may change with each review cycle. Brief
   descriptions of the small business review activities within each IRG
   are included in these Referral Guidelines. Additional information may
   be found on the page entitled Review of Small Business Applications.
   Roster information may be found on the page entitled CSR SBIR/STTR
   Meeting Rosters.
   Notice of CSR policy to all applicants ~ All rosters are provided for
   information purposes only. Do not communicate directly with study
   section members about your application. Direct all questions only to
   the SRA in charge of the study section. Failure to observe this policy
   strictly will create a serious breach of confidentiality and
   conflict-of-interest in the peer review process. Likely actions include
   removal of the investigator's application(s) from immediate review,
   coupled with delay and deferral of evaluation to a different review
   group in the following review cycle.
