   GOVERNOR DAVIS CLOSES BUDGET GAP WITH SMOKE AND MIRRORS

   CONTACT:Mike Wintemute

   (SACRAMENTO) Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks) today
   responded to the release of Governor Gray Davis proposed 2002-03 state
   budgetsaying the spending plan relies largely on smoke and mirrors to
   erase a $12.5 billion deficit.

   Shuffling money between accounts and delaying payments isnt a budget
   solution, said Cox. The governor is simply sweeping this deficit under
   the carpet with no intention of cleaning it up until after the November
   election.

   The governors spending plan relies on more than $7 billion in
   borrowing, accounting gimmicks and rosy assumptions in order to balance
   the budget. Davis has recommended only $5.2 billion in actual spending
   cuts.

   Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine), vice chair of the Assembly Budget
   Committee, commented, Governor Davis told us his three main budget
   priorities were education, education and education. Its now clear
   theyre defer, deflect and delay.

   As early as last June, Assembly Republicans warned the governor he was
   spending too much in the 2001-02 budget. Since Davis took office three
   years ago, state expenditures have increased 37 percent, while the
   population grew only five percent.

   Governor Davis tells us the true measure of leadership is how we master
   important moments, said Cox. This is your moment, Mr. Governorits time
   to lead.
