                                Introduction

   At NOAA's National Severe Storms Laboratory, we have begun a project to
   estimate the likelihood of severe weather hazards in the United
   States.  (Severe thunderstorms are defined in the United States as
   having either tornadoes, gusts at least 58 mph, or hail  at least 3/4
   inch in diameter.)  The figures are of three primary kinds:
    1. The average number of days per year with the event occurring within
       25 miles of any point (Total Threat).
    2. Animated loops of the probability of severe weather occurring
       within 25 miles of any point on a particular day with images once
       per week through the year (Animated Loops).
    3. Graphs showing the annual cycle of the probability of severe
       weather occurring within 25 miles at any point you select (Annual
       Cycles at Points [Clickable Maps]).

   For more information on the raw data that went into the figures and how
   it was processed, click here.

   US by Concannon,  Brooks, and  Doswell.
