Professional Regulation in New York State
     __________________________________________________________________

   In 1891, medicine became the first profession licensed by the New York
   State Board of Regents. New York's unique system of professional
   regulation, recognized as a model for public protection, has grown to
   encompass more than 645,000 practitioners and over 30,000 professional
   practice business entities in thirty-eight professions.

   Guided by the Regents, a citizen body, the professions are within New
   York State's unified system of education - The University of the State
   of New York. This recognizes the key role education plays in both
   preparing licensed professionals and in ensuring their continuous
   development.

   The State Education Department, under Regents direction, administers
   professional regulation through its Office of the Professions, assisted
   by the twenty-five State Boards for the Professions.

   Licensing, registration, and related fees are the sole means of support
   for professional regulation in New York State.* These fees support
   comprehensive services to the public and the professions. The Office of
   the Professions provides a number of services to the public and the
   professions, including the following:

   * 100% of registration renewal fees from physicians, physician

   Department of Health's Office of Professional Medical Conduct, which
   investigates complaints against physicians, physician assistants, and
   specialist assistants. The Department of Health also administers a
   program for licensees in these professions who have substance abuse
   problems. Cases of unlicensed practice may be pursued in conjunction
   with the New York State Attorney General.
