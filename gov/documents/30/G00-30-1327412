   SUMMARY


   Division B of the Conference Report on the Department of Defense
   Appropriations Bill (H.R. 3338, Public Law 107-117) appropriates $20.0
   billion in discretionary budget authority [BA] for fiscal year 2002.
   These appropriations were previously authorized and designated as
   emergency requirements by Public Law 107-38, the Emergency Supplemental
   Appropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to Attacks on the
   United States. Outlays flowing from these appropriations are expected
   to total $8.5 billion in fiscal year 2002, and $5.7 billion in fiscal
   year 2003. The Conference did not spend more than the $20 billion
   authorized, but allocated funds differently from the manner

   proposed by the President, the House, or the Senate. The table below
   shows the appropriations by agency, and calculates the difference
   between the enacted amount and the House-passed level.

   Except for the Department of Defense, all agencies received
   appropriations higher than the level passed by the House. The
   Department of Defense received $3.8 billion less than the amount
   appropriated by the House. Much of this decrease was used to provide
   increased funding for homeland security needs such as transportation
   safety, disaster preparedness, law enforcement and food safety.

   This document was prepared by the majority staff of the House Committee
   on the Budget. It has not been
   approved by the full committee and therefore may not reflect the views
   of all the committee's members.
              POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL SPENDING DEMANDS
    The following analysis compares the recommendations of the President,
     the House, the Senate Appropriations Committee, the Senate, and the
       Conference Committee. Examining the recommendations of each is
       instructive in determining the potential demands for additional
   spending in a fiscal year 2002 supplemental appropriations bill, or in
    the fiscal year 2003 budget. For the purposes of this analysis, it is
     assumed the President and House have the same unfunded priorities.
   Further, in identifying the Senate's unfunded priorities, the analysis
    looks not only at the $20-billion supplemental appropriation bill as
       passed by the Senate, but also at the additional $15 billion in
      supplemental appropriations reported by the Senate Appropriations
     Committee but not voted on by the full Senate. The following table
      shows the differences in enacted levels from recommended by major
                                  activity.

                           Total 5.1 1.1 9.6 15.8

   The analysis suggests there are $5.1 billion in unfunded priorities of
   the President and House in a fiscal year 2002 supplemental. That amount
   would fund Defense, the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA]
   (disaster relief), and Transportation (sky marshals). Also, there are
   $1.1 billion in additional unfunded priorities included in the
   Senate-Passed bill for FEMA, the Postal Service, and Military
   Construction. Further, the Senate may require action on the

   $9.6 billion in unfunded Senate priorities outlined in its reported
   bill for FEMA (New York City disaster assistance), the Department of
   Health and Human Services (Centers for Disease Control additional
   vaccines and State and local capacity building) and the Department of
   Justice (Immigration and Naturalization Service construction, and State
   and local preparedness grants), Military Construction, Postal Service,
   and Energy (weapons nonproliferation).

                                 CONCLUSION

   The President has signed into law $20 billion in fiscal year 2002
   emergency supplemental appropriations, an amount agreed to after the 11
   September attacks.

   Analysis of the different versions of those appropriations suggests
   potential unfunded priorities could result in a fiscal

   year 2002 supplemental appropriations bill as low as $5.1 billion and
   as high as $15.8 billion. The low end of this range merely reflects the
   shortfall from the needs identified by the President. The high end
   reflects other homeland security needs that may be funded in the
   forthcoming fiscal year 2003 budget request.
