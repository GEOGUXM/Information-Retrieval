   Resume Management

   The Resume Management module is introducing a new process and system
   that will change how NASA's Human Resources (HR) offices fulfill their
   recruiting and staffing responsibilities, and shift the role of HR
   professionals from administrators to consultative partners. It
   reinvents the manner in which applicants apply for jobs and how
   referral lists are provided to hiring managers. It also generates
   Internet job postings that allow employees and the general public to
   apply for NASA jobs using an on-line resume builder.
