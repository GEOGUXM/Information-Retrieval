Eating the right foods will help you live a longer, healthier life.
Many illnessessuch as diabetes, heart disease, and high blood
pressurecan be prevented or controlled through a healthy diet. It is
never too late to start eating right. Follow the simple guidelines
below.

Dietary Guidelines for Americans:

  * Eat a variety of foods.
  * Balance the food you eat with physical activitymaintain or improve
    your weight.
  * Choose a diet with plenty of grain products, vegetables, and
    fruits.
  * Choose a diet low in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol.
  * Choose a diet moderate in sugars.
  * Choose a diet moderate in salt and sodium.
  * If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation. (Moderation
    is no more than one drink daily for women and no more than two
    drinks daily for men.)

   Committee has evaluated the current food service options on the NIH
   campus. Working with the Division of Space and Facility Management,
   Office of Research Services and the food service contractors, the
   subcommittee identified three areas--vending, cafeterias, and
   catering--where improvements in food offerings and preparation
   techniques could be made.
     * Vending Machines
     * Cafeterias
     * Catering

   In addition, the Nutrition Subcommittee, along with the Division of
   Nutrition Research Coordination, cosponsors a variety of educational
   activities annually during the month of March.
