   The Galileo Spacecraft
   The Galileo Spacecraft The Machine Learning Systems (MLS) Group creates
   software solutions to hard problems requiring data mining, knowledge
   discovery, pattern recognition, and automated classification and
   clustering. The underlying emphasis is on building systems based on
   learning algorithms. We conduct basic research as well as develop
   applications leading to one-of-a-kind proof of concept systems. Our
   focus is on the automated analysis of scientific data generated by NASA
   and JPL instruments, on the development of technologies for adaptive
   systems, and on enabling technologies for autonomous spacecraft.
   We are located in JPL's Building 126 on the main campus in Pasadena
   adjacent to La Canada. For questions and further information, contact
   Dr. Eric Mjolsness, Eric.Mjolsness@jpl.nasa.gov.
