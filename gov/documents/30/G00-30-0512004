CARS Mission

   The goal of CARS is to develop X-ray beam lines at the APS and to make
   them available to the faculty and staff of its member universities, and
   to its scientific members, for frontier research. That is, our single,
   essential priority is to facilitate the conduct by our members of truly
   first-rate, basic scientific research which exploits the unique
   characteristics of the APS as an X-ray source to the full.

   CARS is unusual among all APS Collaborative Access Teams in that it is
   a large, interdisciplinary, multi- institutional Consortium with an
   extensive central design and technology team. This reflects our belief
   that the best science will in fact be carried out in an
   interdisciplinary mode; and that the substantial design and
   technological problems each discipline faces are best attacked in a
   central, cooperative manner.

   Two main themes are common to experiments in the several disciplines
   represented in CARS: the study of samples with which the X-rays
   interact very weakly because of, for example, their small size (area or
   volume), low concentration, large crystallographic unit cell
   dimensions, or necessity for monochromatic radiation of unusually
   narrow bandpass; and the study in a time-dependent manner of samples
   with which the X-rays interact much more strongly.
