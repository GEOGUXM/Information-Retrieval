                       U.S. Senate Rural Health Caucus

   As Republican Co-Chair of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, Senator
   Thomas is committed to ensuring rural America is at the forefront of
   the health care debate. He works with the Democrat Co-Chair, Senator
   Harkin, to present a unified voice for quality health care in rural
   areas. The Caucus was founded in 1985 as a forum to exchange ideas and
   information. Membership in the Caucus has grown steadily since its
   founding and today stands at 81 members.

   Senator Thomas and members of the Rural Health Caucus have worked hard
   this year to comprehensively address the needs of hospitals as well as
   the entire rural health care delivery system.

   In addition to cosponsoring the "American Hospital Preservation Act of
   2000" (S. 2018), Senator Thomas coauthored two rural health care bills,
   S. 2987 and S. 2735, with several colleagues. These bills take
   definitive steps to improve the rural health care delivery system.

   Recently, 27 members of the Rural Health Caucus joined Senator Thomas
   in sending a letter to Finance Committee Chairman William Roth (R-DE),
   urging his committee to address the unique needs of rural providers in
   its Medicare refinement bill.

   The final Medicare package negotiated with the White House includes a
   majority of the Caucus' requests. These rural specific provisions
   include:
    1. Revisions to the Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH)
       program that will apply the same eligibility criteria for payments
       to all hospitals.
    2. Sole Community Hospitals (SCHs) paid at a federal rate will be
       permitted to update their payments based on their 1996 costs,
       correcting a technical error in last year's Medicare refinement
       bill.
    3. Medicare Dependent Hospital (MDH) eligibility will be expanded by
       allowing more recent cost reporting years to be used for
       qualification.
    4. Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) will be paid on a reasonable cost
       basis for providing lab services. The bill also includes provisions
       to strengthen these crucial facilities by providing financial
       incentives to recruit providers.
    5. Improvements are made to telemedicine reimbursement such as
       eliminating fee-sharing and telepresenter requirements.
    6. Rural home health providers will receive bonus payments for the
       next two years.

   Additionally, full inflation updates are included for all hospitals,
   home health agencies, skilled nursing facilities and hospice providers.
   Arrangements that currently exist between small rural hospitals and
   labs for purposes of pathology services are protected.
