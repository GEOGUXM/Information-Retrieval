    CDF stands for the Collider Detector at Fermilab. CDF is an experiment
         at Fermilab, which is currently home to the world's most powerful
        particle accelerator called the Tevatron. The Tevatron accelerates
       protons and antiprotons close to the speed of light, and then makes
    them collide head-on inside the CDF detector. The CDF detector is used
         to study the products of such collisions; by doing this we try to
   reconstruct what happened in the collision and ultimately try to figure
      out how matter is put together and what forces nature uses to create
                                                      the world around us!
