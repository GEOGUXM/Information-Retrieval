   11:55 a.m. central time, returning the third resident space station
   crew to Earth after 129 days in space.
   The landing brought to an end a successful mission to carry a new
   resident crew, Commander Yury Onufrienko and Flight Engineers Dan
   Bursch and Carl Walz, to the station to begin a five month stay in
   orbit.

   Three Commander Frank Culbertson and his crew mates Vladimir Dezhurov
   and Mikhail Tyurin.
   During 12 days in space, the STS-108 crew worked with the two space
   station crews to deliver more than three tons of supplies to the
   station, while Linda Godwin and Dan Tani conducted a spacewalk to place
   thermal insulation on the motor assemblies that control the motion of
   the station's large solar arrays.

   for Endeavour and marks the 57th shuttle landing at the Kennedy Space
   Center.
