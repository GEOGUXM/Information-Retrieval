                          Smoke and wild fires in Eastern Siberia, Russia
          Date: 2001/216 - 08/04 01:00 UTC Smoke and wild fires in Eastern

   The MODIS Land Rapid Response system has been developed to provide
   rapid access to MODIS data globally, with initial emphasis on 250m
   color composite imagery and active fire data. The experience gained
   during the Montana fires of 2000, when the MODIS team was asked to
   provide active fire information to the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), has
   led to the improvement and automation of several of the steps involved
   in MODIS rapid data provision. Imagery and data are now being provided
   to the Earth Observatory, the USFS, and the National Interagency Fire
   Center (NIFC) and incremental improvements are planned both for the
   user interface and the selection of products.

   This research and development system has been developed as a
   contribution to rapid prototyping of NASAs NewDISS to provide new and
   innovative ways of building data and information systems for earth
   science data. The system builds on the experience gained with the MODIS
   Land 250m production and distribution system. The data delivery system
   is also being developed as a contribution to the Fire Implementation
   Team of the international Global Observation of Forest Cover Program
   (GOFC).

   The MODIS Land Rapid Response data are provided in addition to the
   MODIS Standard Land products, which can be obtained from the EDC DAAC.
   Generation of MODIS Standard Land products may lag several weeks behind
   current satellite acquisition and the Rapid Response Image
   availability.
