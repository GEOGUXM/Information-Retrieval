           Introduction ~ Get Started ~ Teacher's Guide ~ Feedback

   The ROVer Ranch is a place to learn about robotic engineering. You can
   learn about the development of robots, their elements and systems, and
          use a 3D VRML simulation to build and run your own robot.

      The ROVer Ranch learning activities are open to everyone without
     registering. If you'd like to use the robot simulations you need to
     register for an ID. When you register an ID and password, the ROVer
   Ranch software creates a workplace for you to store your robots, paths,
   scripts, and simulation information so they don't get lost or mixed up
                       with someone else's robot work.

   The ROVer Ranch uses JAVA 1.1 and a VRML plugin. The Login/Member area
    does not work with most Macintosh versions of browsers. Why is this?
                            This is Version 1.0.
