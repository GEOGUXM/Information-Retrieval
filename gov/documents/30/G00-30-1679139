   Sturgeon and Striped Bass Population Studies
   Conducts monitoring and research to determine long-term trends in
   abundance of juvenile and adult sturgeon and striped bass. Uses these
   data to evaluate factors affecting abundance and to make
   recommendations for changes in angling regulations and water management
   in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Estuary to increase sturgeon and striped
   bass populations.

   Fisheries Program
   Responsible for monitoring population trends of fish populations in the
   Sacramento-San Joaquin Estuary with emphasis on striped bass, young
   chinook salmon, and the threatened delta smelt. Evaluates factors
   affecting those population trends. Since water management has had major
   adverse impacts on the Estuary's fishes, the data have been essential
   to developing Department of Fish and Game (DFG) policy regarding water
   management and for evaluating potential mitigation measures such as
   stocking hatchery-reared striped bass.

   This program also manages the striped bass stamp fund which supports a
   variety of striped bass research and management activities including
   evaluations of stocking hatchery and pen reared yearling striped bass,
   law enforcement patrols and equipment, surveys of distribution and
   abundance of young striped bass, and studies at the DFG Aquatic
   Toxicology Laboratory which determines effects of pollutants on young
   striped bass and their food organisms.

   San Francisco Bay Study and Zooplankton/Neomysis Study
   Conducts studies to determine the abundance and distribution of
   zooplankton, mysids, shrimp, crabs and fish in the Western Delta and
   San Francisco Bay Estuary. Conducts focused studies to quantify the
   factors controlling abundance and distribution of these organisms.
   Information from these studies is used to evaluate water project
   operations and develop recommendations to minimize project impacts.

   Fish Facilities
   The Fish Facilities Unit conducts fish salvage (collection and
   transport) operations at the State Water Project's (SWP) John E.
   Skinner Delta Fish Protective Facility in Byron. The unit also
   processes and reports fish salvage data from the Skinner facility and
   from the Central Valley Project's (CVP) Tracy Fish Collection Facility.
   Additionally, the unit conducts fishery resource research in the
   Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary focused on the direct effects of
   water project facilities and on the development of new fish protective
   facilities associated with existing and proposed CVP and SWP water
   export and conveyance facilities.

   Water Project Planning Unit
   This unit is charged with the following responsibilities:

     * Assess the impacts of water development projects on plant and
       wildlife resources of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Estuary and other
       locations in the state, plus develop mitigation plans for these
       projects.
     * Provides assistance to DWR relative to their planning activities
       for the North and South Delta Water Management Programs.
     * Provides staff support for biological issues being addressed by the
       Bay-Delta Oversight Council and staff coordination for the
       Biological Technical Advisory Committee.
     * Continues fishery investigations in the Butte Basin, upper Feather
       River, and upper Sacramento River.
     * Provides Department response to projects obtaining a ACOE permit
       section 404 of the Clean Water Act, and section 103 of the Marine
       Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act.
     * Participates in specific committees, two of which are the Streambed
       Alteration Agreement Special Task Force and Delta Mitigation Issue
       Team.
     * Works cooperatively with the DWR to implement various facets of the
       Suisun Marsh Plan of Protection which includes collection of annual
       vegetation production data, triennial marsh-wide vegetation
       surveys, and monitoring waterfowl populations. Additionally, DFG
       serves as the lead agency on all environmental issues involving DWR
       within the Suisun Marsh and provides technical assistance to DWR
       for preparation of environmental documents.

   Selenium Verification Study
   The Selenium Verification Study is a continuation of a state wide
   investigation of selenium in fish and wildlife which began in 1985 and
   conducted under interagency agreement with the state Water Resources
   Control Board. Continuation of a USBR program investigating selenium in
   agroforestry habitats. Participates in a nationwide program conducted
   by EPA using newly developed protocols for stream assessment.

   Delta Smelt Study
   The delta smelt is a small fish endemic to the Sacramento-San Joaquin
   estuary. In recent years its abundance has declined precipitously. The
   USFWS and the DFG have recently listed it as a threatened species.

   This study will:

    1. improve understanding of the causes of the decline,
    2. monitor the population in order to identify changes in its status,
       and
    3. address management and recovery objectives.

   Such listings may substantially impact water management in California
   due to the effects on the delta nursery from diverting water from the
   delta. Therefore, to make appropriate recovery and management decisions
   based on the best available scientific information, an increased
   understanding of the delta smelt's environmental requirements and
   population regulating mechanisms are essential.

   The delta smelt study is a cooperative research effort by the DFG, DWR,
   USBR and contracted researchers. The study has been divided into the
   ten separate projects listed below. The agencies responsible for the
   work are also listed below. Data and research from other CVBDB projects
   is also used within these projects. DFG/CVBDB is responsible for
   organizing and presenting all the results.

     * Trawl, seine and substrate surveys of adult delta smelt
       distribution to define spawning areas and requirements. This is a
       joint project between DFG/CVBDB and the USFWS.
     * Determine characteristics to separate (identify) delta smelt from
       longfin smelt during early larval stages. This was done by
       contractor.
     * Determine temporal and spatial distribution and abundance of delta
       smelt larvae and their food supply. This is a joint DFG and DWR
       project with CVBDB doing most of the work.
     * Cohort identification from otoliths. This project is being done by
       CVBDB.
     * Measure effects of toxicity and starvation on larval delta smelt.
       This is a joint DWR, UC Davis and DFG project with UC Davis taking
       the lead.
     * Determine abundance, distribution and preferred habitats of older
       juvenile delta smelt. CVBDB is responsible for this project work.
     * Estimate losses of larval delta smelt at the state and federal
       water project diversions and local agricultural diversions in the
       delta. This is a joint project with DWR and USBR.
     * Continual monitoring of older juvenile and adult smelt salvage at
       the state and federal water project diversions, and reduce handling
       and trucking losses at these diversions. This work is being done by
       DFG/CVBDB and UC Davis.
     * Determine genetic differences between delta smelt, wakasagi and
       longfin smelt via electro phoretic analysis. UC Davis is performing
       this project.
     * Develop a computer model of delta smelt population dynamics and
       persistence. UC Davis is performing this project.

   The delta smelt study complies with mandate SWRCB Decision 1485 to
   conduct special fish population studies to meet specific needs, the
   mandates of the California Fish and Game Com mission in keeping with
   the California Endangered Species Act, and mandates of the Interagency
   Ecological Study Program MOU. This project is conducted under contract
   to DWR and USBR.
