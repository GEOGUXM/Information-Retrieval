              SAVE MONEY AND GET QUICKER NOTIFICATION WITH EBN!

     The Federal Court is introducing a new noticing technology by which
    certain bankruptcy noticing information is transmitted electronically
     to creditors who have requested the service. EBN is operated by the
         Bankruptcy Noticing Center (BNC) under the direction of the
    Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts and provides enhanced public
                        service while reducing costs:
     * Creditors receive notices days faster
     * Creditors reduce their processing expenses by replacing manual
       processes with automated procedures, and
     * BNC provides free technical support for creditors.

                           REQUESTING EBN SERVICE

    Bankruptcy Rule 9036, which authorizes electronic noticing, requires
   participants to sign an agreement with each bankruptcy court. Creditors
    can sign up from among three methods to receive electronic noticing:
     * Internet e-mail - For recipients who want the speed and convenience
       of receiving notices on-line. The BNC sends PDF file attachments by
       e-mail to creditors. Users must have an account with an e-mail
       provider that has "electronic delivery service notification"
       capability and have Adobe's free Acrobat Reader Version 4.0 or
       higher installed on their system.
     * Fax - For recipients who do not want to set up Internet e-mail
       accounts but who want to eliminate slower noticing by U.S. mail.
     * Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) - For high-volume recipients (200
       or more notices a week) who want to process data through
       computer-to-computer transfers.

   WHERE CAN CREDITORS GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE REQUIRED EDI SOFTWARE AND
                             OTHER INFORMATION?

     Visit the EBN Web page at http://www.EBNuscourts.com. The Web page
    includes a list of companies that sell and support EDI software that
      can be used for bankruptcy noticing. The cost of the EDI software
      varies greatly depending on the creditor's computer architecture.
      Technical questions posed by creditors interested in, or already
     receiving EDI notices will be answered by the BNC staff by calling:
                               1-800-262-5055.
