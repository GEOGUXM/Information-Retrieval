Summary

   Project accounts are called repositories (repos) and are funded, in
   most cases, annually by DOE's Office of Science. Every summer, between
   June and July, Principal Investigators apply for funding for both
   existing and new repositories.

   Allocations are made separately for the PVP Cluster, the MPP systems
   (T3E and SP) and HPSS. Active users may also obtain accounts for the
   visualization server (escher), the math server (newton) and the AFS
   shared file system.

   Account balances can be obtained by using the getnim command on the
   Crays and SP. General accounting and user information is available
   through the NERSC Information Management (NIM) web interface.

   How to Get a NERSC Account

   NERSC Information Management (NIM)
          Use the NIM web interface to view information about NERSC
          repositories and users. Principal Investigators and Repo
          Managers can also modify information.

   Introduction to NERSC Account Management
          Obtaining an allocation , allocation units, how allocations and
          login names are managed.

   NERSC Policies, Procedures and Forms

          + The Computer Use Policies Form must be signed and on file for
            every user.

   Job Priority Charging Method
          NERSC has implemented priority scheduling classes to give users
          some control over how quickly their jobs are scheduled for
          execution in the batch system.
