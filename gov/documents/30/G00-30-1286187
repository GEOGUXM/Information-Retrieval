   Mission Objective
   GRACE-twins
   GRACE
   unravels global climatic issues by:
   GRACE-line GRACE-line

   A new model of the Earth's gravity field with unprecedented accuracy
   every 30 days for five years
     * Enabling a better understanding of ocean surface currents and ocean
       heat transport
     * Measuring changes in sea-floor pressure
     * Watching the mass of the oceans change
     * Measuring the mass balance of ice sheets and glaciers
     * Monitoring changes in the storage of water and snow on the
       continents


   Mission Characteristics
   GRACE-line

   Launch into polar orbit from Plesetsk

     Near the next solar maximum
   Two satellites in tandem formation

     Loosely controlled, 170 to 270 km apart
   Initial orbit altitude is approximately 480 km

     Decays to re-entry near the solar minimum
   Mission life is approximately 5 years

                              GRACE-solarcycle


   The Twin GRACE Satellites are the Instrument
   GRACE-line

   Variations in the gravity field cause the range between the two
   satellites to vary

   The relative range is measured by a high-accuracy µ-wave link, which is
   integrated with a GPS receiver

   The measured range variations are corrected for non-gravitational
   effects by an electrostatic accelerometer
