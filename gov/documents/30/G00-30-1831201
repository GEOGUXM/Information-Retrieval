      The Office of Inspector General (OIG) was established within the
      Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1989 as required by the Inspector
      General Act Amendments of 1988 (5 U.S.C., App.3). The OIG promotes the
      economy, efficiency and effectiveness of FTC programs and operations.
      To this end, the OIG, as an agent of positive change, strives to
      continually improve FTC management and program operations,
      independently conducting audits and investigations to find and prevent
      fraud, waste, and abuse within the agency.

      The OIG, because of its unique and independent role within the agency,
      does not conduct investigations of possible violations of laws, rules
      or regulations assigned by statute to FTC enforcement staff. Further,
      in carrying out its investigative responsibilities, whether conducting
      criminal, civil or administrative investigations, the OIG does not take
      sides on particular agency investigations or enforcement matters.
      Nevertheless, the OIG does place a high priority on investigating
      allegations or matters that negatively impact on the overall integrity
      of the FTC's consumer protection and antitrust law enforcement
      missions.

      FTC employees and the general public may at any time anonymously or
      confidentially call the OIG's chief investigator directly on: (202)
      326-2581, to report suspected wrongdoing by FTC employees, or to
      present allegations of possible fraud, waste or abuse occurring within
      or compromising an FTC program or operation. If anonymity is not a
      primary concern to a complainant, the OIG's chief investigator can be
      contacted on the OIG's direct fax line: (202) 326-2034. For general
      inquiries about the IG Act or the FTC OIG and its operations, the
      public should call the main OIG phone number: (202) 326-2800.

      Consumer complaints and inquiries about possible law violations that
      are within the investigative purview of FTC enforcement staff should
      not be reported to the OIG, but rather to the FTC's Consumer Response
      Center (CRC). Such possible law violations under enforcement staff's
      authority include various deceptive acts or practices which could
      constitute a violation of the FTC Act, and activities which might
      violate one or more of the numerous other laws, rules and regulations
      enforced by the FTC (for example, the often consumer-referenced: Fair
      Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the
      Telemarketing Sales Rule).

      The CRC can be reached by telephone on (202) FTC-HELP / 382-4357, or
      through the Internet at www.ftc.gov, on which consumers can also
      access, complete and transmit to the CRC the FTC's Public Complaint
      Form. All general inquiries about the FTC and its activities, other
      than related to the OIG, should be directed to the agency's public
      telephone number: (202) 326-2222, which has menu options to connect
      callers to the CRC, as well as the agency's press and personnel
      offices, and to other frequently called FTC numbers.
