The Auxiliary I/O

   A Mini-DIN 8-pole external connector is provided for auxiliary
   connections to the camera server. This page discusses the additional
   functionality that this connector provides.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Physical connection

   The Auxiliary I/O connector provides the interface to one relay switch
   output and two digital inputs.

    Pinout

   A pinout table and diagram for the connector is detailed below:

          (enlarged)

   Pin Function
   1 - Relay switch (Max 24V AC/DC, 100mA)
   2 - Relay switch (Max 24V AC/DC, 100mA)
   3 - Iris output signal
   4 - N/C
   5 - Auto Iris Lens power (+12V max 50 mA)
   6 - Input 1
   7 - Input 2
   8 - Ground

   Note:
   GND on the IO connector is not connected directly to the power
   connector. Always use two independent power sources! Connecting GND to
   the power connector will permanenly damage your camera server.

  Controlling and Monitoring

    I/O Files

   The status of the input/output interface can be monitored and
   controlled by the IO software within your camera server. From your Web
   browser, you can access the IO control file in order to either drive
   the relay output or monitor the status of the digital inputs. To access
   the IO files enter one of the following URLs:

     http://cameraname/io/input.txt
     http://cameraname/io/relayon.txt
     http://cameraname/io/relayoff.txt

   You will require root access to reach these files and may now be asked
   to supply a username and password. Login as root and supply the root
   password (default password is pass).

  Relay Output

   You can use this output to drive directly a maximum load of 24V AC/DC
   at 100mA. By connecting additional relay circuitry, you can also use
   this output to drive heavier loads.

   You can drive the relay off and on simply by clicking relayoff.txt or
   relayon.txt. Clicking on either of these will return either of the
   following messages, respectively:

     Relay is On
     Relay is Off

   Note:
   You can also control the relay switch via a CRON script using the
   snapshot command.

  Digital Inputs

   The two digital inputs on pins 6 and 7 of the connector makes it
   possible to trigger your snapshots on chosen events. However, you must
   use a CRON script to implement this functionality.

   By connecting a digital microcircuit to a particular door for example,
   it is possible to take a snapshot on each occasion that it opens or
   closes.

   Status information for each of the two digital inputs is presented
   within a text string. The status of the inputs may be read by
   clicking on the input.txt. The string will amongst other things define
   the time and duration of the last trigger event for the each input:

   input:1 current:0 last:1 time:12.22 pulse:2
   input:2 current:1 last:0 time:14.46 pulse:6

     This table describes each digital input text string:

   String   Description
   input:   Input reference (Input 1= pin 6, Input 2 = pin 7)
   current: Current port status (Logical high = 1, Logical low = 0)
   last:    Status before last read operation
   time:    Time of the last read operation
   pulse:   Elapsed time (number of pulses received since the last read
            operation)

   The way in which you use the auxiliary connector is of course for you
   to decide. Axis does not provide application software, but instead
   allow you to determine how this connector is best utilized. Naturally,
   we would be more than pleased to learn of any interesting applications
   that you might develop!
