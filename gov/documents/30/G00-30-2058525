Welcome to the USGS

   The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), established by Congress in the
   Organic Act on March 3, 1879, provides geologic, topographic,
   hydrologic, and biologic information to the Nation. This information
   comprises maps, data bases, and reports containing analyses and
   interpretations of water, energy and mineral resources, biological
   resources, land surfaces, geologic structures, natural hazards, and the
   dynamic processes of the Earth.

   While the Organic Act has been amended over time, the central mission
   of the USGS has largely stayed the same. Things that have changed are
   the tools and talents used to help the USGS meet the scientific needs
   of a changing world. Key activities conducted by the USGS in fulfilling
   its mission are:
     * Collect and analyze data on the quantity and quality of surface and
       ground water, on water use, and on the quality of precipitation.
       Assess the impact of human activities and natural phenomena on
       water resources.
     * Assess energy and mineral resources, develop techniques for their
       discovery, and evaluate the impact of their extraction.
     * Provide the scientific understanding and technologies needed to
       manage the Nationâ€™s biological resources.
     * Produce and update geographic, cartographic, and remotely sensed
       information in both graphic and digital form.
     * Describe the onshore and offshore geologic framework of the Nation
       and develop an understanding of the formation and evolution of that
       framework.
     * Evaluate hazards associated with earthquakes, volcanoes, floods,
       droughts, landslides, and toxic materials. Develop methods for the
       prediction and mitigation of such hazards.

   The USGS cooperates with and coordinates its efforts with nearly 1,200
   agencies at Federal, State, county, and municipal levels, and with
   other nations and international organizations. The headquarters of the
   USGS is located in Reston, Virginia. Three regional centers are located
   in Denver, Colorado; Menlo Park, California; and Reston, Virginia.
   District and field offices are located throughout the 50 states, the
   Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Trust Territories of the Pacific.

The Montana District

   The Montana District investigates the occurrence, quantity, quality,
   and movement of surface water and ground water in Montana and adjacent
   areas. The District also serves as a point of contact and liaison for
   all USGS activities in Montana. District activities are conducted
   through the District Office in Helena and Field Headquarters Offices in
   Helena, Billings, Fort Peck, and Kalispell. Addresses and contact
   information for these offices are:

   The activities of the Montana District are supported by funds
   appropriated directly to the USGS, by funds from other Federal
   agencies, and by funds and services provided by State, local, and
   Tribal agencies matched with Federal funds. Activities include
   monitoring of streamflow at more than 200 sites statewide; providing
   real-time information for more than 100 of those sites; monitoring
   water quality in the Clark Fork, Missouri, and Yellowstone River
   drainages; and conducting investigations and applied research of the
   quantity and quality of surface and ground water in various areas
   throughout the State. Additional information about these activities is
   available through links on our main home page.
