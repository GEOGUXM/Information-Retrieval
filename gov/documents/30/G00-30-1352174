   Biography: Dr. Schneider is a Research Biologist in the Section of the
   Chief , Laboratory of Experimental and Computational Biology, Division
   of Basic Science, National Cancer Institute. Dr. Schneider received a
   B.S. in biology at MIT in 1978 and received his Ph.D. in 1984 from the
   University of Colorado, Department of Molecular, Cellular and
   Developmental Biology. His thesis was on applying Shannon's information
   theory to DNA and RNA binding sites. He is continuing this work at NIH
   as a tenured research biologist. Using information theory, the commonly
   used consensus sequences, can now be replaced with two kinds of
   graphic: sequence logos and sequence walkers. The walkers can be used
   to predict whether or not splice junction sequence changes are
   polymorphisms or mutations and in the latter case the severity of the
   resulting disease. By introducing the relationship between energy and
   information, Dr. Schneider is also applying the theory to many other
   molecular systems.

            - with a curious break! I came to NIH in late 1987, so the
            break might represent the delay to get my stride. Also, 1990
            is the date of the publication of sequence logos with my first
            SIP student, both seminal events. For the doubting Thomases
            amongst you

            On a log scale and it curves down in both parts. I am not
            capable of exponentially publishing! 8^}
