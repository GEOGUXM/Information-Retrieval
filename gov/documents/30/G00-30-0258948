                           Setting the Sample Flows

         Constant and adequate sample flows are required for reproducible
      results on the CATS system. Adequate sample flow is required to insure
            that the sample loop is flushed clean of previous gases and
       contaminates. Constant flow between all four sample loop positions is
      needed to reduce any systematic problems with loading the sample loops.
                    Below is a method for setting sample flows:
       1. Shut down the data acquisition software by pressing CTRL-C in the
          rungc screen and then typing "quit" in the "chroms" screen.
       2. Start-up the "labdoit" program by opening a new shell and typing
          labdoit. labdoit is a program very similar to the standard data
          acquisition software but it does not do injections. The operator
          also has control of the GC via the commands at the bottom of the
          "chroms" screen.
       3. To check a flow, simply step the stream selection valve (SSV) to
          the port of interest. You may have to wait for up to a minute for
          the flow to register on the "chroms" screen.


   Sample Stream

                Port #

   Cal 1

                2

   Air 1

                4

   Cal 2

                6

   Air 2

                8

       4. To change a cal tank flow rate, adjust the cal tank regulator
          pressure. To change the air flow rate, adjust the back-pressure
          regulator on the pump board.
       5. Once all of the flows have been set to approximately the same value
          quit the labdoit program. Simply type quit in the "chroms" screen.
       6. To start the data acquisition software again. Type "rungc" in an
          open shell window.
