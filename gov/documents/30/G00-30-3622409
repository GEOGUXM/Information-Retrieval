   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Is jury duty mandatory?

   Yes. The United States Constitution guarantees the right to a trial by
   jury in both criminal and civil cases. Your participation as a juror
   helps make that possible.


   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   What if I receive a Juror Qualification Questionnaire?

   Juror Qualification Questionnaires are sent to people randomly selected
   from the voter rolls (these are not to be confused with the update
   cards mailed with your first summons). The questionnaires are used to
   determine who is qualified to serve jury duty. Please complete the
   form, sign it, and return it in the business reply envelope. There is a
   space on the back of the form if you wish to write a message. If you
   claim a medical hardship you must include a doctor's note. If you
   recently served jury duty in another court, you must include a copy of
   your jury certificate. If you are found to be qualified for jury
   service, you will receive a Summons to Jury Duty at a later date.


   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   How often must I serve?

   Under Federal law, a person cannot be required to serve jury duty more
   often than once every two years. If you have served 30 days or more in
   the United States District Court or a West Virginia State Court within
   the last two years, and wish to be excused, please mail a copy of your
   official jury certificate, together with our summons, in the return
   envelope.


   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   How long will I serve?

   Jurors for the Northern District of West Virginia are required to: (1)
   be on call for a period of three months after the first call, (2) be
   called for juror service no more than five times during the three
   months of service, except when necessary to complete service in a
   particular case, (3) to serve, after being sworn as a juror, on one
   petit jury. Or more simply put you will generally be required to serve
   for three months or one trial.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Why must I call the evening before I appear for jury duty?

   The Court's schedule sometimes changes at the last minute. Rather than
   have you sit in the jury room all day, we may change your date to
   report. It is therefore important to call the telephone number printed
   on your summons on the evening (or weekend) before the summons date.
   You will hear a recorded message, available after 5:00 P.M. the day
   before your scheduled date of service. The recording may direct you to
   report to the courthouse on the summons date, or it may delay your date
   to report by up to one week.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   -

   Can I get a postponement or permanent excuse?

   If you would like to postpone your jury service to a more convenient
   time, use the return envelope to mail the summons and a brief note
   indicating when you can serve within the next six months. However, if
   your summons states "No Further Postponements", then you have exhausted
   your postponements and must serve.

   If you are seeking to be permanently excused, mail the summons, the
   completed update card, a full note of explanation and any supporting
   documentation, such as a doctor's note, certificate of prior jury
   service or proof of a new address (yellow postal forwarding sticker,
   copy of a new drivers license or utility bill).

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Why must I serve in Wheeling, Clarksburg, Martinsburg or Elkins?

   The Northern District Federal Courts has four federal courthouses that
   have been designated as "points of holding court" located in Wheeling,
   Clarksburg, Martinsburg, and Elkins. Each of the four divisions has a
   designated geographic area from which to draw jurors consisting of as
   few as four counties for the Martinsburg Division and as many as twelve
   for the Clarksburg Division. Therefore, where you serve as a juror
   depends on your county of residence.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   --

   Will I be paid for my jury service?

   The U.S. District Court will pay you, by check, an attendance fee of
   $40 per day plus a travel fee of 31 cents per mile, paid round trip, to
   your home town. The mileage fee will cover the costs of public
   transportation, and you do not need to submit receipts. Federal
   employees, instead of the attendance fee, will receive their regular
   pay. The attendance payment is taxable income and should be declared.
   The travel payment is not taxable. Jurors who earn over $600 in
   attendance income in one calendar year will receive a 1099 Form.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   -

   What if I drive my car to jury duty?

   The Court will pay your parking costs, over and above the mileage. The
   Court does not own a parking lot for jurors. Park in a private or
   municipal parking lot. You will be given a parking slip to fill out so
   that you can be reimbursed for your parking.


   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   -

   Is there a dress code?

   While no formal dress code exists, jurors are requested to dress in a
   manner respectful to the Court. You will have to pass through a metal
   detector each time you enter the courthouse. Please leave excess metal
   and jewelry at home to speed your entry.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   -

   Can I bring my cellular telephone, tape recorder, camera, beeper or
   computer?

   Cellular telephones, tape recorders and cameras are prohibited inside
   the courthouse and will be checked at the door. Computers, and beepers
   set on silent mode are permitted. Public telephones are available
   throughout the courthouse.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   -

   How can I get proof of my jury service?

   When you finish serving, the Court will automatically mail a
   certificate of jury service to your home upon your request. It will
   arrive about one week after you complete your jury service. The
   certificate will list only the days you were present in the courthouse.
   After serving you are exempt from jury service in any other court for
   at least the next two years. Keep the original certificate, it is the
   only way to prove your jury service if you are summoned by another
   court.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   How can I speak to a jury clerk?

   To reach the jury department please call 1-800-333-5879 ext 241 between
   the hours of 10:00 a.m, and 4:00 p.m.

   Jurors should not use e-mail to contact the Court.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Finally a word of thanks...

   By serving jury duty you are participating in the administration of
   justice. There is no more valuable service that a citizen can perform
   in support of our democratic Government than the good faith performance
   of jury duty. We hope you find your jury service to be an interesting
   and rewarding experience.
