Systematic error in the energy calculation neglecting 2nd order terms in the
calculation of dL

   *
   Purpose of this analysis is to estimate the systematic error on the 1st
   order calculation of dL, neglecting the higher order terms of the beam
   displacement. This is done in one particular case: considering the
   reference orbit as the central orbit. This is the case that one wants
   to study because, in the general case, one has to consider the
   variation of the displacement of the reference orbit along s (position
   around the ring). This quantity is difficult to measure in practice
   because the BPM system is not "absolutly" calibrated.

   Considering the central orbit as reference orbit, it is possible to
   exactly calculate the orbit length for a general orbit as
   L = cyclic int (sqrt ( f(s) ) ) ds , where
   f(s) = (1+X/ro)^2 + (dX/ds)^2 (for bent sections) and
   f(s) = 1 + (dX/ds)^2 (for straight sections)
   (X: beam displacement at the position s, with respect to the reference
   orbit;
   ro: average bending radius of the bent sections)

   Because the reference orbit is the central orbit, it is NOT possible to
   use this "exact" calculation to get physical results. ALL OF THIS IS A
   TEST OF THE 1st ORDER ALGORITHM TO CALCULATE dL.

   It has been compared the "exact" dL with the 1st ord. dL for the stable
   run

   in three different configurations of BPM saturation:
     Sat. OK: the configuration used is the correct one for the given run
     No Sat. BPMs: all the BPM are considered NOT saturated for all the
       run
     Lot of Sat. BPMs: the BPM are considered saturated for all the run
       like in run 2369 (stack 49 etac). This is one of the worst
       situation:
       Saturated BPMs: 104 106 108 204 206 306 406 508 603 606 608
       BPMs close to saturation: 101 103 506 601

   The results are summarized in this plot:

   In average, the 1st order dL understimate the "real" dL for 80 um (Sat.
   OK value). Furthermore, the error slightly depend upon dL: in the case
   of Sat. OK (slope = 1.002), this means that the 1st order calculation
   of dL = 10 mm is underestimated by 60 um and of dL = -10 mm by 100 um.
   This is an error of ~15 KeV in energy in the worst case.

   These are the table of data:
   correct saturation pattern for the given run
   BPMs considered NOT saturated
   BPMs considered saturated like in run 2369
