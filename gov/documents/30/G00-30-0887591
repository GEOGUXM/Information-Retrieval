   The ENPEP package is distributed under the auspices of the U.S.
   Department of Energy (DOE) and the International Atomic Energy Agency
   (IAEA). The distribution of the package is subject to the recipient
   institution's acceptance and signing of the "Basis for Release".
   Institutions and organizations from the United States that are
   interested in obtaining the ENPEP package (or part of ENPEP) may
   contact Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). Contact can be made via
   email at enpep@anl.gov or via the following Argonne liaisons:

   Interested institutions from all other countries should first check the
   list below to see if there is already an IAEA Liaison Officer for the
   ENPEP package in their country. All requests for information and,
   eventually, to obtain the ENPEP model should be directed to the
   corresponding in-country IAEA Liaison Officer.

   If there is no IAEA Liaison Officer established for the country, the
   request can be submitted to the IAEA:

   alphabetical listing of liaison officers by country.

   We also have a list of which countries have completed the training
   course in energy planning at Argonne National Laboratory.
