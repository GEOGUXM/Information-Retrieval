   Hello and Welcome!
   The Town of Davie is home to over 70,000 residents who live across 34.4
   lush square miles. The Town's rural atmosphere with a Western Theme
   fosters an environment that separates Davie from all other
   municipalities in Broward County. Our green open spaces, parks and
   miles upon miles of our trail system is quiet conducive to an quiet,
   relaxing and even an equestrian life style which you just can't find in
   today's growing South Florida.
   We are also the nexus of South Florida for higher education in which
   several nationally known colleges, technical institutes and
   universities reside that make up the South Florida Educational Center
   (SFEC). Plus, we're home to the Miami Dolphins who you can catch daily
   practicing at Nova Southeastern University!
   Davie's business climate ranges from the small proprietors to the head
   quarters of fortune 500 firms such as Andrx Pharmaceuticals. Nestled
   among thoroughfares such as the Ronald Reagan Turnpike, I-595, and I-75
   not to mention the closeness of the Ft. Lauderdale/Hollywood
   International Airport and Everglades Seaport--Davie is most ideal!
   Please feel free to come by and visit us sometime....you'll feel right
   at home in this great space called Davie.

   Yours truly,

   Tom Willi
   Town Administrator
