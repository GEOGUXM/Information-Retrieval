       The FAA is required by the U.S. Congress to promote the safe and
       efficient use of America's airspace. CAMI promotes aviation
       safety through aeromedical education programs that:

       + Train and evaluate the Aviation Medical Examiners, a
         specialized group of approximately 5,500 physicians located in
         the U.S. and in 84 countries around the world, appointed by
         the FAA to perform the required airman medical examinations.
       + Train civil aviation pilots & aircrews in aviation physiology
         & global survival skills.
       + Disseminate aeromedical information to the civil aviation
         community through publications and participation (lectures and
         practical demonstrations) in the National Aviation Safety
         Program.
