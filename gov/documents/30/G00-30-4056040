   Convert PDF to HTML

   Use the following link to convert any pdf file on this site to HTML on
   the fly. Select here:http://access.adobe.com/simple_form.html

   Adobe Acrobat Reader

   In order to access PDF files, Adobe® Acrobat® Reader software must be
   used. If you currently have this software installed on your computer,
   your browser may already be configured to use the Adobe® Acrobat®
   Reader as a "helper application." That means you can automatically view
   a PDF file when you select it on a web page. Otherwise, you can first
   download the PDF file and then use Adobe® Acrobat® Reader to view or
   print PDF files.

   If you do not have the Adobe® software installed, your browser may give
   you the option of downloading and saving PDF files for later viewing
   and printing. In this case, you do not need to configure your browser,
   but you will still need to have the Adobe® software installed in order
   to access the downloaded PDF files.

   It is also highly recommended that PDF files be printed on a
   PostScript® printer, if one is available. Although PDF files may print
   legibly on other printers, a PostScript® printer will ensure a correct
   rendering of the document.

   If you do not have the Adobe® software installed, you can install it by
   downloading a free copy. Please note that the system requirements for
   this software are: 4 MB of RAM, 5 MB of hard disk space, plus 7 MB of
   additional temporary disk space available during installation. For
   instructions, go to the Adobe® site at
   http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html
