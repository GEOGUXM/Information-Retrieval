            Disability Access Inspections for the 105th Congress
                Summary of Access Standards for Office Space

   The Congressional Accountability Act requires the General Counsel of
   the Office of Compliance to inspect facilities covered by the Act for
   compliance with disability access standards at least once each Congress
   and report to Congress on the results of the inspection. Section 210
   (f), 2 U.S.C. ยง 1341(e).

   The inspection for the 105th Congress will start in the Fall of 1997.
   The facilities of the following legislative branch entities will be
   inspected:
     * each office of the Senate, including each office of a Senator and
       each committee;
     * each office of the House of Representatives, including each office
       of a Member of the House of Representatives and each committee;
     * each joint committee of Congress;
     * the Capitol Guide Service;
     * the Capitol Police;
     * the Congressional Budget Office;
     * the Office of the Architect of the Capitol;
     * the Office of the Attending Physician;
     * the Office of Compliance

   Facilities located within Washington, D.C. will be inspected by
   inspectors from the Office of the General Counsel. Offices will be
   notified of the inspection date for their building about a couple of
   weeks before the scheduled date.

   The Home State offices of Senators and District offices of Members of
   the House Representatives located throughout the country are also
   required to comply with disability access standards. Because there are
   more than 1,000 State and District offices located across the country,
   it is impractical for the General Counsel to conduct an individual
   physical inspection at each location. Therefore, these offices are
   being inspected by means of a questionnaire to be completed by each
   office. The questionnaires were sent out in late July for return to the
   Office of Compliance by September 22, 1997. A designated representative
   of each office must sign to verify the completeness and accuracy of the
   information provided.

   The Office of the General Counsel has developed a Checklist of
   Disability Access Standards for Office and Administrative Areas. This
   checklist summarizes the disability access standards that apply to
   office and administrative areas and lists resources available to assist
   Congressional offices in making programs, activities and services
   accessible to constituents and other members of the public with
   disabilities. It also contains information on how to use telephone
   relay services.
