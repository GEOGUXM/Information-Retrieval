     * Reciprocated hosting and sending of students by participating
       families.
     * CIRF financial and district support.
     * Students are asked to cover travel expenses (approx. $800-1250)
       subject to CIRF financial assistance based on need.
     * Consulate of Japan providing diplomatic and coordinating services.
     * Enrollment of participating students in summer school enabling ADA
       support.
     * School districts complete control over student selection.
     * Minimal staff ratio of 1 teacher per 15 pupils.
