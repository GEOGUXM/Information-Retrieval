   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

   Where do pharmacists work in the Public Health Service (PHS)
   Commissioned Corps?

   The 760+ pharmacy officers in the PHS Commissioned Corps work in a
   variety of agencies/programs throughout the Department of Health and
   Human Services (HHS) and in other Federal agencies.  The majority of
   pharmacy officers are assigned to the following:
     * Indian Health Service (IHS) (approximately 50%);
     * Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (approximately 20%); and
     * Bureau of Prisons (BoP) (approximately 15%).

   What are the entry requirements?

   You must:
     * be a U.S. citizen;
     * be under 44 years of age (age may be offset by prior active-duty
       Uniformed Service time and/or civil service work experiences in a
       PHS agency at a PHS site at a level commensurate with the duties of
       a commissioned officer);
     * have served less than 8 years of active duty if you are/were a
       member of another Uniformed Service (click here to access the
       Former/Current Uniformed Service members section);
     * meet medical requirements; and
     * pass an initial suitability investigation.

   In addition, you must have earned a B.S. or Pharm.D. degree from a
   program which, at the time of graduation, was accredited by the
   American Council on Pharmaceutical Education (ACPE).  A current,
   unrestricted, and valid pharmacy license in any of the 50 States,
   Washington D.C., the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin
   Islands or Guam is also required (recent graduates are an exception -
   see below).

   What if I just graduated from pharmacy school and I don't have my
   pharmacy license yet?  May I still apply?

   Yes, you may.  If you have graduated from an American Council on
   Pharmaceutical Education (ACPE) accredited program within a year from
   your call-to-duty date, you may be appointed to the PHS Commissioned
   Corps for a limited tour of duty not to exceed 1 year.  Evidence of
   licensure is required for removal of the limitation and for retention
   in the Corps.

   How much will I earn?

   Compensation varies depending on factors such as grade/rank, years of
   training and experience in your profession,
   base pay entry date (BPED), geographic location of your duty station,
   and dependency status.  The minimum starting pay grade/rank for a
   pharmacist in the Commissioned Corps with a B.S. degree is O-2 (LTJG).
   The minimum starting pay grade/rank for a pharmacist with a Pharm.D.
   degree is O-3 (LT).  Pharmacy applicants  receive 5 years of training
   and experience (T & E) credit for the qualifying bachelor's degree.
   Applicants with a Pharm.D. degree as their first qualifying
   professional degree will be given 8 years of T & E credit.  Minimum
   credit for completing a combined B.S./Pharm.D. degree program is 8
   years.  Additional T & E credit may also be earned for time spent after
   receipt of the qualifying degree in degree-related activities.  This
   could be:
     * paid or volunteer employment
     * consultation or administration
     * college or university teaching
     * pharmaceutical industry practice
     * research

   officer's starting rank is calculated, click the section on the
   Training and Experience Date.

   What professional groups are available in the Commissioned Corps?

   You are encouraged to find out more about the Pharmacy Professional
   Advisory Committee (PharmPAC). The PharmPAC exists to provide advice
   and consultation to the Surgeon General on issues related to the
   professional practices and personnel activities of all PHS pharmacists.
   The PharmPAC also provides advisory assistance to the Chief Pharmacy
   Officer and to the agency and/or program heads where pharmacy officers
   work.  All members of the pharmacy category may express their concerns
   and voice their opinions through the PharmPAC.  The current members of
   the PharmPAC represent a cross-section of interests, professional
   experience and responsibilities.  The more pharmacists who contribute
   to PAC projects and activities, the more representative the products
   and policy recommendations will be.  If interested in joining, please
   contact the PharmPAC Chairperson, CAPT William Hess, at
   HESS@CDER.FDA.GOV  or (301) 827-3747.

   You are also encouraged to join the
   Commissioned Officers Association (COA), the only professional
   association specifically representing the PHS Commissioned Corps.  In
   addition to being a "voice on Capitol Hill,"  COA offers its members a
   range of services, including a strong professional network, financial
   services, and an annual scientific meeting.  The annual meeting,
   usually held in late spring, is an excellent opportunity to meet
   colleagues from other agencies/programs, to exchange scientific and
   career information, and to earn continuing education credits.  For
   membership information, please call (301) 731-9080 or visit COA's web
   site at www.coausphs.org.
