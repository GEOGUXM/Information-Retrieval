                                   Purpose

   The Corrosion Engineering Laboratory was officially established in 1985
   and outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment to conduct corrosion
   research and material evaluation in many different corrosive
   environments. In 2000 the laboratories became the Corrosion Technology
   Testbed.  The laboratory is continually upgraded as new instrumentation
   and techniques become available.

   Laboratory personnel provide independent, unbiased technical and
   scientific consultation on a wide range of advanced materials,
   corrosion control procedures, and protective coating issues.

                                Capabilities

   The KSC Corrosion Laboratories have complete capabilities for research,
   exposure testing, and analysis of steel, aluminum, and other structural
   materials under a wide variety of corrosive conditions.

                    Collage of Electrochemistry Equipment

   KSC personnel utilize test equipment such as salt spray chambers,
   weatherometers, ac and dc electrochemical corrosion instrumentation,
   adhesion testers, data loggers, and other instrumentation to conduct
   research on the corrosion behavior of materials in various
   environments. They provide design review and specification writing
   services for protective coating application, material selection, and
   cathodic protection for customers. Based upon their capabilities, they
   serve as principal investigators and technical managers in R&D programs
   on corrosion control.

   Current corrosion testing activities include compatibility of nickel
   alloys in oxidizing acid, corrosion testing of stainless steel in
   oxygen-deficient environment, and fracture of high strength low-alloy
   steels. Current protective coatings projects include conductive polymer
   coating research, silicone coating development, chromate conversion
   coating replacement, and inorganic zinc electrochemical work.

                               Accomplishments

   The lab and its work are considered unique within NASA. New procedures
   have been developed for rapidly evaluating corrosion-resistant alloys,
   protective coatings, and other materials, enhancing the safety and
   reliability of the nationâ€™s launch infrastructure and flight hardware.
   Much of the work accomplished within the lab has been presented at
   international conferences and published in technical journals, making
   KSC a major source of worldwide corrosion expertise.

   Many agencies such as the U. S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, other
   NASA centers, Lockheed Martin, EG&G, McDonnell-Douglas, Johnson
   Controls, Raytheon, Rockwell, USBI, Thiokol, and other private
   companies have consulted the laboratory on a wide variety of corrosion
   issues. Such issues include that of the deterioration of concrete
   structures in the marine environment for the Florida Department of
   Transportation.
