Motivation

   Atmospheric research increasingly is concerned with processes occurring
   aloft. It is in the mixed layer and free troposphere that most chemical
   reactions, gas-to-particle transformations, cloud processes, and long
   range transport of pollutants occurs. The Pacific Northwest National
   Laboratory operates a Grumman Gulfstream 1 aircraft as a U.S.
   Department of Energy Research Aircraft Facility to serve atmospheric
   scientists at DOE and other federal, state, and industrial laboratories
   in carrying out airborne research.

Applications

   The G-1 has participated in many field studies related to air quality,
   acid precipitation, and visibility:

     * Acid Model Operational and Diagnostic Evaluation Study. The
       National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program and the U.S.
       Environmental Protection Agency used the G-1 in 1988 and 1990 to
       collect air quality data over the northeastern United States for
       use in a multi-national evaluation of U.S. and Canadian acid rain
       models.
     * Frontal Boundary Study. In the last field study of the U.S.
       Department of Energy's Processing of Emissions by Clouds and
       Precipitation program, the G-1 collected air quality data in 1989
       to chemically characterize the air flowing into frontal storms.
     * Navajo Generating Station Visibility Study. The G-1 collected air
       quality, aerosol, and tracer data to assess the effects of the
       emissions from a power- generating station on visibility in the
       Grand Canyon in 1991.
     * Kuwait Oil-Fires Plume Study. Researchers used the G-1's aerosol
       and chemical sensors to measure the chemical and physical
       characteristics of smoke plumes from the Kuwait oil fires in 1991.
     * North Atlantic Regional Experiment. Scientists tested new
       measurement capabilities, studied the horizontal and vertical
       distribution of pollutants in a maritime environment, and
       characterized aerosol and cloud microphysical properties for the
       Department of Energy in 1992 and 1993.
     * Southern Oxidant Study Nashville/Middle Tennessee Valley Field
       Study. Researchers from several DOE laboratories used the G-1 to
       measure the vertical and regional distribution of ozone and its
       precursors to quantify the contribution of urban emissions to ozone
       production in 1994.
     * DOE Atmospheric Chemistry Program - Northeast Field Study.
       Scientists used the G-1 to test new chemical and aerosol
       instrumentation and measure distributions of ozone and its
       precursors in the growing boundary layer in the ozone transport
       region of the northeastern United States in 1994 and 1995.
     * Airborne Multisensor Pod System. The G-1 served as a test and
       development platform for the Air Concentrator Ion Trap Mass
       Spectrometer and the Real-Time Airborne Radionuclide Analyzer and
       Collector prior to their deployment in a pod for another aircraft
       in 1994.
     * DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurements Program. The G-1 was part of
       a multi-aircraft operation to support two cloud and aerosol
       intensive observation periods. Measurements of aerosol and cloud
       microphysics, radiative fluxes, and state parameters were made over
       the Southern Great Plains Cloud and Radiation Testbed site in
       Oklahoma in 1997.
