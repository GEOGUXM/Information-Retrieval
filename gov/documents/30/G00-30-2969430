     Dr. Ann F. Whitaker selected to head Science Directorate at NASA
     Marshall Center

     Dr. Ann F. Whitaker has been named director of the Science
     Directorate at NASAs Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,
     Ala., overseeing 700 civil servant and contractor employees who
     perform a wide array of science activities.

     Science affects every aspect of our lives, said Whitaker.  This
     research 혰 encompassing fields such as materials science,
     biotechnology, optics, Earth science and space science 혰 is needed
     to advance our nations technology across a broad spectrum.  Its
     exciting to be part of those activities.

     Whitaker has served as the Science Directorates deputy director
     since August 2000.

     A pioneer in developing methods for predicting the performance of
     materials in the space environment, Whitakers NASA career began in
     1963 when she joined the Marshall Center as a physicist in the
     former Propulsion and Vehicle Engineering Laboratory.

     Her early career included contributions to the Saturn program that
     launched Americans to the Moon, and the Long Duration Exposure
     Facility 혰 a series of flight experiments to characterize
     environmental effects in space.  Information gleaned from Whitakers
     early research continues to support material selection for
     present-day space systems, including the International Space
     Station.

     Whitaker became chief of Marshalls Physical Sciences Branch in 1977,
     chief of the Engineering Physics Division in 1984, and chief of the
     Project and Environmental Engineering Division in 1993.

     In 1995, she was selected for the Senior Executive Service, and held
     key leadership positions within Marshalls Science and Engineering
     Directorate. These included deputy director of the Space Sciences
     Laboratory and director of the Materials, Processes and
     Manufacturing Department.

      She has a bachelors degree in physics from Berry College in Rome,
     Ga., a masters degree in physics from the University of Alabama in
     Huntsville and a doctorate in materials engineering from Auburn
     University in Auburn, Ala.

     Whitaker has received numerous awards during her distinguished
     career, including NASAs Exceptional Service Medal, Exceptional
     Engineering Achievement Medal, Women in Science and Engineering
     Lifetime Achievement Award, and Rank of Meritorious Executive.  A
     resident of Huntsville, she and her husband, John Whitaker, are the
     parents of one daughter, Leann.

     The Marshall Center is NASA's lead center for development of space
     transportation and propulsion systems and advanced large optics
     manufacturing technology, as well as microgravity research 혰
     scientific research in the unique low-gravity environment inside the
     International Space Station and other spacecraft.
