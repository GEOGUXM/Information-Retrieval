   Summary

   In order to ensure that appropriate air traffic management technologies
   are considered in the environmental review process for the Runway
   Reconfiguration Project for San Francisco International Airport (SFO),
   the Airport and the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development
   Commission (BCDC) agreed to form an Independent Technology Panel to
   identify viable technological capacity enhancements that may meet or
   approach the purpose and need of the project, and to provide an
   independent assessment of the potential impact of new technologies on
   the capacity of SFO. The Technology Panel was asked to evaluate the
   viability of potential improvements in air traffic control technology,
   airspace allocation, and aircraft navigation, surveillance, or
   communications technologies and the extent to which, alone or in
   combination with other measures, they may increase the capacity of SFO
   to address two of the project needs:

     1. Reduce existing and projected flight delays

     2. Accommodate projected flight demand.

   It was agreed that the Technology Panel would focus on potential
   technologies to improve airfield capacity and/or reduce delays at SFO,
   and would recommend a suite of viable technological capacity
   enhancements to be included in the project alternatives (both build and
   no-build), as applicable. These recommendations would take into
   consideration the availability of technologies and their potential
   cumulative benefits to improve capacity or reduce delays at SFO.

   The Panel members consisted of Capt. William B. Cotton of Cotton
   Aviation Enterprises, Inc., Mount Prospect, Illinois, John Foggia of
   Aviation, Navigation, and Satellite Programs, Inc., Chicago, Illinois,
   and Dr. Geoffrey D. Gosling of the University of California at
   Berkeley.

   Issues to be Considered in Addressing the Potential Role of Technology

   The Panel gave particular attention to a number of important issues
   that need to be taken into account in any consideration of the
   potential role of future air traffic management technologies in
   enhancing the capacity of SFO. The first issue is the operational
   constraints that arise from the existing runway layout and the
   operational configurations that are required to be operated in various
   weather conditions. The Panel recognizes that any significant reduction
   in air traffic delays with the existing runway configuration will
   require the ability to operate arrival traffic to two closely spaced
   parallel runways under instrument flight conditions. This is currently
   not possible with existing instrument landing and air traffic control
   technology. In addition, the need to provide gaps in the arrival stream
   to release departures on crossing runways means that arriving aircraft
   will need to be paired close together, as they are currently under
   visual flight conditions.

   The Panel also considered a number of other issues that will affect the
   potential contribution of new technologies, including the time required
   to meet the certification and approval requirements, as well as install
   any necessary equipment on the aircraft fleet and train the flight
   crews in the new procedures, the need to obtain stakeholder buy-in, and
   the uncertainties that result from the complex interaction of all these
   factors.

   Review of Previous Studies

   The panel reviewed several previous studies that had been prepared for
   SFO, BCDC and others and that addressed the potential role of future
   air traffic management technologies at SFO, as well as a number of
   other relevant studies, including recent Federal Aviation
   Administration plans for the future evolution of the National Airspace
   System. While these studies identified most of the potential future air
   traffic management technologies that the Panel believes are applicable
   to SFO, the Panel found that the studies performed to date do not
   provide an adequate quantitative basis for assessing the future impact
   of these technologies on capacity and delays at SFO, and fail to
   clearly distinguish between the operational capabilities that will
   provide increased capacity and the enabling technologies that are
   required to implement these operational capabilities. In addition, many
   of the previous studies considered the various technologies in
   isolation and did not address how they could be combined to provide
   future operational capabilities that would enhance the capacity of SFO.

   Conclusions and Recommendations

   The Panel was asked to evaluate the prospects for air traffic
   management technology, airspace allocation, and aircraft navigation,
   control or communication technologies that could increase the capacity
   of SFO to reduce existing and projected flight delays and accommodate
   projected flight demand. The panel believes that technology related
   operational capabilities alone will not eliminate all existing and
   projected flight delays or fully accommodate long-term projected flight
   demand.

   The Panel has identified a number of future air traffic management
   technologies that will enable operational capabilities that can
   increase the arrival capacity of SFO during poor weather conditions,
   and recommends that the following operational capabilities and their
   associated enabling technologies be considered in the environmental
   review process:

     -- Precision Runway Monitor with a Simultaneous Offset Instrument
     Approach procedure

     -- Required Navigational Performance

     -- Paired Approach procedure based on the use of Automatic Dependent
     Surveillance Â– Broadcast (ADS-B) for aircraft separation

     -- Wake Vortex Advisory System

     -- Use of Center TRACON Automation System tools and ADS-B to
     increase the arrival capacity of a single runway.

   These operational capabilities vary with respect to both the likely
   capacity increase that they can provide and the timing when they are
   likely to be available. Those operational capabilities that will become
   available between now and 2005 appear likely to offer only modest
   increases in capacity with the existing runway configuration. As
   additional operational capabilities become available further in the
   future, they will enable larger increases in capacity. Furthermore,
   with several of these technologies, the increase in capacity that they
   provide depends on the extent to which aircraft are equipped to take
   advantage of them and flight crews are trained in and able to fly the
   necessary procedures. Therefore the capacity increase that they provide
   will initially be fairly small, and will increase over time as more
   aircraft are equipped and flight crews able to take advantage of the
   procedures.

   Even so, it does not appear that the operational capabilities that will
   become available between now and 2010 will close the gap between the
   good weather and poor weather capacity. At best, it appears that by
   2010 the arrival capacity of the existing runway configuration might be
   increased to about 45 aircraft per hour from the current 30 aircraft
   per hour. However, this will only be possible for some poor weather
   conditions. For other weather conditions, the increase will be much
   less. More advanced operational capabilities that could become
   available in the 2010 to 2015 time frame offer the potential to further
   increase the poor weather arrival capacity of the existing runway
   configuration under a wider range of poor weather conditions. By 2015,
   it may be possible to achieve an arrival rate to closely spaced
   parallel runways of as many as 60 aircraft per hour under most poor
   weather conditions.

   The operational capabilities and their associated enabling technologies
   that the Panel recommends be included in the environmental review of
   the Runway Reconfiguration Project differ for the No-Build and Build
   Alternatives. This distinction is not completely clean, since two Build
   Alternatives retain the closely spaced parallel runways in the
   north/south direction. Since arrivals on the Runway 19 pair during
   Southeast Plan operations only occur a small percentage of the time,
   consideration should be given to whether the costs of implementing an
   operational capability that allows simultaneous instrument arrivals to
   both Runway 19L and 19R for Alternatives A-3 or BX-2 are justified by
   the delay reduction benefits. This cannot be determined without a much
   more detailed analysis than has been performed to date or the Panel had
   the time or resources to undertake.

   The capacity benefits from any given set of technologies depends on
   both the traffic characteristics at the time and the extent to which
   the aircraft fleet is equipped to take advantage of them and the flight
   crews are trained in and comfortable with the necessary procedures.
   Therefore an adequate assessment of the likely increase in capacity
   from any particular set of operational capabilities in some future year
   will require a much more detailed analysis than the Panel has had
   either the time or the resources to perform. In order that the
   potential contribution of future air traffic management technologies
   can be properly addressed in the environmental review process, a
   quantitative assessment of both the likely capacity benefits of the
   various operational capabilities identified by the Panel and the
   associated uncertainties will need to be made. This assessment could be
   undertaken in parallel with other parts of the process and will need to
   consider the operational context within which the various technologies
   might be deployed as well as the extent to which the various
   technologies complement each other.

   The Panel believes that SFO is in a strong position to take an active
   leadership role in the deployment of new air traffic management
   technologies, and that such actions will make a big difference in how
   quickly potential future capabilities become available. The Panel
   recommends that SFO formally engage in a strategic technology
   initiative to accelerate the deployment of new air traffic management
   technologies. This would build on its current efforts to deploy
   PRM/SOIA and could be coordinated with similar efforts by other airport
   authorities.
