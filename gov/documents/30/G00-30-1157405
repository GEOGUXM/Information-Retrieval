   Information Systems Services

   The Management Information Systems (MIS) Department helps its customers
   gather, maintain, and use electronic data for a multitude of purposes.
   Specifically, MIS provides full service throughout the system life
   cycle, including business analysis, feasibility studies, systems
   analysis, design, programming, data conversion, training, deployment,
   and ongoing support of information systems. Services also include
   project management for application development projects and preparation
   of technical specifications related to acquisition of hardware and
   software for information systems.

   For more information about MIS services, contact the Information
   Systems Department office at 630-252-7156.
   Application Development
   Development and ongoing support of information systems is provided
   through a staff of 25 systems analysts and technical project managers
   with extensive experience in developing and maintaining all sizes of
   information systems. Laboratory and staff are supplemented with
   contractors as needed to meet peak requirements, with Argonne staff
   playing key roles on the development team so MIS is able to provide
   in-house support for the new system once it is in use.

   Database Services
   Specialized database services are provided for those Argonne programs
   that require only database design and database administration services.
   Database design, tuning, performance monitoring, backup, recovery,
   release upgrades, data conversions, and troubleshooting are available
   for small to very large databases. Assistance is also available in
   preparing database-related elements of proposals.

   Information Report Services
   As a supplement to standard reports available through the Laboratory's
   business systems, ECT staff can provide custom reports for anyone who
   has been granted access to a particular system. In addition to reports,
   electronic files can also be created and downloaded for use with Excel,
   MS Access, or other tools on the customer's desktop.

   Operations
   Operations services are available for production systems and
   applications. These services are based on best practices that ECT has
   developed while operating data centers for the Argonne business
   systems. Operations services include operating system upgrades and
   patches, configuration management, software and hardware license
   management, off-hours production job monitoring, notification services
   for failed jobs, tape handling, high-volume printing, output
   distribution, and other operations-related support activities.
