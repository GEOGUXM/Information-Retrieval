   analyzing data, drawing conclusions a nd reporting their results. This
   scientific process allows others to build on their findings. GLOBE

   THE RIVER CLAMOR AND ITS INFLUENCE IN TH THE RIVER CLAMOR AND ITS
   INFLUENCE IN TH by Escuer Anna, Martín Guillermo, Navarro Carlos, Ortiz
   Inés, Valenciano José, Zuriguel Leyre
   IES "Ramón J. Sender"
   Rivers water quality has become a decisive element in recovering rivers
   as natural spaces, which may be used and enjoyed by people.
   Unfortunately, in the latest parts of river Cinca there is an organic
   matheria contamination problem, possibly caused by wastes in river
   Clamor. The appearence of river Cinca downstream river Clamor is
   different from the one upstream. The main objective of this project is
   the investigation of this question, using GLOBE hidrology protocols and
   comparing them with the ones that Hidrographic Confederation of the
   Ebro basin (C.H.E.) has been doing for 20 years.
