   [go_up_btn.gif]    Conservation Farm Option (CFO)

   The Conservation Farm Option is a pilot program for producers of wheat,
   feed grains, cotton, and rice. The program's purposes include
   conservation of soil, water, and related resources, water quality
   protection and improvement, wetland restoration, protection and
   creation, wildlife habitat development and protection, or other similar
   conservation purposes. Eligibility is limited to owners and producers
   who have contract acreage enrolled in the Agricultural Market
   Transition Act program, i.e. production flexibility contracts. The CFO
   is a voluntary program. Participants are required to develop and
   implement a conservation farm plan. The plan becomes part of the CFO
   contract which covers a ten year period. CFO is not restricted as to
   what measures may be included in the conservation plan, so long as they
   provide environmental benefits. During the contract period the owner or
   producer (1.) receives annual payments for implementing the CFO
   contract and (2.) agrees to forgo payments under the Conservation
   Reserve Program, the Wetlands Reserve Program, and the Environmental
   Quality Incentives Program in exchange for one consolidated payment.

   [go_up_btn.gif]    Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)

   The four primary goals of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) are to
   reduce erosion, improve water quality, enhance wildlife and improve air
   quality. CRP is administered by the Farm Service Agency, a conservation
   partner of NRCS; however, NRCS provides technical assistance and some
   promotional assistance to the program. CRP is a voluntary program in
   which farmers and ranchers enter into 10- to 15-year contracts with
   USDA to take highly erodible land and other environmentally sensitive
   cropland out of production by applying protective vegetative cover best
   suited for wildlife. In exchange, landowners receive annual rental
   payments for the land and cost-share assistance for establishing
   conservation practices. The program protects the nation's most
   environmentally sensitive cropland.

   The CRP is by far the most popular conservation program in the state.
   The continuous sign-up 19, opened October 1, 1998. Through the 18th
   sign-up, which ended December 11, 1998, North Dakota had 9,278 offers
   on 1,036,753 acres. North Dakota was first in the nation. Final sign-up
   figures and notification of acceptance of offers will be released
   later. If all the acres offered in North Dakota are accepted, there
   would be 4.2 million acres of land in the state idled under the
   program. But contracts on about 560,000 acres in North Dakota will
   expire on September 30, 1999.

   The Environmental Benefits Index (EBI), which ranks CRP offers based on
   six environmental factors and a cost factor, was changed for CRP
   sign-up 16 to address air quality, wildlife benefits, and to reflect
   the diversity of the land offered for CRP.

   [go_up_btn.gif]    Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA)

   The purpose of the program is to assist land-users, communities, units
   of state and local government, and other Federal agencies in planning
   and implementing conservation systems. The purpose of the conservation
   systems are to reduce erosion, improve soil and water quality, improve
   and conserve wetlands, enhance fish and wildlife habitat, improve air
   quality, improve pasture and range condition, reduce upstream flooding,
   and improve woodlands.

   Objectives of the program are to:
     * Assist individual landusers, communities, conservation districts,
       and other units of State and local government and Federal agencies
       to meet their goals for resource stewardship and assist individuals
       to comply with State and local requirements. NRCS assistance to
       individuals is provided through conservation districts in
       accordance with the memorandum of understanding signed by the
       Secretary of Agriculture, the governor of the state, and the
       conservation district. Assistance is provided to land users
       voluntarily applying conservation and to those who must comply with
       local or State laws and regulations.
     * Assist agricultural producers to comply with the highly erodible
       land (HEL) and wetland (Swampbuster) provisions of the 1985 Food
       Security Act as amended by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and
       Trade Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 3801 et. seq.) and the Federal
       Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 and wetlands
       requirements of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. NRCS makes HEL
       and wetland determinations and helps land users develop and
       implement conservation plans to comply with the law.
     * Provide technical assistance to participants in USDA cost-share and
       conservation incentive programs. (Assistance is funded on a
       reimbursable basis from the CCC.)
     * Collect, analyze, interpret, display, and disseminate information
       about the condition and trends of the Nations soil and other
       natural resources so that people can make good decisions about
       resource use and about public policies for resource conservation.
     * Develop effective science-based technologies for natural resource
       assessment, management, and conservation.

   [go_up_btn.gif]    Emergency Conservation Program (ECP)

   The Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) provides financial assistance
   to farmers and ranchers for the restoration of farmlands on which
   normal farming operations have been impeded by natural disasters.  ECP
   also helps with funds for carrying out emergency water conservation
   measures during periods of severe drought.  Emergency conservation
   assistance is available for removing debris and restoring permanent
   fences, terraces, diversions, irrigation systems, and other
   conservation installations.  Conservation problems that existed before
   a disaster are not eligible.

   [go_up_btn.gif]    Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP)

   The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) is a voluntary
   conservation program which offers farmers and ranchers a tool to
   address their natural resource concerns while achieving the most
   environmental benefits through locally developed priority areas and
   natural resource concerns.

   Eligibility for the program is limited to persons who are engaged in
   livestock or agricultural production. EQIP provides cost-share
   assistance for up to 75 percent of certain conservation practices.
   Incentive payments can be offered to encourage producers to perform
   land management practices. Total cost-share and incentive payments are
   limited to $10,000 per person per year and $50,000 for the length of
   the contract, which can run from 5 to 10 years.

   For 1999, North Dakota received an EQIP funding allocation of
   $3,000,000 for financial assistance and educational assistance. This is
   a decrease from 1998 in which North Dakota received an allocation of
   $3,628,000 to focus on fifteen geographic priority areas and four
   statewide resource concerns, and 1997's figures of $4.2 million for
   nine geographic priority areas and four statewide resource concerns.

   The 1999 allocation covers 19 geographic priority areas which have been
   identified across the state. They are Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa,
   Spirit Lake Sioux, Standing Rock, Fort Berthold, Missouri Coteau, North
   West Coteau, Heart River, Devils Lake Basin, Sheyenne River Basin,
   Riparian Forest, Beaver Creek, Antelope Creek, Cedar Lake Watershed,
   Thirty Mile Creek, Otter Creek, West Des Lacs Souris, Adams County/Duck
   Creek, Pipestem Creek Watershed, and Lower North Fork Grand River. The
   four natural resource concerns that blanket the state include grazing
   lands, concentrated livestock waste, windbreaks, and soil health.

   Application to participate in EQIP can be made throughout the year. For
   1999, two periods have been established to evaluate participant
   applications and award contracts. The first evaluation period is
   scheduled for March 1 through March 23. The second is for May 3 through
   May 28. Those producers who may not quite have their conservation plans
   developed by the end of the first evaluation period or did not receive
   an offer for a contract will have an opportunity to compete in the
   second period.

   [go_up_btn.gif]    Emergency Watershed Protection Program (EWP)
   Floodplain Easement

   Through the Emergency Watershed Protection Program (EWP), the Natural
   Resources Conservation Service is authorized to purchase floodplain
   easements on lands that have serious recurring flooding problems.  The
   EWP Program is designed to reduce threats to life and property in the
   wake of natural disasters such as floods and fires.  Technical and
   financial assistance is provided to landowners to treat land within
   watersheds.  NRCS undertakes emergency measures to retard runoff and
   reduce soil erosion and sedimentation.  Assistance includes both
   removing and establishing vegetative cover; controlling gullies;
   installing streambank protection devices; removing debris and sediment;
   and stabilizing levees, channels and gullies.  In subsequent storms,
   EWP projects protect homes from further damage.

   The primary purpose of the pilot floodplain easement is to provide
   landowners and the public an alternative to restoring frequently
   flood-damaged lands to agricultural production through the use of
   public funds.  And, they provide an opportunity to accrue long-term
   economic, social, and environmental benefits.

   In Fiscal Year 1998, $3,000,000 was funded for 32 easements.  In Fiscal
   Year 1999, another $2,000,000 was appropriated to North Dakota.
   Currently, there are 34 easements being appraised and reviewed in order
   to obligate these fund.

   [go_up_btn.gif]    Forestry Incentives Program (FIP)

   The Forestry Incentives Program (FIP) supports good forest management
   practices on privately owned, non-industrial forest lands nationwide.
   FIP is designed to benefit the environment while meeting future demands
   for wood products. Eligible practices are tree planting, timber stand
   improvement, site preparation for natural regeneration, and other
   related activities. FIP is available in counties designated by a Forest
   Service survey of eligible private timber acreage.

   [go_up_btn.gif]    Farmland Protection Program (FPP)

   The Farmland Protection Program  (FPP) is a voluntary program that
   helps farmers keep their land in agriculture.  The program provides
   funding to State, local or tribal entities with existing farmland
   protection programs to purchase conservation easements or other
   interests.  The goal of the program is to protect between 170,000 and
   340,000 acres of farmland.  The Natural Resources Conservation Service
   has been designated as the lead agency in implementing this program.

   The Farmland Protection Program is currently not available in North
   Dakota.

   [go_up_btn.gif]    Conservation of Private Grazing Lands

   The Conservation of Private Grazing Lands initiative will ensure that
   technical, education, and related assistance is proved to those who own
   private grazing lands.  It is not a cost-share program.  Advanced
   technology and timely technical assistance to producers are crucial to
   meeting the resource needs associated with private grazing lands, while
   achieving environmental, economic, and social benefits for both rural
   and urban citizens.  Technical assistance on grazing lands has been
   provided through various NRCS programs, including the Great Plains
   Conservation Program and Environmental Quality Incentives Program.
   State strategies have been developed to complement the national Grazing
   Lands Conservation Initiative (GLCI).  The North Dakota Private Grazing
   Lands Coalition evolved through capacity building among NRCS
   partnerships under the GLCI.  The Coalition is now represented on the
   State Technical Committee, supporting statewide grazing lands issues.

   [go_up_btn.gif]    Resource Conservation & Development Program (RC&D)

   The purpose of the Resource Conservation and Development (RC&D) program
   is to accelerate the conservation, development and utilization of
   natural resources, improve the general level of economic activity, and
   to enhance the environment and standard of living in authorized RC&D
   areas. It improves the capability of State, tribal and local units of
   government and local nonprofit organizations in rural areas to plan,
   develop and carry out programs for resource conservation and
   development.

   There are eight funded RC&D areas that encompass all 53 counties in
   North Dakota.  They are Upper Dakota, Northern Plains, Red River, Lake
   Agassiz, South Central, Dakota Prairies, Dakota West, and Williston
   Basin.  Project measures and associated measures such as water quality
   projects, inventories, feasibility studies, educational projects
   critical area treatment projects, water supply, residue management,
   recreation, fire protection, health, and a host of other measures were
   developed this past fiscal year.

   [go_up_btn.gif]    Small Watershed Program - PL-566

   The Small Watershed Program works through local government sponsors and
   helps participants solve natural resource and related economic problems
   on a watershed basis. Projects include watershed protection, flood
   prevention, erosion and sediment control, water supply, water quality,
   fish and wildlife habitat enhancement, wetlands creation and
   restoration, and public recreation in watersheds of 250,000 or fewer
   acres. Both technical and financial assistance are available.

   For more information, e-mail wes.wiedenmeyer@nd.usda.gov

   Also see the Emergency Watershed Protection Fact Sheet.

   [go_up_btn.gif]    Soil Survey Programs

   The National Cooperative Soil Survey Program (NCSS) is a partnership
   led by NRCS of Federal land management agencies, state agricultural
   experiment stations and state and local units of government that
   provide soil survey information necessary for understanding, managing,
   conserving and sustaining the nation's limited soil resources.

   Soil surveys provide an orderly, on-the-ground, scientific inventory of
   soil resources that includes maps showing the locations and extent of
   soils, data about the physical and chemical properties of those soils,
   and information derived from that data about potentialities and
   problems of use on each kind of soil in sufficient detail to meet all
   reasonable needs for farmers, agricultural technicians, community
   planners, engineers, and scientists in planning and transferring the
   findings of research and experience to specific land areas.

   Currently, modern published soil surveys are available in 42 of the 53
   counties in North Dakota.   Modern soil surveys have been in existence
   since 1964.  For Fiscal Year 1998, the focus was on McKenzie County
   which has an anticipated completion date of September 1999.  This will
   complete the once-over survey for the state.

   [go_up_btn.gif]    Stewardship Incentives Program (SIP)

   The Stewardship Incentive Program provides technical and financial
   assistance to encourage non-industrial private forest landowners to
   keep their lands and natural resources productive and healthy.
   Qualifying land includes rural lands with existing tree cover or land
   suitable for growing trees and which is owned by a private individual,
   group, association, corporation, Indian tribe, or other legal private
   entity. Eligible landowners must have an approved Forest Stewardship
   Plan and own 1,000 or fewer acres of qualifying land. Authorizations
   may be obtained for exceptions of up to 5,000 acres.

   For more information, e-mail craig.stange@nd.usda.gov

   [go_up_btn.gif]    Third Party Certification

   NRCS provides conservation planning and technical assistance to
   agricultural producers and others who make natural resource management
   decisions.  Third party vendors are qualified individuals who also
   offer this type of assistance.  Producers are not required to use third
   party vendors, but have this option for help with their conservation
   plans.

   Authorized in the 1996 Farm Bill, third party vendors are individuals
   who are appropriately certified through a recognized certification
   organization.  Certifying organizations can be in both the private and
   public sectors.

   Private consultants, employees of agribusiness, and others who have
   been certified through an approved independent certification
   organization or a state licensing agency can be approved as a third
   party vendor.   Employees of natural resource conservation agencies,
   departments, or other entities organized under local, State, or Federal
   law who provide planning and technical assistance as part of their jobs
   also can be approved as third party vendors.  Other non-commercial
   sources, as determined by NRCS state conservationists, may also be
   approved.

   [go_up_btn.gif]    Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program

   The Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) is designed to increase
   habitat primarily on private lands for upland wildlife, wetland
   wildlife, threatened and endangered species, fish, and other wildlife.
   In North Dakota, emphasis has been placed on cost-share payments for
   wildlife practices not normally cost-shared under USDA programs
   including:
     * Winter habitat, large woody block plantings statewide.
     * Aspen management in Bottineau, Benson, Cavalier, Dunn, McHenry,
       McKenzie, Pembina, Pierce, Rolette, Towner and Walsh Counties.

   A partnership with the ND Game and Fish Department, ND Forest Service,
   Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, Pheasants Forever, and the US Fish and
   Wildlife Service has been developed to deliver the program to
   interested landowners.

   North Dakota received an allocation of $284,000 for Fiscal Year 1998.
   Funds this year were sufficient to meet the demands of anyone who
   applied.   Twenty-seven contracts in the amount of $86,523 were awarded
   for aspen management and 47 contracts in the amount of $189,259 for
   woody block plantings.  It is anticipated that as more learn about the
   program, interest will increase.  Currently, WHIP is not funded beyond
   Fiscal Year 1999.

   [go_up_btn.gif]    Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP)

   The Wetlands Reserve Program  (WRP) is an NRCS conservation easement
   and
   cost-share program which allows landowners to restore wetlands on
   non-federal land.  This voluntary program provides an opportunity for
   landowners to receive financial incentives to enhance wetlands in
   exchange for retiring marginal agricultural land.  The wetlands are
   protected by placing them in 30-year easements or in 10-year cost-share
   only contracts.  To date, North Dakota has allocated money for
   thirty-two easements and fourteen cost-share contracts. Contract
   funding totals over $3,220,000 on approximately 6154 acres for 30-year
   easements and 1730 acres for 10-year easements.

   NRCS is partnering with the ND Department of Agriculture to restore
   wetlands entered into the State Water Bank Program.  The landowner will
   receive rental payments through the ND Department of Agriculture.  NRCS
   is providing assistance in ranking and subsequent planning of Water
   Bank agreements, and also financial assistance to the Water Bank
   Program for herbaceous cover planting and wetland restoration through
   the 10-year restoration portion of the WRP.
