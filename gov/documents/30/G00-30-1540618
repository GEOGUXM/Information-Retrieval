[pp_icon.gif] Groundwater Data Retrieval by Season
     __________________________________________________________________

   This page provides access to groundwater level data for all wells in a
   basin for a discrete time period. Queries are based on your input.

   First, select a season for data retrieval, either Spring or Fall. For
   these retrievals, "Spring" covers the period from January through June,
   "Fall" covers the period from July through December. Next, choose a
   year for your retrieval. Then, choose one basin from the list. Finally,
   press the "Get Data" button at the bottom of the page.

   If you're interested in only data for a single well or a few wells, use
   our historical data query form.
