   The Payload Operations Center at the Marshall Space Flight Center in
   Huntsville, Ala., provides the heartbeat for International Space
   Station science operations. This science command post will link
   Earth-bound researchers around the world with their experiments and
   astronauts aboard the International Space Station.

   Throughout the life of the Space Station, the operations center will
   integrate research requirements, plan its science missions, and ensure
   that they are safely executed. It will integrate crew and ground team
   training and research mission timelines. It will manage use of space
   station payload resources, handle science communications with the crew,
   and manage commanding and data transmissions to and from the orbiting
   research center.

   The Operations Center will be staffed around the clock by three shifts
   of 13 to 19 flight controllers.
