   Request for Neuroprotective Agents for Parkinson's Disease in
   NINDS-sponsored Clinical Trial
   Friday, August 24, 2001
   The NINDS is undertaking a major research initiative to establish
   efficacious therapies to slow the progression of Parkinson's disease, a
   cause of chronic neurologic disability affecting more than a million
   Americans. Recommendations for neuroprotective drugs for testing in a
   large clinical trial are sought. Ideas and recommendations are being
   widely solicited from experts working in Parkinson's disease, academic
   and pharmaceutical industry-based, as well as from patient advocate
   groups. This information will be collated and presented to the
   Oversight Committee. For more information, please go to Request for
   Neuroprotective Agents.
