   The OCC respects your privacy. We do not collect or store information
   about members of the public who call or write the agency or visit our
   Web site, unless you identify yourself so that we can respond to an
   inquiry or request from you.

   We do, however, collect and store information about your Internet
   connection when you visit our Web site to read or download information,
   such as our bulletins, alerts or press releases. We use this
   information to help us stay abreast of technical upgrades that can make
   our site more accessible to visitors, and to record the date and time
   of your visit to our site.

   If you identify yourself when you contact us, various people may see
   your information. We adhere to the following principles in handling
   information you provide:
     * We use your personally identifying information only for the purpose
       for which it is originally collected.
     * We maintain your personally identifying information in secure
       computer systems and we limit employee access to those with a
       business reason to see it.
     * We do not disclose your information to anyone outside the OCC,
       except where compelled by law or in connection with a criminal
       investigation (as explained below).

   To understand in greater detail how we handle your Internet connection
   and personal identification information, read the sections below.
     __________________________________________________________________

   When visiting the OCC Web site:If you visit our site to read or
   download information, we do not collect information about you, but we
   do collect and store information about your Internet connection and the
   date and time of your visit. Specifically, we record:
     * The name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for
       example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online
       account, or princeton.edu, if you are connecting from Princeton
       University's domain).
     * The Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly
       to our site, if any (for example, www.fdic.gov, if you are
       following a link from the FDIC Web site, or www.yahoo.com, if you
       find us using the Yahoo search engine).
     * The type of web browsing software you are using to view our site.
     * The date and time you access our site.

   When calling or sending postal or electronic mail: You may choose to
   tell us your name and address or other identifying information when,
   for example, you make an inquiry or comment that requires further
   correspondence, request that your name or organization be added to an
   OCC mailing list or database, or submit a complaint.
     * If you make an inquiry or request to be added to a mailing list, we
       enter your information into one of our electronic databases that
       are used for mailing lists and for tracking correspondence.
     * If you respond to a request for public comments on proposed
       rulemakings, policy statements or other regulatory actions, a copy
       of your comment letter is placed in the public file and is
       available to the general public.

   If you are sending electronic mail to the OCC, we want to remind you
   that e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. If your
   information is very sensitive, or includes personal or confidential
   information -- such as your bank account, charge card, or social
   security number -- you may want to send it by postal mail to one of the
   addresses listed below.

   When making an inquiry, request or complaint that requires follow-up:
   If you are making an inquiry or request or filing a complaint that
   warrants supervisory or other attention, we may need to share your
   information with others.
     * We may need to bring your correspondence to the attention of our
       attorneys, examiners, or other appropriate staff.

     * If necessary to address the issue, we may need to share your
       correspondence with other federal, state, or local agencies
       responsible for administrating or enforcing laws, rules, or
       regulations or for investigating known or suspected violations of
       laws, rules, or regulations, such as the Justice Department or
       state bank regulators.
     * Under limited circumstances, such as a request from Congress or a
       private individual acting with appropriate legal authority, we may
       be required by law to disclose information you submit.
     * If you file a complaint about a national bank or its affiliate, we
       typically provide your customer identification information along
       with the complaint to the affected bank. This information is
       usually necessary for the bank to be able to investigate and
       correct a problem. In turn, a bank sometimes provides the OCC
       additional information about you when it responds to our inquiry.
       All of this information is securely retained in OCC records.

   If you do not want your identity disclosed to the bank, it may be
   difficult to resolve your problem, but we will make every effort to
   assist you. Please state this clearly in your complaint, and submit
   your complaint to us in writing.
