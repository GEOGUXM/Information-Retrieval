   Plans are described in the final 4(d) rules issued by the NMFS, as a
   mechanism for applying 4(d) rule limits to resource management plans
   developed jointly by the States and the Tribes under the jurisdiction
   of United States v. Washington or United States v. Oregon. Such a plan
   would be developed and reviewed under the government-to-government
   processes outlined in the final 4(d) rule for Tribal Resource
   Management Plans. Joint Resource Management Plans will be evaluated
   against the criteria of Limits 4 (Fishery Activities) and 5 (Artificial
   Propagation). Before any Joint Plan receives a limit on the take
   prohibitions, the Secretary must, after taking into account any public
   comment on NMFS' evaluation of the Plan, determine that it will not
   appreciably reduce the likelihood of the listed species' survival and
   recovery.

   Specific guidance on how to use Joint Resource Management Plans to
   qualify for limitation of take prohibitions under section 4(d),
   including how to apply, whether 4(d) is the most appropriate route for
   your Plan, and what other mechanisms are available for addressing
   fisheries under the Endangered Species Act, can be found in the
   pertinent sections of the Northwest Region's Citizen's Guide and
   Implementation Binder.
