  The techniques in the following list can be used for the detection of
  inhomogeneities in materials caused by porosity, grain orientation or grain
  size. Click on the titles of any technique for further information.

                              Ultrasonics (UT)

                                General Uses:

     * Ultrasonics is ideal for the detection of cracks, voids and
       inclusions.
     * Detection of density variations on the order 0.25% or less.
     * Samples which require resolution as small as 2 microns in three
       dimensions.
     * Samples can be inspected for both surface characteristics as well
       as bulk characteristics.

                          Examples of Applications:

     * Examining bolts or rivets in aircraft wings to find cracks and
       defects.
     * Inspection of carbon composites for aging or impact damage.
     * Weld penetration inspection.
     * Stockpile surveilance.

                                Test Samples:

    UT can be applied to metal componets as well as carbon composites and
     ceramics. It is best if the samples are flat, or have spherical or
                            cylindrical symmetry.

                                Limitations:

    Sound waves can be attenuated rapidly in certain materials making it
   difficult to perform Pulse/Echo measurements on thick (more than a few
   inches) parts. A high resolution scan of large parts and scans of parts
         with odd shapes or convoluted surfaces can take many hours.
