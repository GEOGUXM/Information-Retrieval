HISTORICAL BATHYMETRIC CHANGE ANALYSIS

   As described in our METHODS section, a continuous surface
   representation of each bathymetric survey was created using
   Topogrid--an Arc/Info module that utilizes sounding and contour
   information to create a hydrodynamically correct surface. Input data
   was a combination of point soundings and hand-drawn depth contours (see
   table below). Once a bathymetric surface has been created for each
   hydrographic survey the surfaces are adjusted to a common datum and we
   compute change or difference grids. These new change surfaces
   identify areas of erosion and deposition.

   Here is an example difference map of San Pablo Bay (1856-1887). During
   this period there was massive sediment accumulation related to
   hydraulic gold mining.

   The data supporting historical change analysis is quite extensive. The
   following tables summarize the survey dates, digitized soundings, and
   contours used to produce the bathymetric surfaces and difference maps
   for Northern San Francisco Bay.

   ANIMATIONS OF CHANGE FOR NORTH BAY

      By linear interpolation, we can compute sedimentation maps for years
      between surveys and combine the maps to produce an animation of
      sedimentation for the North Bay. Click here to view the animation (1.5
      MB animated GIF). This animation gives an overall view of the system in
      time and space. We can see that, in the more active channels of Suisun
      Bay, surface sediment is deposited and erodes quickly in response to
      changing flows (floods/drought) and modifications (such as dredging the
      southern channel or long term mooring of the mothball fleet).

      We assume:
       1. the sediment deposited in North San Francisco Bay between 1856 and
          1887 was dominated by hydraulic mining debris;
       2. erosion observed in subsequent surveys was not re-deposited
          locally; and
       3. material deposited after 1887 was not mining debris.

      Making these assumptions, we can predict the location and thickness of
      the original hydraulic mining debris. It is especially notable that the
      mercury employed in gold mining in the Sierra Nevada was refined liquid
      quicksilver or elemental mercury; this is a form of mercury much more
      likely to foster net methylation than is cinnabar, the form of mercury
      in most mercury mines. Approximately 10,000 tonnes of refined mercury
      were lost to the watershed during the Gold Rush mining era. Much of the
      mercury consumed by gold mining could have been incorporated into the
      12 billion cubic meters of sediments extracted by the mining activities
      and released to the rivers of the Bay-Delta watershed. The
      mercury-laced hydraulic mining debris was ultimately transported to the
      bay-delta; it is known that large deposits of hydraulic mining debris
      remain in bay sediments. These wastes formed marshes, islands, or
      filled or diked marsh, or were deposited in shallow waters. Under the
      right circumstances this mercury contamination is transported through
      the food chain and concentrated in some commercial and sport fish.
      Human consumption of fish caught in the Bay is already restricted
      because of mercury contamination. Specifically, adults are advised to
      limit consumption of sport fish from the Bay to two times a month;
      pregnant or nursing women and children 6 or under should limit
      consumption to one time a month. Large shark and striped bass from the
      Bay should not be consumed at all. As we study the feasibility of
      restoration of marshes that were sinks for mining debris, the
      possibility of releasing mercury to the Bay must be considered.
