   Heating Oil Insurance

   The Heating Oil Pollution Liability Insurance Program became effective
   in 1996 because of the recognition that liability for contamination
   resulting from a heating oil tank spill or leak can pose a serious
   potential financial hardship for homeowners and other heating oil
   users.

   truck picture Tanks containing heating oil for consumptive use on the
   premises are not subject to the regulations of the EPA or Ecology
   regarding financial responsibility for the cost of cleanup of
   contamination resulting from a spill or leak. The lack of regulation of
   tanks, however, provides no relief from the potential liability
   associated with their operation.

   Recognizing the problem, heating oil dealers of the state crafted a
   program by which they have imposed a fee on themselves in order to
   provide pollution liability insurance coverage for every registered
   active heating oil tank in the state.

   The Pollution Liability Insurance Agency (PLIA) is the representative
   of the insurance company providing coverage and administers the Heating
   Oil Pollution Liability Insurance Program.

   All liabilities caused by an accidental release originating from a
   heating oil tank are the sole responsibility of the heating oil tank
   owner. PLIA and/or the state of Washington accepts no liability, nor
   portion of liability, from the heating oil tank owner.
