   SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS

   Acquisition Services provides a full-range of simplified acquisition
   award services including the award, administration, and close-out of
   purchase orders, federal supply schedule delivery orders, Blanket
   Purchase Agreements, and Government purchase card orders. We provide
   the full range of award services including acquisition planning
   (developing an acquisition strategy that provides the most efficient
   and effective method for procuring the customers requirements),
   developing the request for quote and related contractual documentation,
   receiving/analyzing quotes, and awarding the contractual documents. We
   work closely with our customers and emphasize open communication
   throughout the acquisition process in order to be responsive to
   customer needs and ensure customer satisfaction.

   We operate in an environment that stresses innovation and streamlining
   as envisioned by the National Performance Review. For example, we
   participate fully in the Federal Acquisition Computer Network (FACNET)
   process. We participate in the DOT Reinvention Lab which provides a
   mechanism to streamline the acquisition process by waiving rules and
   providing a forum for review of all Departmental regulations for
   possible deletion. The Lab has created an environment that supports
   innovation and progressive thinking which equates to a savings in time
   and dollars.

   The Acquisition Services staff is highly motivated and consistently
   strives to be a catalyst of change. The staff has experience in
   providing simplified acquisition services for a wide range of
   supplies/services including economic and management analyses, national
   and international transportation studies and related topics,
   Information Technology supplies/services (e.g., hardware, software,
   programming, networking, database management, equipment maintenance),
   training services, temporary personnel services, investigation support
   services, and graphic support services. In the past two fiscal years
   Acquisition Services has awarded approximately 2,000 actions totaling
   approximately $20,000,000.

   Acquisition Services has created an equitable and competitive fee
   structure for performing contract award services for its customers.
