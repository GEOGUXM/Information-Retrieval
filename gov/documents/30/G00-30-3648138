   Why be a HUD contractor?
   Working with HUD offers new opportunities to use your know-how, develop
   and expand new markets, and help upgrade the nation's housing supply!
   We make sure that a fair portion of our contracts go to small or small
   disadvantaged businesses and women-owned small businesses. This policy
   helps promote economic growth for our nation, since small businesses
   generate the majority of new jobs.

   Note: Every new contract solicitation expected to exceed $25,000 is
   posted to our current contracting opportunities page. This way, you can
   browse the current solicitations and download any of the complete
   solicitations you choose. We also have a list of those HUD prime
   contractors that might offer subcontracting opportunities. We think
   this is a faster, less costly way to tell you about our opportunities.
   It also lets you decide which contracts you wish to compete for and
   reduces the risk of your missing out on any competition.
