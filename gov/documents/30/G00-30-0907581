                           OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES

               In the Office of Administrative Law Judges (ALJ), Judges are
         appointed by the Authority under section 7105(d) of the Statute. The
         Judges perform a variety of functions related primarily to conducting
         hearings and rendering recommended decisions in cases involving alleged
         unfair labor practices. In addition, the Judges render decisions
         involving applications for attorney fees filed under the Back Pay Act
         and the Equal Access to Justice Act and take other actions as directed
         by the Authority.

               The Office of Administrative Law Judges is staffed with five
         Judges, a Director of the Settlement Judge Program (ADR), and a support
         staff.

               Inquiries concerning the Office of Administrative Law Judges,
         including the Settlement Judge Program should be directed to:

         Eli Nash

         Part 2423, Subparts B, C and D of the Authority's Regulations,
   should be consulted for authoritative guidance on processing cases
   before an Administrative Law Judge. Those processes are described
   briefly here.

  Pre-hearing procedures

         After an Unfair Labor Practice complaint and notice of hearing is
   issued by a Regional Director, and an answer to the complaint is filed,
   a Judge conducts a pre-hearing conference. The conference is held at
   least 7 days prior to the hearing date. The conference is designed to:
   discuss, narrow and resolve issues raised in the complaint and the
   answer to the complaint; enter into settlement discussions; address
   outstanding motions; agree to stipulations of fact; and discuss
   subpoena requests. All parties are required to participate in the
   pre-hearing conference.

  Stipulated Records and Motions for Summary Judgment

         When all parties to a case agree that no material issue of fact
   exists, the parties may jointly submit a motion to the Judge or to the
   Authority to consider the case based on a stipulation of fact. When
   submitted to the Judge, the Judge may grant the motion and decide the
   case through stipulation. In certain circumstances, the Authority may
   grant the motion and decide the case. In either event, no hearing is
   held.

         Any party can move for summary judgment if the party can
   demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that
   the party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Motions must be
   filed at least 10 days prior to the start of the hearing. If all issues
   are decided by summary judgment, no hearing is held and the Judge
   prepares a written decision.

  Hearing and Post-hearing Procedures

         Hearings are conducted in a fair, impartial and judicial manner
   and in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act. All parties
   are afforded due process of law, which includes the right to appear in
   person or by counsel, to examine and cross-examine witnesses and to
   introduce evidence. The General Counsel has the burden of proving the
   allegations of the complaint by a preponderance of the evidence. The
   Respondent has the burden of proving any affirmative defenses that it
   raises. Settlement discussions are encouraged and may be held even
   after the opening of the hearing.

  Issuance of a Recommended Decision

         At the discretion of the Judge, and on joint motion of the
   parties, the Judge may issue a bench decision at the close of a
   hearing. In so doing, the parties waive their right to file a
   post-hearing brief. Written material, including excerpts from the
   transcript, together with any supplementary material the Judge deems
   necessary to complete the decision, is transmitted to the Authority and
   furnished to the parties. In all other cases, the Judge prepares a
   written decision. The decision sets forth: the statement of the issues;
   relevant findings of fact; conclusions of law, and reasons therefor;
   credibility determinations if necessary; and a recommended disposition
   or order. The Judge's decision is transmitted to the Authority and
   served on the parties.

  Exceptions to a Judge's Decision

         A party wishing to file exceptions to a Judge's decision must do
   so within 25 days after the date of service of the decision and in
   conformance with Part 2429 of the Authority's Regulations. The
   Authority may, on review of the exceptions, affirm, modify or reverse
   in whole or in part decisions of the Judges. Decisions of the Authority
   may be appealed to an appropriate appellate court on a petition for
   judicial review under section 7123 of the Statute. The Office of
   Solicitor represents the FLRA and defends the decisions in court. If no
   exceptions are filed to a Judge's decision, the decision is adopted by
   the Authority and, without precedential significance, becomes final and
   binding on the parties.

Settlement Judge Program (ADR)

         The voluntary unfair labor practice settlement program was
   established in the Office of Administrative Law Judges in mid-1995.
   This voluntary settlement program, described in section 2423.25(d) of
   the Authority's Regulations, may be initiated by any of the parties to
   a pending ULP case in which a complaint has been issued by the General
   Counsel and a hearing date before a Judge has been set. If all parties
   to the proceeding agree, a conference at a mutually agreeable date and
   time is set by the Settlement Judge -- usually prior to the pre-hearing
   conference -- and the parties discuss possible resolutions of the
   dispute without resort to litigation. The process is confidential in
   that nothing discussed at the conference is disclosed to the Judge
   designated to preside at the hearing if settlement efforts are
   unsuccessful. The program has achieved wide success, with more than 800
   ULP complaints referred through the settlement process. Successful
   settlements were reached in well over 80 percent of those cases.
