     What do all scientists have in common? No, it is not that they wear
   pocket protectors or are geeks. It is that they all ask questions. Lots
   and lots of questions, since asking questions about what you see is one
   way to figure out how things work. Here at NASA's Goddard Space Flight
   Center, there are lots of people working towards a better understanding
       of the Universe around us. However, it is not always clear how
   particular observations can shed light on how our Universe works. Have
    you ever wondered how scientists work to understand the things in the
    skies around us? Have you ever wondered what the rocket scientists at
    NASA DO at work all day? Or how they spend their weekend? To give you
    an idea about the people who are the scientists here and the kinds of
   research they are pursuing, we have put together some profiles for you.
    There will be a new scientist featured about once every six months...
        but old scientists never die, they just move to the archive!
