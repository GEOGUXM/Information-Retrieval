   FRAP has produced two previous assessments: California's Forest
   Resources: Preliminary Assessment (1979) and California's Forests and
   Rangelands: Growing Conflict Over Changing Uses (1988). A focused
   summary of resources was developed as part the California Fire Plan
   (1996). Another full-scale assessment is in preparation and should be
   finished by early 2002.

   All current assessment work is available on the projects, publications,
   and data portions of our site. You may also search our site if you are
   looking for something specific. Please note that our search engine uses
   keywords developed from our legislative mandate, although you may enter
   your own.

   To obtain copies of the 1979 and 1988 Assessment documents, along with
   Forest Policy documents developed by the State Board of Forestry,
