Welcome to California! :)

   A wet winter is followed by burgeoning plant growth, and few of us here
   need to be reminded that that means fire danger during the dry months
   of summer.

   If you live in a wildfire danger area, now is a good time to think
   about clearing defensible space around your home early in the growing
   season while the problem is small. Don't forget to create a family
   escape-and-regroup plan, too.

   Earthquakes, of course, can strike at any time of year. Get the facts
   on what to do before, during, and after from the Association of Bay
   Area Governments and the Office of Emergency Services. Not pleasant
   things to think about, to be sure, but preparedness saves homes and
   lives.

AFRD Version of Standard Vugraf Template

   Download it in Microsoft Word for the Mac format, the interchangeable
   Rich Text Format based on the Word version, or Microsoft PowerPoint for
   the Mac format. Softcopy is also available in the outbox of Joe Chew's
   Macintosh in zone Net R48. (Look for the folder !Joe Chew Outbox on the
   disk Joe Chew 8500.) The generic Lab version resides on the Workstation
   Group public access server.

  Do's and Dont's

   Do use the header and (if desired) the footer seen in the example
          vugraf that has been circulated.
          Don't remove or fool around with the Berkeley Lab name or logo.

   Do feel free to add things like your group's name, file paths, revision
          date, etc., as long as they don't alter or drown out the
          aforementioned corporate identity elements.
          Don't add supportive or decorative elements to the point of
          overwhelming your point. A little goes a long way.

   Do use landscape format whenever possible.
          Don't fret about using portrait format on some individual
          vugrafs where it is advisable rhetorically (e.g., a figure that
          is and shall always be vertical) or required by pragmatism
          (e.g., a figure that comes from another lab, a copy of a letter
          of commendation or an MOA, that sort of thing).

   Do consider using PowerPoint, and the template provided in PowerPoint
          format. (Your program administrators have it and know how to use
          it.) Also, computerized presentation systems like the one in
          50-5132 all speak PowerPoint.
          Don't feel compelled to buy PowerPoint and learn it under a
          tight deadline if you customarily make your vugrafs yourself in
          some other program. As long as you can make them look more or
          less like the standard, nobody really cares what software they
          came from. Use PowerPoint (or have your administrator do so) if
          that would make your life easier; use programs more familiar to
          you to achieve comparable results otherwise.
