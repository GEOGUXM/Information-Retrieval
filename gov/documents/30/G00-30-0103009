              NIH Image Processing Special Interest Group(SIG)
                          Seminar/Discussion Pages.

   This SIG provides an opportunity for any interested persons to
   participate in seminars and discussions regarding image processing,
   image analysis and imaging software.

Meeting Times.

   The NIH Image Processing SIG usually meets every third Thursday at
   11:00 AM in the conference room of the Laboratory of Diagnostic
   Radiology Research (LDRR) located in Building 10, Room B1N256 of the
   National Institues of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892.

   Additional meetings are scheduled according to the availability of
   speakers. If you are sponsering a talk in any area of image processing
   and would like to invite us, please send email to John Ostuni.
   Typically, you can expect approximately 20 extra people, but this
   depends heavily on the topic. Alternately, if you are a member of this
   SIG, you can simply send email image@list.nih.gov and broadcast it
   yourself.
