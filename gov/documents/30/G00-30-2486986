   Did you Hear?
   December 26, 2001 - Access to IEEE Explore has been restored. While the
   JPL Library does not expect further problems with access to IEEE
   Explore, the Library will continue to monitor access until the full
   NASA purchase order process is completed in February 2002.

   Due to delays in passing the 2002 NASA budget, JPL access to IEEE
   Explore was temporarily suspended from December 1, 2001 through
   December 26, 2001.

   On December 26, 2001 the JPL Library improved the links for IEEE
   electronic journal titles by linking you directly to the IEEE journal,
   rather than to a generic IEEE Explore page.
