   The solar wind streams off of the Sun in all directions at speeds of
   about 400 km/s (about 1 million miles per hour). The source of the
   solar wind is the Sun's hot corona. The temperature of the corona is so
   high that the Sun's gravity cannot hold on to it. Although we
   understand why this happens we do not understand the details about how
   and where the coronal gases are accelerated to these high velocities.
   This question is related to the question of coronal heating.

                            Solar Wind Variations

   The solar wind is not uniform. Although it is always directed away from
   the Sun, it changes speed and carries with it magnetic clouds,
   interacting regions where high speed wind catches up with slow speed
   wind, and composition variations. The solar wind speed is high (800
   km/s) over coronal holes and low (300 km/s) over streamers. These high
   and low speed streams interact with each other and alternately pass by
   the Earth as the Sun rotates. These wind speed variations buffet the
   Earth's magnetic field and can produce storms in the Earth's
   magnetosphere.

   The Ulysses spacecraft has now completed one orbit through the solar
   system during which it passed over the Sun's south and north poles. Its
   measurements of the solar wind speed, magnetic field strength and
   direction, and composition have provided us with a new view of the
   solar wind.

   The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite was launched in
   August of 1997 and placed into an orbit about the L1 point between the
   Earth and the Sun. The L1 point is one of several points in space where
   the gravitational attraction of the Sun and Earth are equal and
   opposite. This particular point is located about 1.5 million km (1
   million miles) from the Earth in the direction of the Sun. ACE has a
   number of instruments that monitor the solar wind and the spacecraft
   team provides real-time information on solar wind conditions at the
   spacecraft.
