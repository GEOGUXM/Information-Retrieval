    Aeronomy Lab Quarterly Reports

   Each laboratory prepares and submits quarterly reports to EEO. The
   format used by each laboratory covers the following topics:
    A. Resources dedicated to the EEO program
    B. Special positions established
    C. Community and Education Outreach
    D. Awards and
    E. Training

   For anyone in the David Skaggs Research Center interested in persuing
   the AL's most current EEO Quaterly Report, it is posted on the bulletin
   board located in the northern block second floor across from Room
   2A123.

    Available Resources

     * The Aeronomy Lab has an elementary-age school kit containing a 30
       minute video entitled "Our Ozone Layer: Its Science and Its
       Protection." Three handouts compliment the video: Our Ozone Shield,
       Common Questions About Ozone, and a hands-on Mini Page entitled
       "Working to Solve the Ozone Problem." Students can make their own
       ozone molecules with styrofoam balls and pipe cleaners included in
       the kit.
       Anyone may contact the AL EEO Representative listed above to
       reserve the kit.
     * The Aeronomy Lab has a copy of the AMS video "Careers in
       Meteorology". To quote the letter from the AMS that accompanied the
       video: "The Weather Channel (TWC), in response to a proposal
       brought forth by the AMS Board of Women and Minorities, has created
       a career video targeting middle school kids to highlight not only
       the diversity of opportunities in the various atmospheric and
       related oceanic and hydrologic sciences, but also to highlight the
       diversity of those working in these jobs. TWC decided to create
       this career video as the kick off to a brand new series of shows
       for their on-air/online educational outreach called The Weather
       Classroom. TWC funded the entire production of the video. For your
       reference, TWC also offers teacher enhancement materials, which
       complement this video.
       Anyone may contact the AL EEO Representative listed above to check
       out this video.
     * EEO Audio/Video Library
       Contact the EEO Office, Becky Rios x6439, for titles and
       availability.

    EEO Sponsored Events

     * Various topics and speakers are scheduled throughout the year.
       Check here for updated information on times and topics.
     * The Survey/Feedback/Action (SFA) 2002 kickoff is January 22, 2002.
       SFA is a NOAA-wide all employee survey as part of the NOAA
       organizational assessment. It is a process to identify people's
       perceptions about the way NOAA works, with a purpose to improve the
       quality of worklife in NOAA to better enable us to accomplish our
       mission and professional goals on individual, group, and
       organizational levels. The results of this study will allow OAR to
       make more informed decisions for the future of the organization.
       With this information, OAR will better understand and manage those
       initiatives which effect us all so that the differences of ALL are
       recognized, understood, and respected.
     * "Bring a Child to Work Day" is an annual event held at the end of
       April. Contact Ann Bradford in the NOAA Outreach Office for more
       information.

    Special Emphasis Programs
