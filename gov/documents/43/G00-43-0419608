  [b1_dot.gif] General Information

   Six weekly camp sessions from July 23 to August 31 are planned for
   Summer 2001.
   We have adopted the following enrollment approach in order to ensure
   that we can operate the camp for the lowest fees possible while
   covering our expenses.
   Registration opens Feb 15, 2001 and is limited to 30 campers per weekly
   session. Early registration is highly recommended.

  [b1_dot.gif] Scholarship Program [new720.gif]

   Financial assistance is available to a maximum of 4 children per week.
   The financial aid is a partial-scholarship that will reduce the fees to
   $95 per week. Two parital-scholarships will be given to employees of
   LBNL and two to non-LBNL employees. Each child may receive one
   partial-scholarship for one week of the entire six weeks of camp.
   Applicants for financial assistance scholarships should submit all of
   the required registration forms and a recommendation letter from a
   teacher or other adult, not a member of the child's family.
