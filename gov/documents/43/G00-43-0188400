                          Western Boundary Currents


   Transport variations in the Florida Current are being continually
   monitored by measuring the cross-stream voltages using an in-service
   cable between West Palm Beach, Florida, and Eight Mile Rock, Grand
   Bahama Island, and an abandoned cable between Key West, Florida, and
   Havana, Cuba. Fifteen years of these voltage-derived transport
   measurements from the cables have been collected. The data are being
   used in models of the circulation off the East Coast of the United
   States, and to evaluate numerical models being developed for climate
   studies. Voltage measurements are being made in several other locations
   by a number of different researchers in the Pacific and Atlantic
   oceans, and are in the planning stages for other cables.

   Ocean Transport from Cable Measurements
          Daily mean transport computed from voltage measurements on
          cables across the Florida Straits.
