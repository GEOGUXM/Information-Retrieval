LIFESTYLE

   Calexico is one of California’s best kept secrets. A delightful blend
   of American and Mexican cultures, Calexico’s small-town lifestyle,
   combined with its convenient proximity to the metropolitan areas of
   Mexicali and San Diego, make it a great place to live. Calexico’s
   climate is sunny year-round, and offers little to inhibit outdoor
   recreation. Golfing, water sports, hunting, fishing and hiking are all
   available in the immediate area, and the beautiful beaches of San Diego
   and Baja California are easily accessible for day trips or fun-filled
   vacations. Just across the border, Mexicali is a cultural and
   entertainment center offering ample opportunity for fine dining,
   theatre, music and more.
