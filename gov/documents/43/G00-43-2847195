   Advocates CONTACT: Regina Birdsell, or January 22, 2002 415-703-2544
   Danilo Sanchez 415-703-2271 THE OFFICE OF RATEPAYER ADVOCATES FINDS
   VERIZON MISPLACED MORE THAN $100 MILLION, ASKS THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC
   UTILITIES COMMISSION TO TRACK VERIZON'S PROFITS FOR POSSIBLE CUSTOMER
   REFUND POSSIBILY AS MUCH AS $50 ANNUALLY Today the Office of Ratepayer
   Advocates (ORA) presented testimony on its financial audit of Verizon
   California. ORA uncovered significant misreporting totaling more than
   $100 million over the audit years from 1996 to 1998. Including the
   effect of excess earnings, ORA estimates the total to be about $50 per
   customer annually. ORA's Director, Regina Birdsell, said ``based on our
   investigation of Verizon, we're asking the Commission to take strong
   steps to resuscitate its regulatory oversight and set the stage to
   protect the financial interests of consumers served by this company. In
   all fairness, the Commission should make sure these dollars get back to
   Verizon's customers.'' Problems found in the audit include Verizon's
   internal controls, cost shifting and misallocation, and non-compliance
   with the Commission's affiliate transaction rules. ORA is asking the
   Commission to decide in favor of consumers now and in the final phase
   of the case at the end of 2002 to: Audit Verizon's regulated and
   affiliate operations at least every three years Adjust Verizon's rates
   based on the audit findings, and Immediately restore the previous
   limits on Verizon's earnings and set up a special account to track its
   earnings for possible refunds to customers. ORA conducted the audit
   from mid-1999 to spring 2000 as part of the California Public Utilities
   Commission's third review of regulation for Pacific Bell and Verizon.
   The overall review will be completed in early 2003. The case will
   investigate the auditing practices and financial results for these two
   companies, to evaluate their quality of service and to decide if any
   changes need to be made to these practices and to the regulations
   currently used to protect consumers. ORA completed an audit to
   evaluate, for example, if Verizon had been shifting costs and revenues
   between affiliated companies, which might harm consumers and
   competitors alike. This was the first comprehensive audit of Verizon
   since 1989: Time - 18 months from July, 1999, to December, 2000
   Investigation - Made over 1,000 separate requests for data and
   interviewed more than 30 employees Documentation - Six separate volumes
   totaling over 1,000 pages ORA is asking the Commission to audit
   Verizon's regulated operations and affiliate companies at least every
   three years. After issuing its audit report last spring, ORA began
   discussions with Verizon and The Utility Reform Network (TURN) to
   remedy Verizon's accounting practices. As a result of these
   discussions, the company agreed to correct about $50 million of its
   reported earnings and to change other non-financial practices such as
   intercompany transactions for the period identified in ORA's audit
   report. ORA, Verizon and TURN are submitting a joint exhibit today,
   which describes each audit recommendation and the remedies agreed to by
   Verizon. Verizon disputes the balance of about $62 million representing
   a single adjustment related to affiliate earnings. ORA is asking the
   Commission to adjust Verizon's rates based on the total financial
   adjustments. ORA reviewed overall after-tax earnings in Verizon's
   California operations from 1996 to 2001 (estimated). The after-tax
   returns on assets (ROA) and on equity (ROE) have increased to
   astounding levels (see the attached graphic) and the regulated assets
   declined about $700 million: ROA - Exceeded the 10.5% authorized by the
   Commission in every year from 1996 to 2001 (estimated). ROE - Increased
   almost three times since 1996 to more than an estimated 31%. This
   explosion in earnings occurred in a period when the Commission did not
   require Verizon to share its excess earnings with customers. ORA is
   asking the Commission to immediately take these remedial actions:
   Restore the previous ROA earnings cap in Verizon's sharing mechanism.
   Set up a special account as of January 1, 2002, to track Verizon's
   earnings and order that these rates be collected subject to being
   refunded to customers. If taken, these actions would preserve the
   Commission's full range of options on reducing Verizon's rates and
   refunding excess earnings to customers in the final phase of this case
   later this year and early 2003. Year Return on Shareholders' Equity (%)
