   FSL is involved in several major research and development projects,
   many of which cross organizational boundaries.

   Education Projects

      Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE)
             This is a worldwide network of students, teachers, and
             scientists working together to study and understand the global
             environment.

   Data Distribution

      Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System (MADIS)
             This project provides value-added, quality-controlled
             observations from FSL's Central Facility for the purpose of
             supporting meteorological research. Included in MADIS, is
             software to make it easy to read the observations.

   Weather Forecasting

      FSL's Daily Weather Briefing
             Most weekday mornings at 11am, FSL meteorologists perform a
             weather briefing. This link provides information about, and
             weather information often used during, the briefing.

   Systems Development

      WFO-Advanced
             The goal of this project is to develop a workstation that will
             support modernized National Weather Service (NWS) Weather
             Forecast Office (WFO) operations.

      Interactive Forecast Preparation System (IFPS)
             This is the system designed for interactive graphical forecast
             preparation in AWIPS, the modernized weather forecast office
             display system. For more information see the presentation slides
             from the recent FSL GFESuite Technical Review.

      Display 3D
             This system is designed for operational forecasters to view
             model output and real-time meteorological data in a
             three-dimensional interactive display.

      Aviation Gridded Forecast Systems
             The Aviation Gridded Forecast System (AGFS) will generate the
             high-resolution Aviation Impact Variables (AIV) required to
             tailor products to aviation decision-makers and support
             automation of the air traffic control systems.

      Aviation Digital Data Service (ADDS)
             The Aviation Digital Data Service (ADDS) provides the most
             complete source of aviation-related weather information on the
             Internet. In addition to providing conventional products and
             observations, ADDS provides state-of-the-art graphical forecasts
             for icing, turbulence, and convection. And ADDS provides
             advanced interactive methods for viewing those forecasts. ADDS
             is being developed jointly by FSL, the Research Applications
             Program of NCAR, and the NWS Aviation Weather Center; funding is
             provided by the FAA Aviation Weather Research Program.

      Local Data Acquistion and Dissemination System (LDAD)
             In association with its modernization program, FSL has developed
             a Local Data Acquisition and Dissemination System (LDAD) that
             includes a WWW based weather dissemination system. This
             development effort includes conducting experiments to determine
             the use of advanced meteorological information by local
             government operations. Local emergency preparedness agencies
             (involving emergency preparedness, sheriff and police
             departments) can gain great benefit from appropriate information
             about local weather hazards. The LDAD WWW Dissemination system
             uses high-resolution weather datasets produced by AWIPS.

   Observing Systems

      Global Atmosphere-Ocean IN-situ System (GAINS) Project
             This project (formerly the Shear-Directed Balloon Project), is
             developing a long-duration platform, instrumented for
             environmental sensing through a combination of dropsondes,
             expendable bathythermographs, in-situ sensors, and remote
             sensors. Designed as a 110-ft diameter superpressure vehicle
             carrying a payload of 500 pounds for year-long flights at 65,000
             ft, GAINS is targeted to meet NOAA's observing and monitoring
             mission in the next century.

      Ground-Based GPS IPW Demonstration Network
             The Demonstration Division operates and maintains the
             Ground-Based GPS Water Vapor Demonstration Network, currently
             consisting of 60 sites located in the contiguous 48 states and
             Alaska. This observing system measures the integrated (total
             column) quantity of precipitable water vapor above a fixed site
             in near real time. This is achieved by estimating the excess GPS
             signal path length caused by the Earth's atmosphere, and
             partitioning this delay into its wet and dry components. It uses
             techniques originally developed to correct high precision
             measurements of very long baselines for applications such as
             monitoring continental drift.

      NOAA Profiler Network
             The Demonstration Division also manages, operates, and maintains
             the NOAA Profiler Network, consisting of 32 wind profilers
             located mostly in the central United States. Wind profilers are
             upward looking, highly sensitive 404 MHz Doppler radars that can
             measure the winds above the profiler site. They are specifically
             designed to measure vertical profiles of horizontal wind speed
             and direction.

      Quality Control and Monitoring System (QCMS)
             This system is being developed by the Systems Development
             Division - Scientific Applications Group to supply end-users and
             suppliers of hydrometeorological observations with
             readily-available quality control information and statistics.

      Regional Radar Volume Project
             Woody Roberts directs this project, which intends to develop a
             regional scale mosaic of WSR-88D data on a 3-dimensional
             Cartesian grid. Wide-band radar data are used for this mosaic of
             reflectivity, radial velocity, and derived U and V wind
             components. This mosaic can be used for display purposes as well
             as numerical model input.

      Simulation of a Satellite-Borne, Wind-Finding Lidar System
             Along with the Environmental Technology Laboratory and the
             Environmental Modeling Center of NCEP, FSL is partcipating in a
             two-year study of the potential impact of a wind-finding lidar
             that could be flown on a polar orbiting satellite. A January
             2000 progress report is available.

   Modeling and Data Assimilation

      Mesoscale Analysis and Prediction System (MAPS) / Rapid Update Cycle
             (RUC)
             This regional data assimilation and forecast system provides
             high-frequency (every 1 h) 3-D analyses over the contiguous
             United States and short-range forecasts (out to 12 h) in support
             of aviation and other mesoscale forecast users. The RUC runs o
             perationally at the National Centers for Environmental
             Prediction (NCEP), and MAPS runs experimentally at FSL with
             forecasts out to 36 h every 6 h.

      Local Analysis and Prediction System (LAPS)
             This system integrates data from virtually every meteorological
             observation system into a very high-resolution gridded framework
             centered on a forecast office's domain of responsibility.

      Mesoscale Analysis and Prediction System (MAPS) Surface Assimilation
             System (MSAS)
             This surface data assimilation system produces hourly analyses
             of meteorological conditions at the earth's surface. MSAS also
             runs operationally at the Nation Centers for Environmental
             Prediction (NCEP), and in NWS forecast offices as part of the
             AWIPS system.

      Turbulence Forecast Product
             The turbulence forecast product is generated with a diagnostic
             algorithm designed as part of FSL's efforts to develop, test,
             and verify numerical weather models and parameterizations for
             forecasting variables of special interest to aviation.

      High Performance Computing
             The High Performance Computing Section guarantees continued
             progress toward higher-resolution analyses and forecasts by
             porting FSL and NMC models to massively parallel processors
             (MPPs), including FSL's own supercomputer.
