                                      Ecosystem Processes Division

                 The Ecosystem Processes Division seeks to understand the effects of
   natural and human-induced environmental factors on fishery resources,
   and ultimately to predict the effects of variation in such factors on
   the composition, distribution, abundance, and production of fishery
   resources. An emphasis is placed on the study of reproductive activity
   and early life stages since these are generally the most vulnerable to
   environmental variation. Research is principally process-oriented,
   which includes both field and lab studies.
