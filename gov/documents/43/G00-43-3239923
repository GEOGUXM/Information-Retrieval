   Welcome to the User Application Support (UAS) group home page.

   New! Community-Support mailing lists! Several mailing lists have been
   established so that the user community can more effectively help each
   other to use the available software tools and utilities.

   Got a question? Look at the community support mailing lists. If you
   can't find an appropriate list, We recommend that you send mail to
   helpdesk@fnal.gov or call x2345, but you may also contact the UAS group
   directly by sending mail to uas-group@fnal.gov.
     __________________________________________________________________

Software We Provide:

   Use upc to check the status of your favorite UPS product (i.e., which
   versions are available in kits and/or on fnalu, which versions are
   "current" or "test" or unchained, etc.).

   See the fnal.announce.products and/or fnal.announce.unix newsgroups for
   recent product release information.

   The software packages we support fully include:
     * FUE - the core products of the Fermi User Environment
          + bootstrap, to install FUE the first time
          + coreFUE, which contains ups, upd, and perl.
          + fullFUE, which contains coreFUE plus systools (Fermi-specific
            system administration utilities) and futil (Fermi-specific
            user utilities)
     * tape support (ftt, rbio, fmb, juke...)
     * login shells ( bash, tcsh) and scripting languages and tools (
       perl, python, expect, tk, tcl, blt, tktools)
     * Freeware compilers and debuggers (gcc, gdb, dddebugger...)

   We also make various software packages available, without providing
   full support for them (user consulting for these is generally handled
   via the community support mailing lists). These include:
     * email readers (exmh, mh, pine) and news readers (news, netscape)
     * editors (emacs, xemacs, tpu and the fermitpu extensions, edt...)
       Note: nedit is a very popular editor, supported and developed by
       members of the PAT department.
     * web browsers (netscape, lynx), and web servers (apache)
     * auxiliary web products (ghostview, ximagetools, xpdf...)
     * word processing utilities (tex/latex, conv2html, ispell, psutils)
     * GNU tools (gtools, groff,...)

   We do NOT provide CERNLIB, X terminal, or Computer Simulation support;
   these are supported by the PAT (Physics Analysis Tools) Department. We
   also do not support the Online software.

Additional Resources and Documentation for UAS Products:

     * A checklist of steps that OSS members should take when preparing
       products for distribution -- this includes packaging the product to
       ups standards for distribution from fnkits.fnal.gov via upd, as
       well as the additional beaureaucratic overhead of news postings,
       documentation, etc.
     * A snapshot of the products we have released in ups v4 format -- all
       of which include instances which will run on Linux. (November 1998)
     * The directions we are taking, and why, with /usr/local/products
       links. (October 1998)
       Closely related: Trampoline files for shell scripting languages.
       How do we meet all of the following requirements, within the FUE
       environment?
          + must be able to install and use multiple concurrent versions
            of the product
          + must be able to run a particular version when requested (via
            setup)
          + must be able to run a "default" version from a static, known
            location without requiring setup
     * Y2K statement from UAS. In particular, fmb is a product that is
       mission-critical and will need to be tested.
     * UAS Policy and Priorities regarding supported platforms. (September
       1998)
     * General Documentation (look here first!) and information about
       offline applications. Or browse the product documentation area.
     * UPC (Product Status Report), where you can get detailed information
       on the status of any product(s) you wish.
     * UAS reports from the Unix User Meetings. Other presentations from
       Unix User Meetings (held monthly). (Well, they used to be held
       monthly; they haven't been held regularly for quite some time, and
       UAS hasn't had any presentations other than product status updates,
       since 1997.
     * UNIX Resources, which lists many other sources of information about
       UNIX, including the UNIX at Fermilab manual.
     * Email and You, a presentation given in April 1997 concerning: the
       alias fnalu, what it means and when you should (and shouldn't!) use
       it; some information about your .forward file; and information on
       how to move your PINE mail from the system spool area to your own
       home area (a very good idea!).

Projects We Support:

     * Linux Application Support: our considerations and priorities in
       providing user applications under Linux.
     * FUE (Fermi UNIX Environment)
     * Run 2 Computing and some of its Working Groups:
          + Configuration Management
          + C++
          + Code Management
     * Fermi Modular Backup (fmb).
     * FermiTools software repository.
     * ... and some of us are involved in the Auditorium Committee ...

Useful Reference Places:

     * CD Documentation and Software, which describes the various places
       wherein one may find useful information about software
     * CD Documentation DB, a searchable database of Computing Division
       documents
     * Build Machines: a list of the officially designated machines where
       the UAS (and other groups') products are compiled and linked.

Members of UAS:

     * Lauri Loebel Carpenter (lauri@fnal.gov), Group Leader, x2214.
     * Wayne Baisley (baisley@fnal.gov, x8490
     * Chuck DeBaun (debaun@fnal.gov), x3522
     * Marc Mengel (mengel@fnal.gov), x8256
     * Donna Reid (donnar@fnal.gov), x2379
     * Mike Stolz (stolz@fnal.gov), x8060

Our mission is to:

     * obtain and/or develop "general purpose" UNIX offline software
       utilities,
     * assemble these into standard FUE-compliant software packages,
     * make them available to the Fermi user community through kits
       distribution,
     * install packages as required on the fnalu general purpose UNIX
       cluster,
     * provide consulting on the installation (and, frequently, the use)
       of said packages on other clusters,
     * develop and/or maintain the necessary infrastructure to perform the
       above duties.
