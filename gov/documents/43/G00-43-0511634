                        United States Supreme Court

    The United States Supreme Court consists of the Chief Justice of the
     United States and eight associate justices. At its discretion, and
    within certain guidelines established by Congress, the Supreme Court
    each year hears a limited number of the cases it is asked to decide.
   Those cases may begin in the federal or state courts, and they usually
   involve important questions about the Constitution or federal law. For
               more information about the Supreme Court, visit
