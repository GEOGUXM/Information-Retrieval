Introduction

   The Board of Regents, on the recommendation of the Commissioner of
   Education, appoints a State Board for each licensed profession to
   advise and assist the Board of Regents and the State Education
   Department on matters of professional regulation. The Board of Regents
   also appoints a Committee for Professional Assistance to advise them on
   matters relating to practice by professional licensees with alcohol or
   other drug abuse problems. The 25 State Boards for the Professions and
   the Committee for Professional Assistance are comprised of professional
   members and one or more representatives of the general public. The
   composition of each board and the Committee is specified in Title VIII
   of Education Law. In addition, Board and Committee composition should
   reflect the State's regions, cultural diversity, and the various
   aspects of the professions.

   Professional board members must be New York State-licensed
   professionals who are residents of the State. For many boards,
   professional member appointees must have at least five years of
   experience. Committee members are not required to be licensed
   professionals.

   Every State Board must also have at least one public representative
   (and in some cases up to five public members), who is a consumer of
   services of the profession(s) on which the board advises. The
   individual must be a New York State resident and meet various
   requirements to ensure that the public perspective is not compromised.

Responsibilities

   Committee for Professional Assistance must be dedicated to public

   licensing requirements, licensing examinations and practice issues, and
   provide community outreach, as well as participate in licensure
   disciplinary and/or restoration and moral character proceedings.
   Members of the Committee for Professional Assistance advise on matters
   relating to impaired practice, administer the Professional Assistance
   Program, and serve on panels for Program admission or professional
   license reinstatement.
