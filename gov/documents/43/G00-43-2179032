      LIVERMORE, Calif.  Scientists from the Lawrence Livermore National
      Laboratory, in collaboration with the W.M. Keck Observatory, have
      created a "virtual" guide star over Hawaii. The "virtual" guide star
      will be used with adaptive optics on the Keck II telescope to greatly
      increase the resolution of fine details of astronomical objects.
      Installed in 1999, the Keck adaptive optics system has enabled
      astronomers to minimize the blurring effects of the Earths atmosphere,
      producing images with unprecedented detail and resolution. The adaptive
      optics system uses light from a relatively bright star to measure the
      atmospheric distortions and to correct for them, but only about one
      percent of the sky contains stars sufficiently bright to be of use. The
      new virtual guide star will enable Keck astronomers to study nearly the
      entire sky with the high resolution of adaptive optics.
      The virtual guide star, which achieved "first light" on Dec. 23, 2001,
      was created using a 20-watt dye laser to illuminate a diffuse layer of
      sodium atoms that exists 60 miles (95 km) above the Earths surface.
      When activated by the laser, the sodium atoms produced a very small
      source of light, less than a meter (39 inches) in diameter, that
      allowed the adaptive optics system to measure the distortions of the
      atmosphere.
      The resulting virtual star was measured at 9.5 magnitude, about 25
      times fainter than anything that can be seen by the unaided eye, but
      bright enough to operate the adaptive optics system. The star appeared
      orange, the familiar color of common low-pressure sodium vapor
      streetlights. The virtual guide star system was developed in
      collaboration with the W.M. Keck Observatory, with additional support
      provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
      and the National Science Foundations Center for Adaptive Optics (CfAO)
      at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
      Scientists and engineers from the Laser Science & Technology Division
      of the National Ignition Facility Directorate at LLNL played a key role
      in preparing the laser that creates the guide star. For 2 1/2 years,
      Deanna Pennington, Curtis Brown, Pam Danforth and Holger Jones worked
      in Hawaii redesigning, demonstrating and commissioning the laser system
      on the telescope so that the "virtual" guide star could achieve "first
      light."
      The team hopes to integrate the system with adaptive optics in June
      when they will be able to see a real star.

      Adaptive optics refers to the ability to compensate or adapt to
      turbulence in the Earths atmosphere, removing the blurring of
      starlight. Adaptive optics systems measure the distortions of the light
      from a star and then remove the distortions by bouncing the light off a
      deformable mirror that corrects the image several hundred times per
      second.
      With Keck adaptive optics, for which LLNL scientists developed the fast
      real-time control system, astronomers are obtaining infrared images
      with four times better resolution than the Hubble Space Telescope,
      which orbits high above the Earths atmosphere. Many significant
      discoveries have already been attributed to Keck adaptive optics, and
      the Keck virtual guide star will lead to many more.
      "We have seen lasers develop into powerful tools in fields ranging from
      medicine to compact disc players," said Claire Max of LLNL and the
      University of California, Santa Cruz, principal investigator for the
      Keck laser project. "Our new virtual guide star marks the start of a
      new era, when well see lasers contributing to astronomy as well."
      The Keck virtual guide star system consists of a dye laser that is used
      to produce light with the wavelength of the atomic sodium resonance
      line at 589 nm. The 20-watt output of the dye laser is projected out of
      a 20-inch (50 cm) lens attached to the side of the 10-meter Keck II
      telescope. It is based on a concept originally implemented by LLNL
      scientists at the University of Californias Lick Observatory at Mount
      Hamilton, CA.
      "We asked for an early present this year, and just before Christmas we
      were given a virtual star that will dramatically increase the research
      capabilities of the worlds largest telescope," said Dr. Frederic
      Chaffee, director of the W.M. Keck Observatory. "This effort could not
      have been possible without the talent and dedication of our adaptive
      optics and laser guide star team. We couldnt be happier with these
      results, and we look forward to fully integrating the laser with our
      adaptive optics system by the middle of 2002."
      The main components of the Keck adaptive optics system are a wavefront
      sensor camera, a fast control computer and a deformable mirror. The
      wavefront sensor camera measures distortions due to atmospheric
      turbulence using light from the guide star. A control computer computes
      the wavefront distortion up to 670 times a second and sends commands to
      the deformable mirror. The deformable mirror, about six inches (15 cm)
      in diameter, is made out of a thin sheet of reflective glass controlled
      by 349 actuators that can adjust the shape of the mirror by several
      microns, a distance large enough to correct for atmospheric
      distortions.
      The Keck virtual guide star system is the worlds most powerful laser
      currently in use at an astronomical telescope. The laser was developed
      by LLNL and LLNL staff played a key role in the deployment of the laser
      at the telescope.
