   The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS), located in Boulder,
   CO, is interested in receiving inquiries from students with engineering
   and/or computer science backgrounds for full-time and part-time paid
   and volunteer internship positions. Typically, full-time positions are
   held during the summer and often continue as part-time positions during
   the fall and spring semesters.
   Students presently in an undergraduate engineering program or graduate
   students with an undergraduate engineering degree are of primary
   interest as potential internship candidates. Applicants must be U.S.
   citizens.
   Interested students should submit to the contact listed a brief
   statement of technical research interests and relevant proficiencies
   (inclusion of references and other pertinent background information is
   highly desirable). Additional information may be obtained by contacting
   the appropriate manager.
