Projects

   Abstracts and progress reports for projects funded by the Arctic
   Research Initiative may be found on the website of the Cooperative
   Institute for Arctic Research.
   In FY2001, NOAA received funding to provide scientific support for
   management decisions regarding fisheries and marine mammal interactions
   in the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea. The western population of
   Steller's Sea Lion (SSL) has been in decline for several decades and is
   now considered endangered. There are several possible factors causing
   this decline. One of these factors is commercial fishing in habitat
   critical to the SSL, thought to cause a harmful reduction in SSL prey
   availability. Current management efforts are focused on this factor
   alone. To determine if other factors might be important in the decline
   of the western SSL population, NOAA was directed to conduct research
   focused on two other possible factors, namely impacts of ocean climate
   regime shifts and changes in predator/prey relationships. NOAA's Office
   of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and National Ocean Service have
   funded 16 projects to examine the importance of these two factors on
   SSL decline.

Announcements of Opportunity

   NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration solicited proposals in support of
   its mission to expand knowledge of the oceans' physical, chemical and
   biological environments, processes, characteristics, and resources by
   means of interdisciplinary expeditions to unknown or poorly known
   oceanic regions and through innovative experiments. Proposals had to be
   submitted to the Office of Ocean Exploration no later than 1 p.m. EST
   on November 7, 2001.

   In connection with NOAA's Ocean Exploration Initiative, NOAA held a
   workshop July 25-26, 2001, to discuss activities that could be
   undertaken in the Arctic. Click here to read a summary of the workshop:
   notes from a "brainstorming" session, a summary of specific geographic
   targets for an Arctic expedition, and a list of workshop participants.
