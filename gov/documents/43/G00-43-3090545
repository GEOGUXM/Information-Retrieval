  How to view PDF documents

   [line-blue.gif]

   Files in Portable Document Format (PDF) are viewed with Adobe Acrobat
   Reader. Adobe has FREE Acrobat Reader software available to download
   for DOS, Windows, Macintosh, Sun SPARC, HP, Silicon Graphics, and AIX
   systems.

   You will need to change the settings on your computer so that Acrobat
   Reader is an external viewer or "Helper Application."

   On the Adobe Acrobat Reader web page follow steps 1-3 to download the
   software onto your computer.

   Note: If you are a member of the Environmental Restoration Staff,
   please contact a member of the Desktop Computer Support group to
   install Acrobat Reader on your computer.
