   impact of the Bush Budget:
   The Bush Budget: Truth & Consequences

   This site is designed to connect you with information and analysis on
   the impact of President Bush's budget proposal. Specifically it
   explains how the President's budget threatens Social Security and
   Medicare, shortchanges numerous key American priorities, and imposes
   unnecessary risks on the economy. We hope you will take a moment to
   look at this information to find out what the truth & consequences of
   the Bush Budget may mean for you, your family, and our country's
   future.
