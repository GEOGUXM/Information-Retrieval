                             Cosmology Course @ T8

   The purpose of this course is to provide a comprehensive introduction
   to cosmology - a science that has the `modest' aim of understanding the
   Universe as a whole as well as its parts. We will cover the basic
   material needed to understand recent observational and theoretical
   developments. The course is organised in two parts: Part I introduces
   the relevant pieces of physics and astronomy and Part II presents
   applications of the latter to more recent research results. The
   selection of topics will broadly follow John Peacock's book
   Cosmological Physics. Special talks on advanced topics will be given by
   local as well as external speakers.

   Lectures will be held weekly on Wednesdays at 11.00 am in the
   T-Division conference room (Room 121, Bldng. 123, TA-3). The
   co-organizers are Katrin Heitmann and Luis Teodoro.
