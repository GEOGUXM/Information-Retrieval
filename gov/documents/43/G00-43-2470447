    NOAA Fisheries issued its final EFH regulations on January 17, 2002.
    The regulations provide guidelines to fishery management councils for
   developing the EFH sections of fishery management plans, and establish
    procedures to be used by NOAA Fisheries and other agencies to consult
     and coordinate regarding Federal and state agency actions that may
                            adversely affect EFH.
