[pp_icon.gif] Groundwater Level Data Retrieval by Basin
     __________________________________________________________________

   This page provides access to historical groundwater level data for all
   wells monitored by the Department of Water Resources Central District
   and Northern District, and our cooperators. Retrievals are based on
   your input. The list of groundwater basins below are grouped
   alphabetically according to the hydrologic study area in which they
   lie. You can "jump" to your hydrologic study area of interest by
   clicking on the appropriate hyperlink. Or, scroll through the entire
   list of groundwater basins and click on the hyperlink for the basin in
   which you are interested. Subsequent pages will provide options for
   retrieving data for individual wells.

   The hydrologic study areas which are encompassed by this page include:

          Sacramento Hydrologic Study Area
          San Joaquin Hydrologic Study Area
          San Francisco Bay Hydrologic Study Area
