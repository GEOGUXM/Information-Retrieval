   LANDSAT-7 DATA POLICY
   (Signed March 21, 2000)

   Introduction
   Section 105 of Public Law (P.L.)102‑555, The Land Remote Sensing Policy
   Act of 1992, states "The LANDSAT Program Management (LPM), in
   consultation with other appropriate United States Government (USG)
   agencies, shall develop a data policy for Landsat-7...."The law also
   identifies goals for the policy. This document, in accordance with the
   law, establishes a data policy for Landsat-7 that provides guidelines
   for acquiring, processing, archiving, and distributing unenhanced
   Landsat-7 data products and stipulates the approach to be used for
   establishing associated prices. The Department of the Interior (DOI),
   United States Geological Survey (USGS), as the Landsat-7 mission
   manager, will execute the Landsat-7 Data Policy on behalf of the LPM.
   The LPM is a joint effort of the National Aeronautics and Space
   Administration (NASA) and the DOI/USGS.

   This Data Policy supplements the Management Plan for the LANDSAT
   Program, which defines organizational roles and responsibilities for
   Landsat-7 system development and operations.As required by P.L.
   102‑555, this Data Policy is designed to achieve the following:
    1. Ensure that unenhanced data are available to all users at the cost
       of fulfilling user requests;
    2. Ensure timely and dependable delivery of unenhanced data to the
       full spectrum of civilian, national security, commercial, and
       foreign users, and the National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data
       Archive (NSLRSDA);
    3. Ensure that the United States retains ownership of all unenhanced
       data generated by Landsat-7;
    4. Support the development of the commercial market for remote sensing
       data;
    5. Ensure that the provision of commercial value‑added services based
       on remote sensing data remains exclusively the function of the
       private sector;
    6. To the extent possible, ensure that the data distribution system
       for Landsat-7 is compatible with the Earth Observing System Data
       and Information System (EOSDIS); and, in addition
    7. Encourage research, development, and demonstrations in the
       applications of remote sensing.
