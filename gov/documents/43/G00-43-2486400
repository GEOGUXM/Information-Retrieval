                 The lab is a pretty diverse bunch of people. Currently, we have a
                 small assortment of chemists, biochemists, electrical engineers,
                 chemical engineers, and bioengineers. Needless to say, this makes
                 life interesting. In a good way.


                 The sites accessible to the left introduce the lab members (those
                 who wish to be introduced anyway).
