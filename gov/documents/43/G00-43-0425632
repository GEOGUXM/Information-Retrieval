Help Searching on the GSA.gov Web Portal

Simple Searches

   Overview

   The GSA.gov Portal enables you to perform keyword searches within the
   content managed directly by the portal, as well as searching through
   information and pages currently located outside the portal on other GSA
   websites. By entering search terms in the text entry box located at the
   top of every portal page (between the "Search" link and the "Go"
   button), you can initiate a portal search. The results are returned in
   Search Results Pages.
   Search Results Overview

   The results of a search are returned as a set of page match results
   (described below). The organization of the results page includes the
   number of matches found, the range of matches (e.g, 1-20) displayed on
   the current results page, and a set of navigational links for browsing
   the results set.
   Page Matches

   Searching the portal will return a Page Match result set. This result
   includes information within the portal, and throughout all GSA
   websites, that contains the search terms. It is possible that a search
   may result in no matching pages.

   Page matches are presented in order of decreasing relevance (best match
   first). The match score is included next to the title of the page.
   Below the document title is a short description of the page and a
   navigational link.
   Search Terms and Operators

   Search for phrases by entering the search terms separated by spaces.

   Create compound queries by separating search terms with "and" or "or".

   Perform case-sensitive searches by entering mixed-case terms.
   Case-insensitive searches are performed when either all lowercase or
   all uppercase terms are entered.
