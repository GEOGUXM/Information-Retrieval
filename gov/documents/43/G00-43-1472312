Electric Power Training Center

                               Electric Power Training Center

                               Offering Hands-on Training on a Real Power System

Picture Gallery of EPTC's Miniature Power System (MPS)

   The MPS allows for the generation of real electrical power into the
   eqivalent of 400 miles of transmission lines with one switchyard, two
   fully operational substations and a dispatch center. All controls and
   relays for generation, switching, sub-stations and dispatching are
   actual size as used in the field.

   The MPS is interconnected forming a complex electrical system with real
   operating control switches, operating relays, indicating meters, and
   annunciation. The instructors can apply faults through the instructor's
   control console to simulate real life situations. The students
   experience emergency situations due to voltage losses or rises, and
   overloads or underloads.
