   Based on the forecast for today, snow accumulation is predicted for the
   Chicagoland area.  The amount of snow, however, will vary considerably
   depending on the part of the metropolitan area in which you are
   located.  Because of this, some agencies and their employees will be
   affected by this snowfall, while others will not.

   The Chicago FEB is reminding everyone that in this year's Emergency
   Dismissal and Closure Procedures (memo dated December 6 which is also
   located on main page of FEB Web Page) liberal leave is the default
   policy for most emergency situations.

   As a result, it is anticipated that, unless the weather situation
   changes, the Emergency Advisory Committee will not meet and the default
   policy will stand for those agency executives who need it for their
   employees.
