                           Shape of Things To Come
                       Fruits of the Kearneysville Lab

   Growing an apple or peach tree seems easy. You plant an apple or peach
   seed from luscious fruit you just ate, and up springs a beautiful tree
   that will someday bear the same, good-tasting apples and peachesright?
   Wrong!

   Fruit trees are not grown from seed. "Varieties of peaches, pears, and
   apples must be regrown from their own buds or twigs by grafting them
   onto rootstock," says Agricultural Research Service horticulturist
   Ralph Scorza.

   The size and shape of fruit trees are vitally important to growers for
   ease of tending and picking, as well as yield. In apples, special
   rootstocks are commonly used to dwarf the varieties grafted onto them.
   That's why Scorza and fellow ARS horticulturist Richard L. Bell are
   excited about their latest development: the very first dwarf pear tree
   of an existing variety.

   At the ARS Appalachian Fruit Research Station in Kearneysville, West
   Virginia, they're also changing the shape of peach trees and releasing
   new fruit varieties to give producers more of a choice.

   Dwarfing Benefits Growers and Consumers

   "We've actually been working with several genes that may dwarf pear
   trees, and we've completed research on one of them," Scorza reports.
   "We used this gene, originally isolated from a bacterium, to
   successfully dwarf Bosc pear trees, which are growing in our
   greenhouse. These new dwarfs should bear fruit in 2 to 3 years. We are
   anxious for the first harvest."

   The research can go two ways: The gene may be used to dwarf scions, the
   tree shoots grafted onto dwarfing rootstocks, or to impart
   dwarf-producing properties to the rootstocks. Scorza and colleagues are
   already working with other dwarfing genes for transfer into pear.

   Why dwarf the pear trees? It would allow, for the first time, a
   high-density production system for pears not dependent on quince
   rootstocks that dwarf scions but aren't well adapted to major U.S.
   production districts, Scorza says.

   "Our goal in this particular project is not to produce new varieties.
   The pear industry is based on only a few major varieties, and there is
   a need to improve those. Dwarfing will do that."

   There are many advantages to dwarfing fruit trees. Primarily, they're
   more productive than traditional-size trees. High-density plantings of
   smaller trees can produce more fruit on the same land area than the
   larger, standard-size trees. And they're also easier to prune, spray,
   and harvest. Fruit from a dwarf tree is the same size as fruit from a
   normal tree.

   Changing Tree Shapes

   Not every fruit grower will use dwarf trees. "But all growers know that
   the shape of a fruit tree is vitally important to the tree's
   production," Scorza says. "Right now, all commercial peach trees grow
   one way: large and bushy."

   Scorza and colleagues have developed a columnar peach tree shape. "This
   new tree bears fruit of excellent quality. We expect to release it to
   home gardeners within the next few years, because it takes up very
   little room," Scorza reports. ARS scientists at Kearneysville have been
   working on this project for about 15 years.

   Home gardeners with little space will like the columnar peach tree
   because the upright, narrow branches that grow close to its trunk won't
   shade other vegetables that may be growing close by.

   This research represents a totally new system for commercial peach
   growers. With a tall and narrow shape, the columnar trees require much
   less management and will allow high-density growing. This eliminates
   the large space between trees that is necessary with traditional-size
   peaches. Chemicals and fertilizer need be applied to only a very small
   area, saving the grower money and sparing the environment chemical
   emissions.

   At least three times as many of these columnar trees can be grown per
   unit of land. With the cost of land available for agriculture at an
   all-time high, this is an important factor. Since growers can plant
   more of these trees in an orchard, they could increase production while
   cutting input costs. These savings could be passed on to consumers.

   In the fall of 1998 and spring of 1999, cooperators planted the
   columnar peach trees in orchards in New Jersey, Virginia, West
   Virginia, South Carolina, Arkansas, and Michigan. "We also have
   cooperators in California and Washington who are considering our new
   tree and other shapes that we've developed," says Scorza.

   The Pear Is Plumb Delicious

   In addition to dwarfing and changing the tree shape, Scorza and Bell
   are working on new, improved varieties for fruit growers.

   In 1998, Scorza released a new plum and Bell, in conjunction with
   researchers at Ohio State University, introduced a
   fire-blight-resistant pear. The most serious disease of apples and
   pears, fire blight is caused by the Erwinia amylovora bacterium and has
   no cure.

   Bluebyrd, the new plum, is named for Senator Robert C. Byrd, who
   dedicated the Kearneysville research station in 1979. According to
   Scorza, it gives growers a firm, excellent-quality plum that is 20
   percent sugars. Bluebyrd is a consistently high-producing European-type
   plum for the mid-Atlantic and other fruit-growing regions of the United
   States. "And consumers get a sweet-tasting plum," he says.

   Blake's Pride, a new pear, resists fire blight, while most of the major
   pear varieties are moderately to highly susceptible.

   "Shoots of Blake's Pride are very resistant to fire blightand
   blossoms, moderately so," says Bell. "If blooms do become infected, the
   infection doesn't go deep into the wood. In addition, this high-quality
   pear has excellent aromatic flavor, and the fruit is juicy and
   buttery."

   Blake's Pride should be available in commercial nurseries in 2000, and
   Bluebyrd is available for the first time this year.

   "This research furthers our goal of giving U.S. fruit growers options
   that maximize productivity and quality while reducing the amount of
   chemicals needed," Scorza says.By Doris Stanley Lowe, formerly with
