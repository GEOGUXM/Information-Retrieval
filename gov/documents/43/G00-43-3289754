    Overview

   Thank you for your interest in employment with the California
   Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC). DTSC protects California
   and Californians from exposures to hazardous wastes. More than 1,000
   scientists, engineers and specialized support staff work in nine
   offices statewide to:
     * Deal with the aftermath of improper hazardous waste management by
       overseeing site cleanups.
     * Prevent releases of hazardous waste by seeing that those who
       generate, handle, transport, store and dispose of wastes do so
       properly.
     * Take enforcement actions against those who fail to manage hazardous
       wastes appropriately.
     * Explore and promote means of preventing pollution, and encourage
       reuse and recycling.
     * Evaluate soil, water and air samples taken at sites, and develop
       new analytical methods.
     * Practice other environmental sciences, including toxicology, risk
       assessment and technology development.
     * Involve the public in DTSC's decision-making.
