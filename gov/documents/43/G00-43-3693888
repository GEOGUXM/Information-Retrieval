   NINDS Intramural Research Support Facilities

     The PROTEIN/PEPTIDE SEQUENCING FACILITY provides amino acid sequencing
     of purified proteins/peptides for NINDS investigators. The facility is
     also available for collaborations involving protein/peptide
     purification and more complicated sequencing strategies.

     The DNA SEQUENCING FACILITY provides rapid and reliable automated DNA
     sequencing, assistance with sequence analysis and data storage as
     services for the NINDS intramural neuroscience programs. The Facility
     also incorporates new developments and protocols for DNA sequencing.

     The LIGHT IMAGING FACILITY provides intramural scientists with access
     to state-of-the-art light imaging equipment and expertise in light
     imaging techniques. The Facility offers training and assistance in a
     variety of light microscopic techniques including laser scanning
     confocal microscopy, video microscopy and digital image analysis. A
     digital image printer and slide maker are available for preparing
     illustrations for presentations and publications.

     The EM FACILITY provides intramural NINDS investigators with the
     opportunity to use electron microscopic techniques in their research
     programs. The Facility provides assistance in all aspects of electron
     microscopy including project planning, specimen preparation and
     training.

     The MRI RESEARCH FACILITY/MOUSE IMAGING FACILITY provides intramural
     investigators with intellectual, technical, and material support for
     human and animal imaging studies. The MRI Research Facility is equipped
     with a 1.5 T human MRI system and a 4.7 T animal MRI system. The Mouse
     Imaging Facility's resources include magnetic resonance imaging, high
     frequency ultrasound, computed tomography, laser Doppler blood flow
     imaging and positron emission tomography.

     The RESEARCH SERVICES BRANCH provides intramural investigators with
     engineering and machine shop services, and computer and network
     support. Specific areas of activity include: design and development of
     custom instrumentation systems; design and fabrication of mechanical
     components and systems; on-site computer and network assistance;
     management of central computer facilites, building networks and a users
     area in building 36; and consultation and collaboration in quantitative
     aspects of neurobiology.
