                              Connecting to cdcvs

   As of June 21, rsh access to the cdcvs repository is no longer
   available, instead either ssh with RSA keys, or kerberos rsh, or
   pserver must be used to access the repository. The following table
   should help you determine what sort of access you are using:
Type         $CVS_RSH           $CVSROOT
----         --------           --------
rsh                             cvsuser@cdcvs.fnal.gov:/cvs/cd
rsh          /usr/bin/rsh       cvsuser@cdcvs.fnal.gov:/cvs/cd
ssh          /usr/krb5/bin/ssh  cvsuser@cdcvs.fnal.gov:/cvs/cd
ssh          /usr/local/bin/ssh cvsuser@cdcvs.fnal.gov:/cvs/cd
kerberos-rsh /usr/krb5/bin/rsh  cvsuser@cdcvs.fnal.gov:/cvs/cd
pserver                         :pserver:yourname@cdcvs.fnal.gov:/cvs/cd
anonymous                       :pserver:anonymous@cdcvs.fnal.gov:/cvs/cd_read_o
nly

   For any of these styles of access except anonymous, you also need to be
   registered. For the latter, you need the password "anoncvs".

   Instructions for building your RSA key, needed to register for ssh
   access, are at
     http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/cvs/cvs_ssh.html
   You would then send public key to
     helpdesk@fnal.gov

   Requests for kerberos access involve simply sending email to
     helpdesk@fnal.gov
   with your kerberos principal name

   Requests for psever accounts should go to   helpdesk@fnal.gov
   you will receive a password for use with "cvs login".

   If you are changing access styles in a manner that changes your CVSROOT
   value (see table above) checked-out copies of repositories can be
   converted to their new CVSROOT using the "fixcvsroot" script, available
   for download at:
     http://cdcvs.fnal.gov/
