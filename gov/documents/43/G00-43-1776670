                                    Newsletter

      The CISSR Newsletter was launched in April 2000 to highlight recent or
      current work in progress at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in research
      areas related to in situ and sample return science and technology. Our
      goal is to help the JPL community remain up to date on current efforts
      in the development and maintenance of leading-edge capabilities to
      enable in situ exploration and sample return science and technology
      missions and to ensure that these efforts remain at the forefront.
