   The National Geomagnetic Information Center was formed as part of the
   USGS Magnetic Field Monitoring and Charting Program to meet the growing
   needs of Federal, state, and local governments, and those of industry,
   academia, and the public for geomagnetic data and information. Some of
   these activities include:
     * Distributing Windows95/98/NT and DOS compatible Geomag software.
     * Providing off-line services to users of magnetic field data and
       other information.
     * Distribution of magnetic observatory data to scientific
       organizations worldwide for the production of global geomagnetic
       activity indices such as Kp and Dst.
     * Production of brochures, booklets, and other publications related
       to the Earth's magnetic field and applications for geomagnetic data
       and data products.
     * Attendance at scientific conferences and meetings to display the
       many products and services provided by NGIC.
