  Terminology

   Current - September 2000 streamflow conditions

   Min POR - Minimum daily streamflow at the gaging station for period of
   record

   Annual 7Q10 - Streamflow that occurs over 7 consecutive days and has a
   10-year recurrence interval, or 1 in 10 chance of occurring in every
   one year. Daily stream-flows in the 7Q10 range are general indicators
   of prevelant drought conditions which normally cover large areas

   Monthly 7Q10 - Monthly low-flow statistic determined from daily
   streamflow data on a climatic year basis (April-March). Values are
   computed like the annual 7Q10 but on an individual monthly basis.

   Mean POR - Mean monthly streamflow at the gaging station for period of
   record

   CFS - Abbreviation for cubic feet per second. One cubic foot is equal
   to approximately 7.5 gallons.
