                                SITE SUMMARY

     On June 10, 1999, a gasoline pipeline near Bellingham, Washington,
       owned by the Olympic Pipe Line Company ruptured and discharged
       approximately 277,000 gallons of gasoline into Hanna Creek and
     subsequently into Whatcom Creek, a three- to four-mile long coastal
    stream which runs through a city park, residential neighborhoods, and
     urban industrial areas before emptying into Bellingham Bay. As the
    gasoline was carried down the creek, the fumes were ignited, causing
    three human deaths and impacting a variety of natural resources along
                              the creeks path.
