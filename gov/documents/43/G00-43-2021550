     __________________________________________________________________

   NOAA's State of the Coast Report Web site is a robust, but technically
   simple Web offering that contains over 500 standard pages of text
   material, several hundred photographs and figures, streaming audio, and
   numerous appendices and downloadable files. Designing this site
   presented an array of difficult trade-offs to provide, insofar as
   possible, reasonable access time for users, a visually pleasing
   presentation, and useful printable products for those who do not like
   to read computer screens, while dealing with the production realities
   of voluminous material. As all Web designers know, these trade-offs are
   not easy choices, especially for the wide panorama of Web users.

   Have we made the right decisions for everyone? Most certainly not. We
   offer these helpful tips in the hope that they make your visit pleasant
   and productive. We suggest that readers planning to use the site
   several times print this page for reference. It will save time in the
   long run.

   Interspersed in the following discussion is "(recommended)." These are
   helpful options and operational tips that we believe will best suit
   most users.

   Your comments are always welcome and will be considered as we continue
   to evolve, remodel and enhance this site. Please e-mail your comments
   to Sotc.Webmaster@noaa.gov.

                                  Browsers
     __________________________________________________________________

   Browsers

   We have designed the entire site to be completely compatible with
   Netscape Navigator (v3.0 and above, recommended) or Microsoft Internet
   Explorer (v3.0 and above, recommended); however, other browsers can be
   used.

                                 Access time
     __________________________________________________________________

   Access Time

   Many pages on this site contain several photographs. The purpose of
   these photographs is to enhance the visual appeal of the page, both on
   the screen and as printed output. As with all images, however,
   downloading them to the browser can take time.

   These photographs are not necessary to understand the text of the
   essay; they are supplementary only. We suggest that users with slower
   modems or thinning patience, turn off automatic loading of images in
   their browsers (recommended). Because the length of most pages has
   deliberately been kept below 1,500 words, pages should load quickly
   with "images turned off." Note that all alternate labels for
   navigational buttons have been clearly labeled. This will allow
   navigating easily with images turned off.

   Fonts and Type Sizes

   All browsers allow users to select specific fonts and type sizes for
   display. Some users select large type sizes for ease of reading, or
   specific fonts for personal tastes. Most of the text in NOAA's State of
   the Coast is simply formatted and will not be adversely affected by a
   user's selection of fonts and type sizes, although the appearance of
   the document obviously will change. The major exceptions are the tables
   throughout the essays. Tables are, by their nature, rigidly formatted.
   Large type sizes and exotic fonts will significantly alter their
   appearance. The overall site has been designed around the default fonts
   used by the Netscape and Microsoft browsers identified above. Tables
   will show proper formatting by selecting a Times 12 point proportional
   font, and a Courier 10 point fixed font (recommended). Many other
   simple fonts at these sizes will work equally well.

   Printing Essays

   This Web site is text-based. The electronic revolution of the past
   decade has given us much, but unfortunately, there is still no pleasing
   way to read from a computer screen. Many Internet users, therefore,
   print out much of the material that they access for a more enjoyable
   reading experience.

   We have taken care to permit simple printing of these essays. First,
   each essay has been divided into 10 or 11 individual sections. Users
   can select a particular section (or sections) for quick printing. For
   easiest reading we recommend printing in portrait orientation at 85%
   size with printing of background patterns turned off (recommended).

     __________________________________________________________________

   Downloading Essays

   Download PDF Each essay will also be made available as a downloadable
   file in Portable Document Format (pdf). Initial comments from readers
   urged us to accelerate the development of these downloadable files. In
   response, we are providing files that are equivalent to the essay as it
   appears in a Browser.

   These downloadable essays are complete (save selected very large
   appendices) and contain all text, photos, tables and figures. This file
   can be accessed on microcomputers that have installed a recent version
   of Adobe Acrobat Reader. The essays are presented as single documents
   (for easy "one button" printing) in portrait style with a white
   background. Text can be extracted directly by simple "copy and paste"
   methods. We believe these files will satisfy most readers' needs. We
   recommend that readers wanting complete printed versions of the essays
   as single documents download these files.

   Users can download these files to their hard drives by selecting the
   "Download Essay" button from any page of an essay. Two file options
   (color or black and white) allow a simple choice between the appearance
   of the essay and file size.

   Backgrounds

   Many World Wide Web sites, including this one, use background patterns.
   Patterns can reduce eye strain, and provide a pleasing appearance for
   the page on the computer screen. But, reader's responses to background
   patterns will vary widely. All browsers can be set to disregard
   backgrounds, providing a clean surface. This setting is changed in the
   browsers' preferences which are accessible as a menu item.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Navigation

   Navigation through the site is straightforward. Users can reach most
   material directly from the Home Page or the Site Index (recommended).
   Both of these pages are accessible on every page of the site. Users
   planning multiple visits to the site should bookmark the Site Index
   (recommended) to obtain immediate access to all sections.

   Within an essay, navigation is by the list of access buttons that
   appears on the left of every page.

   Advanced Features

   This site uses two special features, RealAudio (streaming audio) and
   QuickTime (streaming video). Both pieces of software are described in
   the following paragraphs.

   RealAudio, used in the Expert Interpretation sections of the topic
   essays, requires RealPlayer (v.4.0 and above recommended). The
   application can be configured, when installing, to launch automatically
   from a browser. It is available without charge for most microcomputer
   platforms and operating systems. It can be downloaded at:

     http://www.real.com/products/player/index.html

   Detailed installation instructions are available with the downloaded
   product. Although there are text summaries of the comments of these
   experts, many readers will enjoy hearing the experts' actual voices
   (recommended).
     __________________________________________________________________

   QuickTime, used in the National Dialogues offering to view streaming
   video, requires the QuickTime plugin (v. 1 or 2 recommended) for your
   web browser. Although available for fewer operating systems, we found
   this format to provide superior quality for streaming video across the
   internet. It is available for Mac OS, Windows 3.1, Windows 95, and
   Windows NT. It can be downloaded without charge at:

     http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/index.html

   Do not be confused by the plugin versions listed above and the version
   of the QuickTime software available for download. Simply download the
   software for your particular platform and follow the instructions for
   installation. You will be prompted during installation for which
   internet browser(s) you would like the plugin installed. All versions
   of QuickTime available from this site will allow users to view the
   streaming and downloadable video from the National Dialogues site.

   The streamed video can be viewed on internet connections as low as
   28.8. Make sure tto read the installation instructions that allow users
   to specify their type of internet connection. For any questions, please
   use the email address listed below in 'About this Site'.
