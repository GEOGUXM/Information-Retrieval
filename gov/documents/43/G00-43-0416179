  History

   The original rule governing the DOE's Contractor Employee Protection
   Program was published in the Federal Register in 1992. In January 1998,
   the DOE proposed to amend the rule. An Interim Final Rule was published
   in the Federal Register on March 15, 1999. OHA amended the Interim
   Final Rule effective August 11, 1999. The amendment was published in
   the Federal Register on July 12, 1999. As noted above, the Final Rule
   was published in the Federal Register on February 9, 2000. The Final
   Rule is effective March 10, 2000. A technical correction to the Final
   Rule was published on February 23, 2000.
