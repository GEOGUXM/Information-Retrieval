   Los Alamos has a tradition of using external peer review to help
   management assess the quality of the Laboratory's science and
   technology. Such peer reviews have taken on added importance as a
   result of the most recent contracts between the UC and the Department
   of Energy (DOE) for management of Lawrence Berkeley, Lawrence
   Livermore, and Los Alamos National Laboratories. These DOE/UC contracts
   call for the laboratories to conduct annual Science and Technology
   Assessments. The STB-UC Team is responsible for ensuring that the
   Laboratory satisfies this requirement. The bulk of the input to the
   assessment is based on reviews conducted by 17 committees, one for each
   technical division. Our report, along with the administrative systems
   results (coordinated by the Laboratory's Quality and Planning Office)
   is submitted to the UCOP. The University submits the overall report to
   DOE which in turn uses this information as part of its assessment of
   the Laboratory. This assessment process has also provided UC with a
   more in-depth view of the capabilities of the laboratories it manages.
   This process has helped to strengthen the existing ties between the
   University and the laboratories and is fostering new relationships as
   well.
