       ENCROACHMENT PERMITS:
       The Encroachments and Relocations Section is responsible for
       overseeing statewide policy and procedure for Encroachment Permit
       activities along the State Water Project.  Some of these activities
       are construction of road improvements over pipelines; utility work,
       above or below the ground surface; commercial filming; and, certain
       types of farming activities.
       The use of any SWP right of way for nearly any purpose may require
       written authorization from the Department of Water Resources,
       regardless of whether the State owns fee title or easement only.
       This requirement is to ensure that the SWP facility is adequately
       protected during construction of any other improvements, and to
       ensure that the State's property rights and ability to operate and
       maintain its facilities are not infringed upon without the State's
       consent and concurrence.  Requests for ingress into the right of
       way requires the completion of an Encroachment Permit Application.
       It should also be noted that DWR must be notified of any pending
       subdivision of property within one mile of SWP facilities in
       accordance with Government Code 66455.1 to allow DWR the
       opportunity to evaluate potential effects of the proposed
       subdivision on SWP facilities, and to convey concerns to the local
       agency having jurisdiction for consideration in the tentative map
       approval process.  Even if your planned development does not fall
       within the requirements of  Government Code 66455.1,  but is within
       one mile of SWP facilities, it would be prudent to consider the
       potential effects of your project on SWP facilities and to consult
       with DWR if there appears to be even the slightest potential
       impact.
       For your convenience, we have made available online the
       Encroachment Permit Application form; the Standard Provisions form
       that will be a part of every Encroachment Permit issued; and, the
       latest version of our Encroachment Permit Guidelines for everyone
       to access directly.  If you would like these documents mailed to
       you instead, or if you would like to talk to someone about whether
       or not your planned activity will require an Encroachment Permit
       for work within SWP right of way, please call the toll free number

       UTILITY RELOCATIONS:
       Our Section is also responsible for ensuring that the right of way
       for any SWP or Reclamation Board project is clear of utility
       facilities that would be in conflict with the proposed construction
       or subsequent operation of the facility.  We take care of that by
       working directly with the affected utility owners to have the
       utilities either removed entirely, or relocated to a suitable
       location to accommodate the project.  If removal/relocation is not
       possible, arrangements are made to protect the utility in place.
