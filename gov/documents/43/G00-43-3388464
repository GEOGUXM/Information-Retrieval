                                Warm Climates

                      Variability - Extremes - Impacts
          ________________________________________________________

   Past global warmings provide insights to future climates.

   This project is investigating millennial- and submillennial-scale
   climate variability during the recent past and older intervals of warm
   climates to provide background information on the patterns, rates and
   magnitudes, and impacts of likely future natural or human-induced
   climate change.
