                            FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

                               March 29, 1996

                                 FACT SHEET
                    U.S. GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM POLICY

   The President has approved a comprehensive national policy on the
   future management and use of the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS)
   and related U.S. Government augmentations.

    Background

   The Global Positioning System (GPS) was designed as a dual-use system
   with the primary purpose of enhancing the effectiveness of U.S. and
   allied military forces. GPS provides a substantial military advantage
   and is now being integrated into virtually every facet of our military
   operations. GPS is also rapidly becoming an integral component of the
   emerging Global Information Infrastructure, with applications ranging
   from mapping and surveying to international air traffic management and
   global change research. The growing demand from military, civil,
   commercial, and scientific users has generated a U.S. commercial GPS
   equipment and service industry that leads the world. Augmentations to
   enhance basic GPS services could further expand these civil and
   commercial markets.

   The basic GPS is defined as the constellation of satellites, the
   navigation payloads which produce the GPS signals, ground stations,
   data links, and associated command and control facilities which are
   operated and maintained by the Department of Defense; the Standard
   Positioning Service (SPS) as the civil and commercial service provided
   by the basic GPS; and augmentations as those systems based on the GPS
   that provide real-time accuracy greater than the SPS.

   This policy presents a strategic vision for the future management and
   use of GPS, addressing a broad range of military, civil, commercial,
   and scientific interests, both national and international.

    Policy Goals

   In the management and use of GPS, we seek to support and enhance our
   economic competitiveness and productivity while protecting U.S.
   national security and foreign policy interests.

   Our goals are to:
    1. Strengthen and maintain our national security.
    2. Encourage acceptance and integration of GPS into peaceful civil,
       commercial and scientific applications worldwide.
    3. Encourage private sector investment in and use of U.S. GPS
       technologies and services.
    4. Promote safety and efficiency in transportation and other fields.
    5. Promote international cooperation in using GPS for peaceful
       purposes.
    6. Advance U.S. scientific and technical capabilities.

    Policy Guidelines

   We will operate and manage GPS in accordance with the following
   guidelines:
    1. We will continue to provide the GPS Standard Positioning Service
       for peaceful civil, commercial and scientific use on a continuous,
       worldwide basis, free of direct user fees.
    2. It is our intention to discontinue the use of GPS Selective
       Availability (SA) within a decade in a manner that allows adequate
       time and resources for our military forces to prepare fully for
       operations without SA. To support such a decision, affected
       departments and agencies will submit recommendations in accordance
       with the reporting requirements outlined in this policy.
    3. The GPS and U.S. Government augmentations will remain responsive to
       the National Command Authorities.
    4. We will cooperate with other governments and international
       organizations to ensure an appropriate balance between the
       requirements of international civil, commercial and scientific
       users and international security interests.
    5. We will advocate the acceptance of GPS and U.S. Government
       augmentations as standards for international use.
    6. To the fullest extent feasible, we will purchase commercially
       available GPS products and services that meet U.S. Government
       requirements and will not conduct activities that preclude or deter
       commercial GPS activities, except for national security or public
       safety reasons.
    7. A permanent interagency GPS Executive Board, jointly chaired by the
       Departments of Defense and Transportation, will manage the GPS and
       U.S. Government augmentations. Other departments and agencies will
       participate as appropriate. The GPS Executive Board will consult
       with U.S. Government agencies, U.S. industries and foreign
       governments involved in navigation and positioning system research,
       development, operation, and use.

   This policy will be implemented within the overall resource and policy
   guidance provided by the President.

    Agency Roles and Responsibilities

   The Department of Defense will:
    1. Continue to acquire, operate, and maintain the basic GPS.
    2. Maintain a Standard Positioning Service (as defined in the Federal
       Radionavigation Plan and the GPS Standard Positioning Service
       Signal Specification) that win be available on a continuous,
       worldwide basis.
    3. Maintain a Precise Positioning Service for use by the U.S. military
       and other authorized users.
    4. Cooperate with the Director of Central Intelligence, the Department
       of State and other appropriate departments and agencies to assess
       the national security implications of the use of GPS, its
       augmentations, and alternative satellite-based positioning and
       navigation systems.
    5. Develop measures to prevent the hostile use of GPS and its
       augmentations to ensure that the United States retains a military
       advantage without unduly disrupting or degrading civilian uses.

   The Department of Transportation will:
    1. Serve as the lead agency within the U.S. Government for all Federal
       civil GPS matters.
    2. Develop and implement U.S. Government augmentations to the basic
       GPS for transportation applications.
    3. In cooperation with the Departments of Commerce, Defense and State,
       take the lead in promoting commercial applications of GPS
       technologies and the acceptance of GPS and U.S. Government
       augmentations as standards in domestic and international
       transportation systems.
    4. In cooperation with other departments and agencies, coordinate U.S.
       Government-provided GPS civil augmentation systems to minimize cost
       and duplication of effort.

   The Department of State will:
    1. In cooperation with appropriate departments and agencies, consult
       with foreign governments and other international organizations to
       assess the feasibility of developing bilateral or multilateral
       guidelines on the provision and use of GPS services.
    2. Coordinate the interagency review of instructions to U.S.
       delegations to bilateral consultations and multilateral conferences
       related to the planning, operation, management, and use of GPS and
       related augmentation systems.
    3. Coordinate the interagency review of international agreements with
       foreign governments and international organizations concerning
       international use of GPS and related augmentation systems.

    Reporting Requirements

   Beginning in 2000, the President will make an annual determination on
   continued use of GPS Selective Availability. To support this
   determination, the Secretary of Defense, in cooperation with the
   Secretary of Transportation, the Director of Central Intelligence, and
   heads of other appropriate departments and agencies, shall provide an
   assessment and recommendation on continued SA use. This recommendation
   shall be provided to the President through the Assistant to the
   President for National Security Affairs and the Assistant to the
   President for Science and Technology.
