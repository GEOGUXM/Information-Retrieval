   Question:
   12. What is RACER?

   Answer:

                 Internet Access to Selected Court Documents

   The United States District Court for the Eastern District of California
   is pleased to announce the capability to view selected court documents
   via the internet. The new service is called RACER and is similiar to
   the existing text only based service called PACER.
   A PACER login and password are required and you can access both
   services using the same login and password. If you already have a PACER
   login you can begin using the RACER system immediately. If you need a
   PACER login you can obtain one by calling the Pacer Service Center at:
   (800) 676-6856.
   You can reach our RACER/PACER sites on the internet at:
