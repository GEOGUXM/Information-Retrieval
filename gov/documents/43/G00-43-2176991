   What are nonindigenous aquatic species?
     __________________________________________________________________

   We define nonindigenous aquatic species as a member(s) (i.e.
   individual, group, or population) of a species that enters a body of
   water or aquatic ecosystem outside of its historic or native range.
   Most of the nonindigenous introductions are a result of human
   activities since the European colonization of North America. This
   includes not only species that arrived from outside of North America,
   which are commonly referred to as exotics, but also species native to
   North America that have been introduced to drainages outside their
   native ranges within the country. An example of the former would be the
   Brown Trout, Salmo trutta, a native of Europe first imported to the
   United States in 1883 from Germany. An example of the latter would be
   the Coho Salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, a native to the Pacific coast
   from northern California to Alaska, which was introduced into the Great
   Lakes as early as the 1920's.
   The importance of studying nonindigenous organisms is to learn what
   effects they may have on the native organisms and the physical
   environment.
