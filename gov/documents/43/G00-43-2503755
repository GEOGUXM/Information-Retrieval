                                 Objectives

   The purpose of the Technology Transfer University Competition is to
   accelerate the process of commercialization of new products and
   services based on advanced scientific research. By shifting the
   emphasis toward the applications of rapidly emerging or newly
   discovered technologies, it is possible to generate a greater number
   and diversity of potential uses across a wider range of disciplines.

   The selection of university students as the primary catalyst in this
   process is designed to capitalize on their limitless enthusiasm,
   willingness to take chances, and unbounded pure creativity.

   Providing scientific knowledge and entrepreneurial opportunities can
   stimulate an entire generation of undergraduate and graduate students
   who participate in this competition at Argonne National Laboratory
   to look well beyond tomorrow and take the initiative to start designing
   the future today.
