   ARTICLE C.1 BACKGROUND

   The Neural Prosthesis Program (NPP) of The National Institute of
   Neurological Disorders and Stroke is committed to the development of
   safe, reliable, and effective systems for functional neuromuscular
   stimulation (FNS) in spinal cord injured individuals. Multiple
   implantable microstimulators which selectively stimulate paralyzed
   muscles in a controlled fashion may permit an individual to use his or
   her own muscles as the motors to produce limb movement. Multiple
   implantable microtransducers that sense contact, grasp force, and limb
   position from either implanted transducers or intact sensory receptors
   may provide sensory feedback from an otherwise insensate limb. To
   produce a useful system, these sensory and motor prostheses are being
   developed together as standard and compatible building blocks of an
   integrated FNS system.

   The NPP is supporting research and development of a system consisting
   of an extracorporeal coil and a family of implantable microstimulators
   and microtransducers (Loeb et. al., Injectable microstimulator for
   functional electrical stimulation., Med. & Biol. Eng. & Comput.
   29:NS13-NS19, 1991; Troyk and Schwan, Closed-loop class E
   transcutaneous power and data link for microimplants., IEEE Trans. on
   BME 39:589-599, 1992). The system is designed to power and control up
   to 64 individual transducers and stimulators through a single external
   coil. During the past five years significant progress has been made in
   developing addressable, implantable microstimulators and an
   extracorporeal coil and transmission system. This work has progressed
   to the point where first generation devices are available for
   implantation. Work was also begun during the past 2 years on the
   development of implantable addressable transducers. This contract will
   continue the engineering development of the microstimulators and
   transducers. In addition, in-vivo evaluation of these devices will be
   initiated in an animal model.

   This RFP represents a competitive renewal of an ongoing contract.
   Copies of progress reports from current contracts related to this work
   and a bibliography of Neural Prosthesis Program publications are
   available from the Contracts Management Branch, Room 901 Federal Bldg.,

   ARTICLE C.2. STATEMENT OF WORK

   Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor
   shall exert its best efforts to develop and test a system for
   functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) consisting of implantable
   receiver-stimulators and transducer-telemeters and an easily donned
   extracorporeal transmitter.

   Specifically, the Contractor shall:

   A. Design, fabricate, and test implantable receiver-stimulators,
   implantable transducer-telemeters, and an extracorporeal transmitter
   for FNS.

   1. The implantable receiver-stimulators, consisting of power receiver,
   control receiver, stimulus and control circuitry, electrodes, and
   encapsulation shall meet the following specifications:

   a. They shall be made as small as possible while still being compatible
   with the other requirements described below. The target volume of each
   stimulator shall be 60 cubic mm or less.

   b. An individual stimulator shall initiate a stimulus pulse only in
   response to a properly addressed command from the transmitter. There
   shall be at least 64 different stimulator addresses that can be
   selected.

   c. The stimulators shall derive their power and commands by an
   inductive link from a transmitter coil with field specifications as
   outlined below.

   d. The stimulus current waveform shall have two phases of opposite
   polarity. The duration of the first phase shall be variable from 0 to
   200 microseconds in at least 200 steps on a pulse by pulse basis.

   e. The stimulus current level of the first phase of a stimulus pulse
   shall be adjustable and shall include levels of 1 and 10 milliamps
   under control of the transmitter. The current of the second phase shall
   guarantee long term charge balance at the electrodes under all pulsing
   conditions within specifications. Stimulator compliance voltage shall
   be at least 10 volts.

   f. Stimulating electrodes shall be made of corrosion resistant and
   biocompatible materials (e.g. platinum, platinum-iridium, iridium, or
   tantalum pentoxide) and shall be stable in physiologic saline at 37
   degrees C for at least 1 year at the maximum charge delivery rate.

   g. The stimulator shall be encapsulated in a manner that permits stable
   operation in physiologic saline at 37 degrees C for at least 1 year
   with materials that are known to be biocompatible.

   2. The implantable transducer-telemeters consisting of transduction
   unit, power receiver, control circuitry, digitizer, telemetry
   circuitry, and encapsulation shall meet the following specifications:

   a. The transducer-telemeters shall not interfere with the operation of
   the receiver-stimulators and vice-versa.

   b. The transducer-telemeter package shall occupy a volume of no more
   than 125 cubic mm (not including magnets, electrodes, or other passive
   elements which can be external to the package if they are needed for
   the design). Biocompatibility and life expectancy shall be as specified
   for the microstimulator in part 1.

   c. The transducer-telemeters shall derive power and commands from the
   same transmitter coil as the microstimulators and shall transmit
   information to this coil upon command.

   d. The transducer-telemeters shall be addressable with at least 64
   unique addresses using an addressing scheme that is compatible with the
   microstimulator addressing.

   e. The telemeter's digitizing and telemetry circuits shall be designed
   to provide at least 8 bits of digital data per sample. Signal
   conditioning for sensing biopotentials suitable for closed-loop control
   and/or sensory feedback shall be incorporated in telemeters with
   addresses 1 through 16.

   f. A joint angle transducer-telemeter shall be designed to provide
   wrist joint angle information for use as a command signal with a
   resolution of at least 5 degree as the wrist moves through its
   physiological range of flexion and extension. The error of angle
   measurement (including drift, hysteresis, and errors due to wrist
   movement other than pure flexion and extension) shall not exceed 15
   degrees.

   3. The extracorporeal transmitter shall meet the following
   specifications:

   a. The transmitter field shall permit specified operation of the
   stimulators and transducers anywhere within a cylindrical shaped volume
   of physiologic saline at least 9 cm. in diameter and at least 16.0 cm
   in length.

   b. The transmitter field shall permit specified operation with up to 10
   degrees of axial misalignment between the transmitter coil and the
   receiver coils in the stimulators and transducers.

   c. The transmitter, under the control of a computer, shall be capable
   of powering and controlling at least 64 stimulators and/or transducers
   in any combination.

   d. The transmitter coil shall be designed to be donned and doffed as
   easily as an item of clothing.

   e. The transmitter shall operate reliably in the presence of
   electromagnetic interference commonly found in a home or work
   environment.

   4. The Contractor shall make its best effort to deliver to the Project
   Officer one set of 32 receiver-stimulators each with a different
   address, one set of 4 joint angle transducer-telemeters each with a
   different address, and one transmitter with specifications as outlined
   above by the end of the contract period.

   B. Select a suitable animal model and evaluate implanted
   microstimulators in this animal model.

   1. Evaluate the tissue reaction to implanted stimulators placed
   intramuscularly and subdermally for periods of at least 3 months.

   a. Evaluate the tissue reaction to active and inactive devices.

   b. Evaluate the tissue reaction to any components used in making the
   device that might be exposed to tissue should the encapsulation fail.

   2. Investigate the threshold stability and motor recruitment stability
   of microstimulators over a period of at least 3 months.

   3. Investigate the function of implanted transducer-telemeters over a
   period of at least 3 months.

   C. Cooperate with other investigators in the Neural Prosthesis Program
   to integrate this work into practical FNS systems.
