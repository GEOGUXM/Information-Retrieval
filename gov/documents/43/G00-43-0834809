   Research Interests:

   We are interested in describing at the molecular level the infection of
   human cells by adenovirus. Over 40 serologically distinct adenoviruses
   have been characterized, and these infect cells in a variety of
   tissues, including the upper respiratory tract, the conjunctiva and the
   gastrointestinal tract.

   Currently we are studying the cellular receptors that promote infection
   to determine if receptor choice governs tissue tropism, and what role,
   if any, the receptor plays in transport of the non-enveloped adenovirus
   capsid across cell membranes. We demonstrated that adenovirus serotypes
   2 and 12, which infect the upper respiratory tract and the
   gastrointestinal tract, respectively, share the same attachment
   receptor; these results imply that factors other than receptor choice
   may govern tissure tropism.

   Recently, we transferred the adenovirus attachment receptor gene into
   cultured mouse cells, and we are now using these cells to isolate the
   receptor gene.
