   BICYCLES AND AIR QUALITY
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Air District is a strong proponent of cycling, not just for
   recreation, but also for commuting and other daily activities, as a
   means to reduce motor vehicle travel. This page provides an overview of
   the Air District's efforts to promote cycling, as well as links to
   other useful bicycle resources. We encourage you to ride - and please
   be sure to wear a helmet and ride safely!

    Why Ride a Bicycle?

   The bicycle is the ultimate clean air, zero emissions vehicle. Bikes
   are practical, economical, low-maintenance, and non-polluting. Cycling
   is a fast and practical way to get around town, especially in the Bay
   Area where the climate is favorable to cycling most of the year. Plus,
   riding a bike is fun and a great form of exercise.

The Environmental Benefits of Bicycling

   Bikes are a very environmentally friendly means of transportation. No
   tailpipe emissions, no evaporative emissions, no emissions from
   gasoline pumping or oil refining, zero carbon dioxide or other
   greenhouse gases that contribute to the global warming problem.

   Bicycling also means less water pollution (many people don't realize
   that motor vehicles are a significant source of water pollution as well
   as air pollution). And bikes are quiet, so they don't contribute to
   noise pollution.

    Cycling to Reduce Motor Vehicle Trips and Emissions

   Vehicle emissions are the major cause of air pollution in the Bay Area.
   Motor vehicles are responsible for the roughly 75% of the smog (ozone
   pollution) in the Bay Area (including tailpipe emissions and
   evaporative emissions, plus emissions from oil refining and gasoline
   pumping).

   Cycling can play an important role in improving air quality in the Bay
   Area. According to the 1990 National Personal Transportation Survey,
   40% of all trips are two miles or less, and two-thirds are five miles
   or less. Bicycles are a convenient means of transportation for these
   short and medium distance trips. Although many people enjoy riding
   bikes for recreation, only a small fraction of Bay Area residents (less
   than 2%) commute by bicycle. There's tremendous potential to expand the
   use of bicycles as practical transportation for commuting, shopping,
   trips to school, and errands.

    Cycling for Short Trips to Reduce Cold Start Emissions

   Even short motor vehicle trips are a significant source of emissions
   due to the "cold start" problem. There's a high rate of emissions
   during the first few miles of driving because the catalytic converter
   does not function well for the first couple minutes after a car is
   first started. Cycling for short trips helps to reduce these "cold
   start" vehicle emissions. Riding a bike to the bus stop or transit
   station (BART, Caltrain, or the ferry) is one good way to reduce cold
   start emissions.

Bicycling and the Bay Area Clean Air Plan

   The Air District, in collaboration with the Metropolitan Transportation
   Commission (MTC) and the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG),
   has developed a Clean Air Plan to help the region comply with state air
   quality standards. The Bay Area Clean Air Plan contains a variety of
   transportation control measures (TCMs) to reduce motor vehicle travel
   by promoting the use of transit, carpooling and vanpooling, and
   bicycling and walking. TCM #5 promotes better access to transit and
   ferry terminals by biking and walking. TCM #9 includes a variety of
   measures to promote bicycle access and safe cycling conditions
   throughout the Bay Area transportation system.

Air District Funding for Bicycle Projects

   The Air District provides funding for bicycle facility projects through
   the Transportation Fund for Clean Air (TFCA) program. The TFCA program
   awards grants to public agencies for a wide range projects to promote
   alternative forms of transportation and clean air vehicles. The TFCA
   program focuses on funding physical bicycle improvements with a high
   potential to improve bike access to transit stations, employment
   centers, shopping districts, and schools and colleges. Eligible bicycle
   projects include:
     * on-road bicycle lanes (Class 2)
     * on-road bicycle routes (Class 1)
     * bicycle paths and trails (Class 3)
     * bicycle racks on transit buses
     * bicycle racks and lockers
     * attended bicycle parking facilities

   From 1996 the year 2000, the TFCA program provided over $21 million in
   funding for bicycle projects throughout the Bay Area. The TFCA program
   has helped to fund:
     * 159 miles of on-street bicycle lanes (Class 2 facilities)
     * 86 miles of on-street bicycle routes (Class 3 facilities)
     * 51 miles of off-street bicycle paths or trails (Class 1 facilities)
     * 1,180 bicycle lockers at transit stations and other activity
       centers
     * 2,470 on-street bicycle racks
     * 1,200 bicycle racks on transit buses
     * Attended bicycle parking facilities at the Palo Alto Caltrain
       station and the downtown Berkeley BART station

Bike to Work Day

   California celebrates Bike to Work Day every year in the month of May.
   RIDES for Bay Area Commuters is the regional coordinator for Bike to
   Work Day. Visit the Bike to Work Day page on the RIDES website at
   www.rides.org. You can register to win prizes, purchase T-shirts and
   gear, get a list of Energizer Stations in your community, or get more
   information and resources about bike commuting. If you've never
   commuted by bike, Bike to Work Day is a great time to try it. Talk to
   your employer or school about sponsoring a BTWD event. Make every day
   bike to work day!

Bicycle Safety

   The League of American Bicyclists offers an Effective Cycling program
   to teach the skills required for safe and effective on-road cycling.

    Local Bicycle Plans

   Most cities and counties have adopted local bike plans that include
   bicycle route networks and specified bicycle facility improvement
   projects. Contact the planning or public works department of your city
   or county for information on the local bicycle plan.

   The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) is in the process of
   developing a Regional Bicycle Plan for the Bay Area. For information,
