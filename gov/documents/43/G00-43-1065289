   California's Energy Challenge

   Flex Your Power California continues to experience electrical
   shortages. To reduce the risk of power outages, the most important
   thing you can do is reduce your demand for electricity and use energy
   more efficiently.

   California has the power of the world's sixth largest economy. Your
   individual efforts, multiplied by 35 million Californians, will make a
   real and immediate difference.

                    All you have to do is FLEX YOUR POWER
