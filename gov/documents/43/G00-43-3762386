                      Asymmetry Analysis Collaboration
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Asymmetry Analysis Collaboration (AAC) is a working group on polarized
   parton distribution functions (Pol-PDF) formed by theorists and
   experimentalists. The purpose of the working group is to study current
   constraints on the Pol-PDF and suggest future measurements for better
   determination of the Pol-PDF.
