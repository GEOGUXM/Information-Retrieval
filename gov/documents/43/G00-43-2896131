      Flying high, flying safe:
      AFF mitigates risk and safely exceeds mission goals

      By Jay Levine
      X-Press Editor

      Two Dryden research aircraft are showing they can save fuel and reduce
      drag by flying like birds do - in formation.

      Autonomous Formation Flight (AFF) missions flown by F/A-18 aircraft
      have shown in about 40 research flights substantial fuel savings of up
      to 20 percent, high accuracy during autopilot-controlled formation
      flight and excellence in identifying and mitigating risks to fly the
      missions safely.

      "It is very important to take the time at the very beginning of the
      project and structure the project in such a fashion so that you can
      identify and mitigate all the risks the project has in terms of not
      just safety, but also technical and programmatic risks," Project
      Manager Gerard Schkolnik said.

      "It follows in the philosophy of design it out. Design out the risks.
      Don't show up in the end game when every-thing is all built, designed
      and ready to go fly and say 'whoops, here is something we just
      completely overlooked.' I think one of the real successes of the AFF
      Project is the way that the team got together at the very beginning and
      laid out the project and structured it to identify the key risks. We
      structured the project to systematically mitigate those risks," he
      said.

   19 percent for the trailing aircraft.

      The two main risks identified early in the project were the potential
      for a mid-air collision when the planes are flown as close as 20 feet
      apart at high speeds. The second risk is the possibility of
      overstressing the aircraft structure should the research autopilot
      command large deflections of the control surfaces, explained Brent
      Cobleigh, AFF chief engineer. Those hazards were identified the way
      most projects begin assessing risks - a brainstorming session.

      Three approaches are used to mitigate risk. First, the potential hazard
      is assessed to see if it can be designed out of the system. For
      example, more stringent tests were conducted on the hardware systems
      that constitute the AFF autopilot to avoid potential issues in flight.

      A second way of mitigating risk is through automated warning and
      caution systems. This type of system automatically disengages the AFF
      systems if the distance between the two aircraft closes to within 56
      feet from the nose of the trail aircraft to the tail of the lead
      aircraft.

      The third level of mitigating risk is by procedures and training in the
      sky and in simulators. The control room also plays a critical role in
      safety by monitoring a number of factors such as the trailing
      aircraft's airspeed or severe oscillations. In cases like those, the
      pilot could be instructed to disengage the autopilot.

      Multiple layers are built in to protect the pilots and project. For
      example, electronics monitor the "heart beat" from all the autopilot
      computers 20 times a second. If the system detects a change, it
      automatically disengages.

      Another layer of safety is a pilot in the cockpit. They have visual
      information about the nose to tail distance and the pilot in the
      trailing aircraft can either push a button to manually disengage
      systems, or move the stick more than a half inch, which automatically
      disengages the system so that the pilot can regain control of the
      aircraft.

      Risk reduction has been a big part of project preparations. AFF
      relative position sensor systems were first researched on cars at El
      Mirage, Calif., in July 2000. UCLA prototype sensors were used on cars
      driving along close together to confirm the precision of the data,
      Schkolnik said.

      The Formation Flight Information System (FFIS) is an advanced GPS
      system capable of computing the relative distance and velocity between
      two moving aircraft to an accuracy of 1 foot. Dryden's standard GPS
      receivers were tested in 2000 on antennas attached to the NASA King
      Air. The tests confirmed recent changes concerning GPS signals had
      yielded accuracy that was 10 times greater than before.

      "We took the concept of a build-up approach and applied it to each
      aspect of the program before going into a hazardous situation,"
      Schkolnik said.

      The aircraft initially were kept at distances of 100 feet to 200 feet
      to avoid any potential risks in the early stages of the program. The
      project also used what is called a Class B envelope - an airspeed of no
      more than 250 knots - to mitigate any potential danger to the aircraft
      from any errant autopilot inputs.

      "Overstress of an aircraft is always a possibility if research software
      sends an errant command to the flight control box. That is a hazard
      Dryden has a lot of experience mitigating," Schkolnik said.

      Steven Jacobson, lead controls engineer, said the AFF software also
      provided many challenges.

      "The most unique aspect of the design was developing technology to
      design a control system that operates in the vortex. The system is able
      to keep itself in the correct position while counteracting the effects
      of the vortex," Jacobson said.

      Mapping the vortex, or the swirling air that comes from the lead
      aircraft, is what researchers concluded in December research flights.
      One find was that the vortex energy does not dissipate quickly.
      However, while the best area in the vortex can provide fuel savings,
      drag reduction and fewer emissions, other areas of the vortex create
      turbulence.

      When a project is confident that it is ready to fly, Dryden's Chief
      Engineer Marta Bohn-Meyer selects a group of experts from each
      discipline for the first flight readiness review board known as the
      Dryden Independent Review. The group looks at all elements of the
      project, asks questions and makes recommendations, Cobleigh said.

      That peer team then goes to Dryden's Airworthiness and Flight Safety
      Review Board with recommendations to fly or not, and any requirements
      or questions that need to be resolved before the project can move on to
      the next steps to flight.

      The airworthiness board issues a letter containing any conditions on
      the flight, or items to be resolved before a flight is permitted. A
      tech brief, which identifies what the project will do and how it will
      operate on the research missions, is the last step. A tech brief can
      cover one flight or a block of similar flights. An anomaly or hardware
      problem requires another tech brief on what occurred and what will be
      changed for the next flight. A mini tech brief is required if minor
      modifications or test point changes are needed between flights. The
      whole process takes about a month, or more depending on the project's
      complexity.

      If there are major changes, the project must re-enter the flight
      readiness process. Small changes or fixes don't require more than a
      tech brief or mini tech brief. Some times tech briefs only approve one
      or two flights to see how it is going before allowing a block of
      flights, Cobleigh said.

      Dryden had many partners in the AFF research. Langley Research Center,
      Hampton, Va., assisted in quantifying fuel savings and emissions
      reductions, UCLA's Autonomous Technology Instrumentation Lab developed
      sensor software and prototype sensor hardware.

      Boeing St. Louis researchers worked on flight control computer software
      development. And the Formation Flight Control System autopilot box was
      developed by UCLA and repackaged by The Boeing Company to fly on the
      research F/A-18s.
