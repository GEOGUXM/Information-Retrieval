   The Miami Community Outreach Program is interested in impacting our
   local communities. We feel that this can be accomplished through
   efforts including the Junior Special Agent Program, Career Days, Office
   Tours, and assisting local community coalitions in their duties. Give
   us the opportunity to work with you and together we can make a
   difference. Requests in the above listed areas should be addressed to
   the Community Outreach Specialist:
