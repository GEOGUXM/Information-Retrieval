  [world.gif] NOAA Aeronomy Laboratory TRMM Field Campaigns

   [bluebar.gif]

   The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is a joint space project
   between NASA and the National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of
   Japan. TRMM is designed to determine the climatology of tropical
   precipitation, including its vertical structure as well as its
   horizontal distribution.

   One of the greatest challenges standing in the way of reliable
   numerical model simulations of the global climate is knowing when the
   model gets the correct hydrological cycle. This requires a knowledge of
   the correct distribution of latent heating associated with tropical
   rainfall. The release of latent heat in tropical rainfall is one of the
   principal energy sources driving the atmospheric general circulation.

   The NOAA Aeronomy Laboratory is working closely with the NASA TRMM
   Science Team to provide ground truth for TRMM using Doppler radar wind
   profilers. This research is taking place primarily within the TRMM
   Field Campaigns that are part of the TRMM Global Validation Program.
   Four major Field Campaigns are planned during TRMM:
     * TEFLUN A - South Texas, April-June 1998
     * TEFLUN B - Central Florida, August-September 1998
     * TRMM-LBA - Rondonia Province, Brazil, January-February 1999
     * KWAJEX - Kwajalein, July - September 1999
