     Of particular interest to IT Vendors
     Information Technology (IT) vendors may be particularly interested in
     the following NIST security programs and services. These are grouped
     by: 1) security specifications, 2) security testing 3) security
     education and 4) research.

   Security Specifications
     * Cryptographic Standards - NIST is involved in the development,
       maintenance, and promotion of a number of standards and guidance
       that cover a wide range of cryptographic technology. As NIST
       develops new standards, recommendations, and guidance, they are
       included in a comprehensive Cryptographic Standards Toolkit to
       protect the data, communications, and operations. The toolkit
       currently includes a wide variety of cryptographic algorithms and
       techniques, and more will be added in the future. The standards
       included have been approved and are recommended to protect
       sensitive Federal information, but may also be used by anyone else
       on a voluntary basis. The Cryptographic Standards Toolkit includes
       the following categories: Guidance, Encryption, Modes of Operation,
       Digital Signatures, Secure Hashing, Key Management, Random Number
       Generation, Message Authentication, Entity Authentication, and
       Password Usage and Generation. Contact: Elaine Barker.
     * Cryptographic Module Security - In addition to specific
       cryptographic security specifications, a wider range of security
       specifications for cryptographic modules and IT products are
       available. Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules covers
       11 areas related to the design and implementation of a
       cryptographic module. Protection of a cryptographic module within a
       security system is necessary to maintain the confidentiality and
       integrity of the information protected by the module. The standard
       provides four increasing, qualitative levels of security intended
       to cover a wide range of potential applications and environments.
       Cryptographic modules can then be tested to verify that they
       conform to these specifications under the Cryptographic Module
       Validation Program, discussed below: Ray Snouffer.
     * Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation
       (ISO/IEC 15408) specifications - The Common Criteria provides a
       methodology for developing security specifications for IT products.
       These specifications are known as "protection profiles" and
       "security targets." They are then used as the basis for the
       evaluation of security properties of IT products and systems via
       the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), described
       below. Contact: Ron Ross
     * PKI - The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is
       taking a leadership role in the development of a Federal Public Key
       Infrastructure that supports digital signatures and other public
       key-enabled security services. NIST is coordinating with industry
       and technical groups developing PKI technology to foster
       interoperability of PKI products and projects. In support of
       digital signatures, NIST has worked with the Federal PKI Steering
       Committee to produce digital signature guidance. NIST is currently
       concentrating on PKI architectures, security requirements for PKI
       components, and PKI-enabled applications. The PKI architecture work
       is divided between development of complex PKIs based on the bridge
       CA concept and theoretical modeling of PKI performance. The goal of
       NIST's security requirements work is a Common Criteria Protection
       Profile. Contact: Tim Polk

   Security Testing
     * The National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) - NIAP is a
       collaboration between the National Institute of Standards and
       Technology (NIST) and the National Security Agency (NSA) in
       fulfilling their respective responsibilities under the Computer
       Security Act of 1987. Private-sector laboratories are currently
       accredited as competent under the National Voluntary Laboratory
       Accreditation Program (NVLAP) to conduct these evaluations. Each
       evaluation is conducted against a set of security specifications
       provided to the laboratory by the sponsor of the evaluation. Once
       the evaluation is successfully completed, a certificate is issued
       and the product is placed on the NIAP Validated Products list. NIST
       has also led development of an international "Mutual Recognition
       Arrangement" (MRA) with more than ten international partners
       (including Canada, Germany, U.K., and France) so that successful
       evaluations accomplished in the US are recognized by the MRA
       partners. NIAP also works with users and vendors to develop
       security specifications for specific technologies (e.g., Smart Card
       Forum) or technology application areas (e.g., Healthcare Forum).
       Contact: Ron Ross
     * The Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) - CMVP, jointly
       led by NIST and the Government of Canada's Communications Security
       Establishment, provides for the voluntary testing of cryptographic
       modules (both hardware and software). Private-sector laboratories,
       which have been accredited as competent under NVLAP, conduct these
       validations. Testing is conducted against the security
       specifications detailed in Security Requirements for Cryptographic
       Modules. Testing is also conducted to help assure the correct
       implementation of specific cryptographic algorithms approved to
       protect sensitive information in the Federal government. Once the
       validation is successfully completed, a certificate is issued and
       the product is placed on the Cryptographic Module Validation List.

     * IPsec Interoperability Testing - Following a need expressed in the
       IETF for an Interoperability Test System for the Internet Security
       Protocol (IPsec) and its associated key negotiation protocol
       (Internet Key Exchange, or IKE), NIST developed an interactive
       Web-based IPsec tester. The tester, IPsec-WIT, is based on Cerberus
       and PlutoPlus, NIST's reference implementations of IPsec and IKE.
       It enables vendors to spontaneously test their IPsec and IKE
       implementations at any time and from any location. The
       implementations, and the tester, currently exploit IPV4, but the
       intention is to provide an IPV6 version soon, at which time both
       versions of the tester will be available in parallel. Contact:
       Sheila Frankel

   Security Education
     * International Common Criteria Conference - NIST and its
       international partners annually holds the International Common
       Criteria Conference, which draws attendance from user
       organizations, IT vendors and testing labs. The purpose of the
       conference is to further use and understanding of the Common
       Criteria. The conference helps ensure that not only do we have
       truly global standards for certifying commercial software products,
       but that these bring real benefits for both commercial suppliers
       and end users in both government and the public sector. Contact:
       Peggy Himes
     * Common Criteria Training Courses - NIST's NIAP offers training
       courses in the Common Criteria (ISO 15408) to educate producers and
       consumers of information technology (IT) products and systems about
       the Common Criteria, Common Evaluation Methodology, and the Common
       Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme. Contact: Peggy Himes
     * Computer Security Resource Center - This site contains information
       about a variety of computer security issues, products, and research
       of concern to Federal agencies, industry, and users. This site is
       operated and maintained by NIST's Computer Security Division as a
       service to the computer security and IT community. Contact: John
       Wack

   Research
     * Critical Infrastructure Protection Research Grants Program - This
       grants program, administered by NIST, funds research in high
       priority areas, which are not being adequately addressed elsewhere.
       NIST publishes a call for proposals annually. Grants may be for
       multi-year work. Contact: Don Marks
     * Guest research internships at NIST - Opportunities are available at
       NIST for 6 to 24 month long internships at NIST in the security
       program. Qualified individuals should contact the Computer Security
       Division and provide a statement of qualifications and indicate the
       area of work that is of interest. Generally speaking, the salary
       costs are borne by the sponsoring institution; however, in some
       cases, these guest research internships carry a small monthly
       stipend paid by NIST. Contact: Ed Roback
