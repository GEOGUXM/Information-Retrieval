Simulations of Dense Plasmas
     __________________________________________________________________

   A dense plasma forms a peculiar media, exhibiting features of a solid,
   liquid, and ionized gas. The density approaches or exceeds that of
   solid matter (10^22-10^26 atoms/cm^3) yet the media behaves as a
   freely-flowing fluid. Due to the proximity of the atoms or to the
   temperature, the system also ionizes, yielding its plasma nature. Dense
   plasmas play a crucial role in such diverse regimes as white dwarf
   stars, planetary interiors, interial confinement fusion, pulse-power
   generators, laser-matter interfaces, sonoluminescence, and certain
   liquid metals. Plasmas are generally considered classical entities.
   However, for this case, the very close packing of the atoms so that
   their electronic wavefunctions strongly overlap forces a quantum
   mechanical treatment. The media resembles a quantal "fluid", where all
   species must be treated democratically.

   To model such a complex media requires very sophisticated techniques so
   that all possible mechanisms such as molecular bonding and
   dissociation, cluster formation, ionization-recombination, and
   attachment-detachment receive treatment on an equal footing. We have
   employed quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) techniques to effect this
   simulation. The electronic component of a composite system of atoms is
   treated within a periodically-replicated reference cell by a
   finite-temperature density functional method in the local density
   approximation, and the nuclear motion by classical mechanics. We have
   also investigated more approximate electronic structure methods such as
   tight-binding and various zero-differential-overlap forms. An example
   of a typical QMD simulation for a system heated above the melting point
   appears in Figure 1. The system begins in a solid state of high
   symmetry (blue), passes through a molecular stage (yellow), and ends in
   a disordered collection of atoms (red).

   We have focused on hydrogen (H) compressed to over ten times its solid
   density at temperatures up to hundreds of thousands of degrees Kelvin.
   At very low temperatures, we find a complex fluid, permeated with long
   chains or filaments of atoms. Increasing the temperature yields an
   insulating diatomic molecular fluid and eventually a purely atomic,
   highly conducting media. Even at the elevated temperatures, transient
   associations of atoms form that profoundly affect both radiative and
   transport properties.

   We also have examined liquid alkali metals, impurities such as argon in
   H plasmas, and the insulator to metal transition in rare gases. The
   former exhibits even more complex behavior than H at low temperatures.
   For example, an expanded sodium (Na) fluid fills with bound clusters of
   between two and eight atoms. Figure 2 illustrates this effect for a
   single snapshot taken during a long trajectory simulation, displaying
   the atoms (red) and their associated bonds (white).

   Quantum molecular dynamics provides a powerful tool for exploring
   intricate properties of matter at conditions of high temperatures or
   pressures.
