                           Astrophysics Data Facility

   The Astrophysics Data Facility (ADF), located at the NASA Goddard Space
   Flight Center (GSFC), is responsible for designing, developing, and
   operating data systems that support the processing, management,
   archiving and distribution of NASA mission data. The ADF serves three
   broadly-defined astrophysics disciplines: high-energy astrophysics,
   UV/optical astrophysics, and infrared/submillimeter/radio astrophysics.
   The ADF, part of the Space Science Data Operations Office (SSDOO),
   collaborates with the GSFC Laboratory for High Energy Astrophysics
   (LHEA) and the Laboratory for Astronomy and Solar Physics (LASP) in
   managing data for specific missions. The ADF staff also support the
   astrophysics community's access to multi-mission and multi-spectral
   data archives in the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC).
