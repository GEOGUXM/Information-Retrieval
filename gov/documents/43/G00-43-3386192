            Employment of Non-Citizens
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Federal Government gives strong priority to hiring United States
       citizens and nationals, but non-citizens may be hired in certain
       circumstances.  Agencies considering non-citizens for Federal
       employment in the competitive service must follow usual selection
       procedures and also meet the requirements of all three of the
       following: immigration law; an appropriations act ban on paying
       certain non-citizens; and an executive order restriction on
       appointing non-citizens in the competitive service.  In addition,
       agencies are responsible for applying any citizenship requirements
       that may appear in their individual agency's authorization and
       appropriation laws.
