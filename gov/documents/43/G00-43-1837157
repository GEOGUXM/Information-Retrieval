                             ENABLING AUTHORITY

   We live in a country of many freedoms - something we generally hold
   more dearly than life itself.  Those freedoms and human rights are what
   makes our country that very special place never before seen on this
   Earth - the envy of almost everyone on the planet.  Those freedoms are
   no accident; they were meticulously planned and fundamentalized by our
   Constitution and their first ten amendments called the Bill of Rights.

   One of the complications of one of those amendments is the principle of
   enabling authority, arising from the Tenth Amendment - and it affects
   our decisions and our abilities and resources on almost a daily basis
   in Civil Air Patrol.  Every time an idea or program or activity is
   considered, the final decision is inherently affected not by the
   question of whether there is any law, regulation, or policy against it
   - but whether there is any law or regulation properly adopted or
   enacted that says we can do it.  This gets even more complicated when
   an attempt is made to require actions of others in the unit or
   discipline someone in some manner for failure to comply with
   unsupported directives.

   What does all this mean, and why is it so?  For a discussion of this
   principle and how it affects Commanders and unit staffs and members at
   every level of Civil Air Patrol, select this link: Enabling authority.

                              CADET PROTECTION

   One of the most important regulations with which we deal is CAPR 52-10:
   CAP Cadet Protection Policy.  New facets of the regulation include a
   definition of hazing and specific prohibitions regarding physical
   training as discipline or punishment, and limited authorization to
   outside instructors.  The new regulation added specific commander
   responsibilities and suggestions for parental involvement.  To download
   CAPR 52-10, use this link: CAP Publications.  For a discussion of
   important sections of this Regulation and to review or download the
   Ohio Wing Supplement, follow this link: Cadet Protection Issues.

                      INDEMNIFICATION AND HOLD HARMLESS

   A developing CAP problem is the use by others of a clause in an
   agreement or other document a unit is often asked to sign when
   requesting use of a facility, whether it is for the unit meeting area,
   a large project or event, or a simple bivouac or visit.  The clause
   uses the words "hold harmless" or "indemnify" or requires the unit to
   pay "attorney fees" in the event of a mishap.  For a discussion of the
   problem and the risks both the CAP and to your own personal assets,
   follow this link: Indemnification and Hold Harmless.

                                 COMPLAINTS

   CAPR 123-2: Complaints has been completely and totally revised.  Even
   if you knew the old regulation well, a quick read still will not do.
   Please review a copy of CAPR 123-2 dated 1 September 1999.  It provides
   specifically for confidentiality, processing a complaint, requirements
   for truthfulness and cooperation, and the format and requirements for
   the investigation report.  It provides that the findings be based upon
   substantial evidence, and it provides that the investigating CAP
   command level shall pay the costs incurred during the investigation.
   All CAP personnel are advised to read and study this new regulation.

   To download a copy, use this link: CAP Publications.  For more
   information on this CAP Regulation, follow this link: Complaints.

   REMEMBER, complaints should always be resolved at the lowest unit
   level, and a problem should be first discussed with your unit
   commander.

   When uncertain about any legal issue, contact your local Legal
   Officer.  If you do not have one, you or your Commander should attempt
   to recruit one for your unit.  A good source of information is the
   Lawyer-Pilots Bar Association.  Another is the Ohio State Bar
   Association.
