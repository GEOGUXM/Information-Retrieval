   Wheelchair Basketball - October 4, 2000

      The kickoff event for this year's celebration is a fast and furious
      game of basketball played by 10 persons in wheelchairs. The NIH police
      are challenging the Maryland Ravens Wheelchair Basketball Team! Tip off
      time is 11:30 a.m. on the Building 1 parking lot. Dr. Ruth Kirschstein,
      The Principal Deputy Director, NIH, will throw the first jump ball.
      Rain date will be the same, except location will be in Building 10,
      14th floor Symnasium.

      For those who can't make the morning game, another match is scheduled
      for 5:30 pm that evening in the Building 10 Gymnasium, on the 14th
      floor. It promises to be a fun day for all.
