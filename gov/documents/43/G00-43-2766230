Other USGS Sites

   The USGS produces, in addition to the topographic maps, aerial
   photography, and cartographic data featured on this site, a wide
   variety of geologic and thematic maps and geospatial data. Links to
   information about these products, or to the products themselves,
   include:

  General Information

   USGS Maps
          Online booklet gives a brief overview of the types of maps sold
          and distributed by the USGS through its Earth Science
          Information Centers (ESIC) and also available from business
          partners located in most States.

   Geologic and Thematic Maps and Map Data
          Describes and links to selected geologic and thematic mapping
          products produced and managed primarily by the Geologic
          Division.

  Online Databases

   National Geologic Map Database (Geologic Division)
          The National Geologic Map Database is managed by the USGS's
          National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program in cooperation
          with the Association of American State Geologists. The database
          consists of four components:

     * Geologic Maps - A catalog of paper and digital maps, and where to
       find them
     * Geologic Names - A catalog of lithologic and geochronologic names
     * Paleontologic Information - A catalog of fossil collections
     * New Mapping - Places where geologic mapping is in progress

Federal Geographic Data Committee

   The Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) coordinates the
   development of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI). The
   NSDI encompasses policies, standards, and procedures for organizations
   to cooperatively produce and share geographic data. The 16 federal
   agencies that make up the FGDC are developing the NSDI in cooperation
   with organizations from state, local and tribal governments, the
   academic community, and the private sector.

   The USGS maintains several Geospatial Data Clearinghouse sites as its
   contribution to the NSDI:
     * Biological Resources Information
     * Geologic Information
     * National Mapping Information
     * Water Resources Information
