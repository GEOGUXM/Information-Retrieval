   Babel Fish AltaVista Translations and FreeTranslations.com
          These are free translation services on the Web that can convert
          English to and from one of French, German, Italian, Portuguese,
          or Spanish. Translation is not perfect, but you can usually make
          sense of those blobs of foreign language you sometimes run
          across. These also work on URLs, to translate Web pages in other
          languages. (Added by Ken Tanaka, 1999 Nov 9)
