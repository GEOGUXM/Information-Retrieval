                   The Sacramento River Riparian Corridor

      When viewed from the surrounding foothills the riparian forests of the
      Sacramento River may appear as a uniform blanket of green growth.  But
      a closer view reveals many distinct types of vegetation and a variety
      of land uses.  Between Red Bluff and Colusa, the mix of native
      vegetation is always changing, because it is adapted to a very dynamic
      system, where flooding, erosion and deposition are a way of life.
      Typical native plant communities along the river include (in order of
      their age, and distance from the river):


   Willow Scrub
   Cottonwood riparian forest
   Mixed riparian forest
   Oak riparian forest
   Valley oak woodland       [native_plant.gif]

      The dynamic river system creates many other important types of habitat
      including:


   Spawning gravels
   Sand and gravel bars
   Shaded Riverine Aquatic Habitat
   Cut banks
   Sloughs, Side Channels and Oxbow Lakes [habitat.gif]

      The fertile floodplain soils also support agricultural crops, such as:


   Walnuts
   Prunes
   Alfalfa [crops.gif]
