     __________________________________________________________________


   This is Labor and Industries' central 'portal' to places on our web
   site where you can actually conduct many types of business with L&I
   over the Internet. The applications listed here take you beyond the
   basic content offered elsewhere on L&I's web site. From here you may
   interact directly with web-enabled databases and even securely access
   some of our systems that will help you accomplish your day-to-day
   business transactions.

   Some of these applications are intended for specific customer groups.
   If so noted, you will need to coordinate with the contact listed for a
   user ID and a password before you can go any further. Other
   applications are intended for widespread use by the public and do not
   require a secure log on process. We expect that this page will grow
   significantly over the months and years ahead so please keep coming
   back! And thank you for stopping by.
