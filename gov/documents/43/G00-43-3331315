The Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer Mission
(1995-present)

   The Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) is a satellite that observes the
   fast-moving, high-energy worlds of black holes, neutron stars, X-ray
   pulsars and bursts of X-rays that light up the sky and then disappear
   forever.

   How fast and how energetic are they? Well, some pulsars spin faster
   than a thousand times a second. And a neutron star produces a
   gravitational pull so powerful that a marshmallow striking the star's
   surface would hit with the force of a thousand hydrogen bombs.
   Astronomers study changes that happen from microseconds to months in
   cosmic objects to learn about how gravity works near black holes, how
   pulsars in binary systems are affected by mass transferring from one
   star to the other, and how the giant engines in distant galaxies are
   powered. RXTE was launched into low-Earth orbit on December 30, 1995,
   and is still going strong, making unique contributions to our
   understanding of these extreme objects.

   For RXTE, the trick to observing these kinds of objects is all in the
   timing -- an ability to observe changes in X-ray brightness that occur
   in a mere thousandths of a second, or over several years. Learn more
   about how this one-of-a-kind satellite has reshaped our understanding
   of what goes on in the most violent and bizarre regions of the
   Universe.
