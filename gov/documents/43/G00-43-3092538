   What's Safekeeping?

   Safekeeping is a benefit offered to active duty military members who
   purchase savings bonds through the payroll savings plan. This benefit
   allows you to have your bonds held by your branch of service instead of
   having the bonds issued and mailed directly to you.

   How Do I Get Information?

   If you have questions about the bonds being held for you or to get your
   bonds out of safekeeping, you need to contact your service's
   safekeeping office.

   Who Do I Contact?
