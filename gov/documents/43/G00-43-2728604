                                                Agenda

   * For 2002, meetings in two months, January and July, are not
   scheduled. This cost saving measure was passed by the Board in support
   of Governor Davis' Executive Order D-49-01 (10/23/01) directing state
   agencies to reduce spending where posssible.

   All meetings are Fridays and Saturdays unless indicated otherwise.

   Consideration for site selection will be priorities for sites in all
   parts of the state and sites that support the requirements for FORMAL
   Appeal Hearings. During the months the Board has a Formal Appeal, that
   site will be arranged to be close to the home of the Appellant.
