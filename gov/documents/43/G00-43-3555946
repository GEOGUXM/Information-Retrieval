                                 REMARKS BY
                    KAREN BROWN, ACTING DIRECTOR OF NIST
                            NIST CENTENNIAL GALA
                                MARCH 6, 2001
                              WASHINGTON, D.C.
   _______________________________________________________________________

    Good evening. Let me add my welcome to this wonderful celebration. My
   role tonight -- aside from enjoying myself -- primarily is to introduce
                   some of our most distinguished guests.

    First, we are honored to have with us a former secretary of commerce:
   Barbara Hackman Franklin, who served as secretary under President Bush
       in 1992-1993. At that time, NIST was building several major new
      programs initiated in the late 1980s to fuel economic growth, and
    participating in a number of presidential initiatives in science and
                                 technology.

      We also are honored to have with us several Members of Congress:
     * Senator Debbie Stabenow from Michigan.  She was formerly in the
       House of Representatives, where she served on the House Committee
       on Science, and specifically, the Subcommittee on Technology, which
       authorizes NIST's budget in the House.
     * Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert of New York, the Chairman of
       the House Committee on Science, who will be speaking in a few
       moments.
     * Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, who serves on the House Science
       Committee and who hails from Texas.
     * Representative Gil Gutnecht of Minnesota, who also serves on the
       House Science Committee.
     * Representative Mark Udall of Colorado, another member of the House
       Committee on Science.  He is from Colorado, representing the
       district that includes NISTs Boulder Laboratories.
     * I also want to acknowledge Rep. Connie Morella. Unfortunately she
       could not be with us tonight, but she was out at NIST -- once again
       -- yesterday to congratulate our employees.

   We are honored to have with us five former NIST directors, representing
                           the past four decades:
     * Lewis Branscomb, who served as director from 1969-1972
     * Ernest Ambler, director from 1975-1989
     * John Lyons, director from 1990-1993
     * Arati Prabhakar, director from 1993-1997
     * Ray Kammer, director from 1997-2000.

   We have a variety of congressional staff and a host of representatives
        of companies and associations that all have a link with NIST.

       I also want to acknowledge the Director of the National Science
    Foundation, Rita Colwell and her Deputy, Joe Bordogna and the Acting
         Administrator of the U.S. Fire Administration, Ken Burris.

   We have many other special guests with us this evening, far too many to
      acknowledge individually now, so I hope you will understand.  But
   theres someone I certainly need to acknowledge -- my boss, Secretary of
      Commerce Don Evans, who will make a few remarks. As Secretary of
     Commerce, Don Evans is in charge of promoting the nations business.

     In his past life, Secretary Evans worked as a roughneck on drilling
   rigs and served as chairman of the board and chief executive officer of
   Tom Brown, Inc. -- a large energy company.  He also chaired the Regents
     of the University of Texas -- a system of nine educational and six
                        health care science centers.

      In a statement before Congress, Secretary Evans has said that his
   objective as Commerce Secretary is to direct the Departments great and
   diverse resources to the common cause of fostering economic strength at
   home and abroad.  Mr. Secretary, I promise you that NIST, with our 100
      years of experience, will be proud to help you attain that goal.

    Now, it is my great pleasure to introduce the Secretary of Commerce,
                              Donald L. Evans.

                        [Remarks by Secretary Evans.]

       It is now my pleasure to introduce a long-time friend of NIST,
   Representative Sherwood Boehlert.  Rep. Boehlert has just been elected
    Chairman of the House Science Committee, which he joined in 1983. He
     was one of the architects in 1988 of the expansion of the National
   Bureau of Standards into NIST, and a creator of the NIST Manufacturing
   Extension Partnership. Chairman Boehlert has been one of our strongest
                         advocates on Capitol Hill.

       We appreciate his support and are so glad he can join us in our
    celebration tonight.  Sherry Boehlert, Chairman of the House Science
                          Committee.  Mr.Chairman!

                    [Remarks by Representative Boehlert]

                           Thank you, Congressman.

       Our next speaker is Thomas A. Manuel.  Tom is chair of the NIST
   Visiting Committee on Advanced Technology. The committee is made up of
    nine prominent leaders of science and technology. It is their job to
   dig into all of NISTs nooks and crannies and tell us what we are doing
     right and where we have opportunities for improvement.  Believe me,
       they love the opportunities for improvement part. Seriously, we
          appreciate their advice and counsel and take it to heart.

    In addition to his role as chair of the visiting committee, Tom is a
     scientist who has worked in the chemical industry for 40 years in a
   number of increasingly responsible positions, including vice president
      at Air Products and Chemicals.  Currently, he is president of the
                       Council for Chemical Research.

                 It is my pleasure to introduce Tom Manuel.

                           [Remarks by Tom Manuel]
