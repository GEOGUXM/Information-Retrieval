   Welcome to the home of the RADIANT team. Our objective is simple: to
   help develop the networking technology of the future.


   Aspects of Networking Addressed

     * Theory, architecture, hardware, and software
     * Modeling, simulation, and implementation
     * Testbeds, the Internet, supercomputing environments, and
       computational grids

   Our networking technology provides middleware and application
   researchers with the necessary communication substrate to address
   complex and diverse research problems such as those presented by the
   Grand Challenge applications, e.g., global climate modeling, quantum
   chromodynamics, and protein folding and sequence analysis.

   Support

   Our research projects and associated collaborations with academia,
   industry, and other national laboratories are supported in part by:
     * DOE Accerlated Strategic Computing Initiative (ASCI)
     * DOE Next-Generation Internet (NGI)
     * DOE Lab-Directed Research and Development (LDRD)
     * Los Alamos Computer Science Institute (LACSI)
     * Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA)


   Research

        * High Performance Networking
        * Monitoring and Measurement
        * Cyber Security
        * Network Architecture
        * Robust Systems and Networks
