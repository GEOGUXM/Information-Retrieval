                      For Immediate Release, 11/2/2001
   Update on Postal Delays Affecting Mail to Vermonts Members of Congress

       Because of lengthy mail delays relating to security precautions
         prompted by the anthrax incidents, the members of Vermonts
    Congressional Delegation Senator Patrick Leahy, Senator Jim Jeffords,
   and Congressman Bernie Sanders today invited constituents to use e-mail
   and phones to expedite messages to their offices in the meantime. They
   said that even when mail service is fully resumed, new procedures will
     change the way congressional mail is handled, possibly creating new
    delays. They said that law enforcement and security authorities have
    also raised the possibility that a portion of the congressional mail
                    already being held may be destroyed.

    They noted that those who do not have personal access to the Internet
   may be able to e-mail from local libraries by using the Internet to go
             to their Web pages and sending messages from there.

       In a joint comment, the Delegation members said: "We regret any
   inconveniences resulting from these delays, and we appreciate the extra
   efforts that Vermonters are making to contact us. We are determined to
    do all we can to keep open the lines of communication that have long
         characterized the relationship between Vermonters and their
                        representatives in Congress."
