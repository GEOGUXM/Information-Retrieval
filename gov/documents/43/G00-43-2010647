   The Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) is the first general purpose
   detector (5000 ton) built to exploit this machine. Event analysis is
   based on charged tracking, magnetic momemtum analysis and fine-grained
   calorimetry. A custom front-end electronics system followed by a large
   Fastbus network provides the readout of the approximately 100,000
   detector channels. The CDF collaboration was a group of 230 physicists
   from 17 institutions in Italy, Japan, and the U.S. in 1988. Since then,
   the collaboration (photo) at the time of the discovery has grown to a
   group of 440 physicists from 35 institutions in Canada Italy, Japan,
   Taiwan, the U.S. at the time of the top quark discovery (March 3,
   1995). The Texas A&M group, led by Prof. R. Webb, built the CDF
   forward/backward hadron calorimeter composed of proportional tube
   chambers and steel plates. The total assembly contains nearly 400 tons
   of steal (213 cm x 213 cm x 5.0 cm) plates and 216 (204 cm x 196 cm x
   2.5 cm) chambers.
