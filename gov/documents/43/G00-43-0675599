   Water Resources of Florida
   Water Use

   The USGS conducts water-use investigations in Florida, and results have
   been published every 5 years since 1965. These published reports
   include assessments of public-supply, domestic self-supplied,
   commercial-industrial self-supplied, agricultural irrigation and
   nonirrigation, and thermoelectric power generation water uses by
   county. Other region-specific water-use reports are also published for
   Florida.

   Nationwide summaries of water-use data have been published by the USGS
   every 5 years since 1950.
