                      Decisions and Orders of the NLRB

   Online NLRB decisions are offered in PDF format. A click on any volume
   link will bring up an index of Decisions and Orders, from which you can
   view or download cases of interest. Slip opinions are subject to
   revision before publication in bound volumes. The search function
   enables you to do "key word" searches of those decisions available
   online--presently back to volume 272. Older decisions are contained in
   bound volumes, which are found in many law libraries. The search engine
   searches a database of these decisions in TEXT and HTML formats.
   Decisions brought up by your search will be in TEXT, HTML and/or PDF
   formats.
