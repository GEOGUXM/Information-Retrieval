   NIH employees make numerous outstanding contributions to the biomedical
   sciences. Contributions such as these are often of such merit that
   these scientists are honored by colleges and universities through the
   awarding of honorary degrees. An employee may receive most honorary
   degrees given for the employees professional contributions and/or
   accomplishments within the employees respective career or occupational
   field. The NIH recommends that awards and honorary degrees be accepted
   on either official duty or on personal time. No outside activity
   request is needed. The following guidelines apply to the acceptance of
   honorary degrees.

   Approval by a Deputy Ethics Counselor:
          An employee may accept an honorary degree from an institution of
          higher education based on a written determination by a Deputy
          Ethics Counselor that the timing of the awarding of the degree
          will not cause a reasonable person to question the employee's
          impartiality in any matter affecting the institution. For
          example, the Deputy Ethics Counselor should verify whether there
          are any pending lawsuits, investigations, grant or contract
          applications or disputes, or other similar matters, involving
          the institution conferring the degree or the employee to whom
          the degree is offered. If such pending matters exist, a
          determination will have to be made, based upon the
          circumstances, as to whether the pending matter is such that the
          employee can accept the honorary degree.


   Disqualification:
          To avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest, an employee
          must be disqualified from all matters involving the institution
          awarding the degree from the date that the employee decided to
          accept the degree to the date the degree is conferred, or the
          date that all monetary matters associated with the degree are
          received (e.g., travel reimbursement).


   Official Duty Activity :
          It is recommended that the employee accept an honorary degree as
          an official duty activity.


   Honorary Degrees from Foreign Governments:
          The Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act  (FGDA) (5 USC 7342(d)),
          provides congressional consent to the receipt of decorations
          from public universities operated by a foreign government.  The
          Department of Justice has interpreted decorations to include
          honorary degrees.  [Federal employees are prohibited from having
          an outside activity with a foreign public university by the
          emoluments clause in the US Constitution.   But receipt of an
          honorary degree is not an outside activity and there is no
          receipt of a "present, Emolument, Office, or Title from" the
          foreign government.]
