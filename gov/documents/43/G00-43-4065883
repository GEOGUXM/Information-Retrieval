NIS-7 Nuclear Safeguards

   The nuclear safeguards program at Los Alamos began in December, 1966
   under the leadership of Robert Keepin. Six months later the Atomic
   Energy Commission (AEC) established the Office of Safeguards and
   Materials Management at its Washington Headquarters, as well as a new
   Division of Safeguards in the AEC Regulatory Branch (now the Nuclear
   Regulatory commission).

   The new Los Alamos R&D program began a long and successful program in
   nondestructive assay (NDA) instrumentation. Close liaison between
   safeguards researchers and the Laboratory's materials processing
   experts contributed significantly to Los Alamos' leadership in
   safeguards research and development on both the domestic and the
   internationsl level.

   In 1974, an early forerunner of the now-familiar concept of
   near-real-time accounting systems was developed. This was the Dynamic
   Materials Accounting and Control (DYMAC) concept. It combined

   [bluedot.gif] Los Alamos' proven unit-process-based system of
   accounting,

   [bluedot.gif] the "in-line" rapid measurement capability of newly
   developed NDA instruments and techniques,

   [bluedot.gif] and the many advantages of computerized data entry,
   storage, analysis and retrieval.

   In recent years, the Los Alamos safeguards program has included a
   number of training courses taught by Laboratory personnel for the
   domestic and international safeguards community, including inspectors
   for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). IAEA inspectors come
   from countries as diverse as Japan, Korea, Sweden, and Russia. Other
   courses are taught in Materials Control and Accounting and State
   Systems of Accounting. Additionally, there is recent focus on smart
   instrumentation, software systems, advanced materials control and
   accounting systems, systems studies, treaty verification, and facility
   monitoring.

   Work in this area is conducted by the 3 LANL Nuclear Safeguards groups:

   [bluedot.gif] Safeguards Science and Technology (NIS-5)
   [bluedot.gif] Advanced Nuclear Technology (NIS-6) and
   [bluedot.gif] Safeguards Systems (NIS-7) .
