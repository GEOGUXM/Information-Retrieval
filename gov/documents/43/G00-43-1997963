   The Worksite Health Promotion Program was created to expand
   opportunities for employees to learn and practice healthful behaviors
   and to integrate health and wellness into all aspects of work life.

   The NIH Worksite Health Promotion Action Committee (WHPAC) was formed
   in 1992 to identify areas where healthful changes could be made to the
   NIH work environment and to develop strategies to make the changes
   occur. The WHPAC is comprised of volunteers from key functional areas
   and other interested employees who want to make NIH a healthier place
   to work.

   The mission of the WHPAC is to create and implement a program to
   enhance the physical, emotional, social, and mental health of all NIH
   employees, and establish NIH as the national leader of worksite health
   promotion and disease prevention.

   Specifically, the committee has been responsible for ensuring that NIH:
     * addresses and meets worksite objectives of Healthy People 2000 (the
       DHHS/PHS National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention
       Objectives for the Nation),
     * offers NIH employees a safe and healthful work environment,
     * provides appropriate health promotion activities, including
       programs targeted to high risk populations, and
     * fosters a corporate culture that values and encourages health.

   This includes working on quality of life issues related to nutrition,
   exercise, blood pressure and cholesterol control, work and family
   issues, injury prevention and stress management, as well as analyzing
   and possibly recommending changes of policies to improve the work
   environment.

   The WHPAC Safety Subcommittee works to identify safety issues affecting
   employees in the work place, and on ways to alleviate these problems.
   Recently, this subcommittee, working with the Design, Construction and
   Alterations Branch and the Maintenance Engineering Section, Division of
   Engineering Services, studied ways to reduce the adverse effects
   (noise, odors, and dust) renovation projects cause on work areas
   adjacent to construction sites. They then devised a more coordinated
   system for notifying building occupants of the nature of impending
   renovation projects, educating employees about how to handle a
   situation where the work environment is affected, and developing a
   feedback mechanism to keep employees informed when an incident occurs.
   Currently, the subcommittee is looking at problems involving corridor
   utilization, and will be developing guidelines and procedures that can
   be adopted NIH-wide to create a safer environment.

   The WHPAC commissioned an ergonomics study of several NIH laboratories
   in which laboratory personnel were evaluated for potential repetitive
   strain injuries caused by poor ergonomics.

   A videotape has been prepared and will be distributed through the
   intramural program to allow all laboratory employees access to this
   information. The tape demonstrates how injuries can occur as a result
   of poor ergonomics and suggests steps to take to reduce the risk of
   repetitive strain injuries in the laboratory. The tape is also
   available through the WHPP Health Information Library.

   Working with the Office of Research on Women's Health and the National
   Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the WHPAC implemented
   a worksite lactation program. Clean, secure, and private rooms,
   equipped with electronic breast pumps are located in Buildings 31, 10,
   and 45 on the NIH campus. In addition, NIH will provide the services of
   a lactation consultant to assist new mothers with the transition from
   hospital to home and home to work; and an educational program to
   encourage the prospective mothers to consider breast feeding as the
   primary source of nutrition for their infants in accordance with the
   American Academy of Pediatrics' guidelines.
