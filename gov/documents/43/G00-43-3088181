   Amy works on Unix and VMS machines. She programs in Perl for web-cgi
   stuff, IDL to maintain BATSE software, and sometimes in C for porting
   software. She works in the SOHO Experiment Analysis Facility (EAF). In
   addition, Amy sometimes helps out at the SOHO EOF.

   Amy is NOT a solar physicist or astronomer. If you have a question
   about sunspots, eclipses, solar flares, or related topics, please ask a
   scientist. Amy will be happy to answer questions about data access and
   software use, among other things.

   There are several local resources for science related questions,
   including
     * the Public Affairs Office at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
     * Ask Dr. SOHO, - Dr. SOHO is a group of scientists from the SOHO
       project who can answer questions about the sun, especially about
       current research. And most especially concerning results from their
       instruments aboard the SOHO satellite.
     * The Solar Flare Theory webpage - a very good webpage about solar
       flares. Dr. Gordon Holman answers questions about the sun.
