                             Regional Geochemistry

   Team research on regional geochemistry involves the development of a
   coherent nationwide geochemical database through the integration of
   existing databases and new data. Other projects utilize and develop
   multi-element, multi-media geochemical databases to determine
   geochemical baselines for assessing the natural abundance and
   distribution of chemical elements and any changes caused by human
   activities.
