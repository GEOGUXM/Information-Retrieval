   Walden Encourages 2^nd District Residents to Use Email in Correspondence to
                              Washington, D.C.

     Regular mail delivery to Capitol Hill offices continues to be slow,
                                 unreliable

   WASHINGTON, D.C. U.S. Congressman Greg Walden (R-OR) today encouraged
   residents of Oregons 2^nd District to use email and fax as alternative
   methods of communicating with his Washington, D.C. office due to the
   slowness and uncertainty of U.S. mail reaching Congressional offices.
   The delivery of regular mail to Congressional office buildings in
   Washington, D.C. was expected to resume in recent weeks following
   months of delays as a result of the bioterror attacks last year.
   Nevertheless, despite assurances that mail delivery would return to
   normal, regular mail remains an extremely slow and unreliable mode of
   communicating with lawmakers in Washington, D.C.  This slowdown in mail
   delivery has hindered Congressman Waldens ability to respond to 2^nd
   District residents who contact him via regular U.S. mail.

   Regular U.S. mail is still not reaching my Washington, D.C. office as
   quickly or as reliably as I would like, said Walden.  As a result, Ive
   been unable to respond to a number of Oregonians who have contacted me
   via regular mail with their concerns.  Keeping in regular contact with
   the people I represent in Oregon is extremely important to me, so I
   encourage the use of other means of communication to get in touch with
   me.  I want to make sure people know they have a reliable way to reach
   me, and email is probably the most convenient and efficient means of
   communication.

   Congressman Walden can be reached via email at
   greg.walden@mail.house.gov.  Walden also maintains a web site
   (www.walden.house.gov) where Oregonians can sign up for his weekly
   email newsletter, the Oregon Congressional Connection, as well as fill
   out an online survey to register their opinions on local and national
   issues.

   Understanding the concerns of 2^nd District residents is critical to my
   being able to represent them effectively in Congress, said Walden.  I
   encourage people to take a moment to fill out the survey on my web site
   and let me know their positions on the issues that matter most to
   them.

   Congressman Walden represents the Second Congressional District of
   Oregon, which includes the 20 counties of southern, central and eastern
   Oregon. Rep. Walden is a member of the House Energy and Commerce
   Committee and The House Committee on Resources
