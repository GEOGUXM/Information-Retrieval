   Subject: Interim Procedures for Manual Observations with the
   Implementation of Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS)

   Purpose. The National Weather Service (NWS) Policy on Manual
   Observations with the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS)
   (referred to as "the policy" in this letter) is given in Attachment 1.
   This policy supports NWS mission requirements and addresses
   requirements of the climate community. It recognizes the complementary
   nature of remote sensing systems, manually observed weather elements,
   and automated surface observations. This OML defines interim procedures
   for manual observations with ASOS based on this policy and on
   requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

   Augmentation and Backup. While the policy identifies requirements for
   NWS-staffed sites to report certain manually observed weather elements
   separate from (supplementary to) the ASOS report, it does not identify
   any requirements to append (augment) manually observed weather elements
   to the ASOS report. Nor does it identify any requirements for manual
   backup to ASOS in the event of a system failure. In development of this
   policy, it was recognized that user communities, and in particular the
   aviation community, could identify further requirements for manual
   observations or backup that the NWS would need to address.

   We have been actively supporting the FAA in its formulation of the
   aviation community's requirements for manual observations, as well as
   for backup. The FAA has provided a statement of its requirements for
   augmentation and backup for initial operations with ASOS. To support
   these requirements, NWS ASOS sites at airports are directed to:

     Augment ASOS for thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, virga, and volcanic
     ash as long as staff are available and trained in surface observing,
     and

     Back up ASOS as long as staff are available and trained in surface
     observing.

   In the near term, I expect that we should be able to provide this level
   of augmentation and backup for all of our early ASOS sites for their
   current observing times (i.e., part-time at current part-time offices)
   under this policy. We will continue to support the FAA as it refines
   its requirements based on early experiences with ASOS, introduction of
   new ASOS capabilities, and the availability of other complementary data
   sources. Also, we are advising the FAA of our site-specific
   modernization and associated restructuring schedule that impacts the
   availability of our staff to meet FAA's requirements. Transfer of these
   augmentation and backup responsibilities to the FAA will occur as the
   availability of our resources dictate.

   One other area of augmentation needs to be addressed on an interim
   basis because of the delayed availability of the ASOS freezing rain
   sensor. NWS ASOS sites at airports are directed to:

     Augment ASOS for freezing rain.

   The Systems Program Office has advised us that this sensor will be
   available late this calendar year.

   Specific procedures for augmentation and backup are described in the
   NWS Observing Handbook No. 7, Surface Observations.

   Supplementary Data. Supplementary data reports that address
   requirements of the climate community are identified in Sections 2.5
   and 2.8 of the policy. National standards for reporting these elements
   are under development and will be implemented later this year. In the
   interim, upon ASOS commissioning, regional and local procedures are
   encouraged to continue to maintain a record of these elements at future
   Weather Forecast Office locations that have a surface observing
   program.

   Section 2.7 of the policy identifies weather elements to be reported at
   selected sites to support aviation forecast services. Attachment 2
   identifies the sites from ASOS lots 1 through 2b that have requirements
   for reporting these weather elements. National standards for reporting
   these elements are under development and will be available prior to a
   commissioning of ASOS at these sites.

                      NWS POLICY ON MANUAL OBSERVATIONS
                       WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AS0S
                                 May 3, 1991
                           (Updated July 2, 1992)

   1. PURPOSE

   The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance for the standardized
   implementation and operation of ASOS in support of NWS modernization
   and associated restructuring.

   2. POLICY

   2.1    Following ASOS commissioning, the ASOS observation will be the
   official observation from that site.

   2.2    NWS forecast and warning services can be provided without ASOS
   augmentation. However, the NWS will work to support the augmentation
   requirements of other agencies.

   2.3    The specified system availability meets NWS requirements.
   However, the NWS will work to support backup requirements of other
   agencies.

   2.4    All NWS staffed field offices will report to cognizant NWS
   offices--for inclusion in weather warnings and statements--the
   existence of volcanic eruptions and volcanic ash when first noted and
   severe weather1 when first observed from the field offices.

   2.5    At offices scheduled to be Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs),
   while the information remains climatologically important, operationally
   useful, or until it can be provided by complementary technologies,
   supplemental networks, or other means, the following will be reported:

   ^1Severe weather in the context of this policy encompasses tornadic
   activity (tornados, funnel clouds, and waterspouts) and severe
   thunderstorms (thunderstorms accompanied by wind gusts > 50 knots
   and/or hail > 3/4 inch diameter). The availability of official wind
   measuring equipment or a wind recorder is not a prerequisite for
   reporting severe thunderstorms at NWS staffed sites. At such sites
   without official wind equipment, the primary low-level wind shear alert
   sensor, other on-site wind equipment, other available observing systems
   information, or visual estimates (e.g., observations of damage
   compatible with winds of 50 kts or greater) will suffice for resolving
   thunderstorm severity.

     * Water equivalent of snow on the ground - once daily.
     * Calendar day maximum and minimum temperatures (once daily at WFOs
       without collocated ASOS
     * Calendar day total precipitation (liquid equivalent once daily at
       WFOs without collocated ASOS)
     * 6-hourly reports at main synoptic reporting times. The following
       elements will be reported with content similar to that contained in
       synoptic messages.

     . Total cloud cover
     . Low cloud base height (at WFOs without collocated ASOS)
     . Low cloud amount (at WFOs without collocated ASOS)
     . Low, middle, and high cloud types|
     . Precipitation type and intensity2 (at WFOs without collocated
     ASOS)
     . Snowfall amount and snow depth.
     . Volcanic ash when observed.

   - SNOINCR remarks - hourly when snowfall rate equals or exceeds
   0.5"/hr.

   - Hail of any size - when first observed.
   - Ice pellets - when first observed and when the event ends.

   These data will be communicated as messages separate from the ASOS
   report and will not be appended to the ASOS observation.

   2.6    Supplementary networks (comprised of utilities, air quality
   agencies, transportation departments, cooperative observers, etc.) will
   continue to supplement the surface observation database with
   operationally useful information. NWS staffed sites which are not
   destined to become WFO's may function as members of these supplementary
   data networks while staff are available at the sites. The observational
   information provided by supplementary networks will not be appended to
   ASOS observations.

   The role of Data Collection Offices (DCO's) as providers of
   supplementary data will be examined.

   ^2It is recognized that the intensity reported for snow and drizzle are
   related to visibility and that visibility will be particularly
   difficult to assess at some WFOs. Lacking suitable visibility reference
   points, the best available means will be used to estimate the
   visibility restriction.

   2.7    At specific, currently staffed NWS observing sites which are
   determined to be especially problematic with respect to terrain, one or
   more of the following will be reported as needed to support aviation
   forecast services:

       - Virga and distant precipitation, on occurrence, in mountainous
   areas lacking radar coverage.

       - Operationally significant clouds above 12,000 ft in mountainous
   areas.

       - Distant clouds obscuring mountains.

       - Operationally significant local variations in visibility (e.g.,
   fog banks), where multiple visibility sensors are not available or do
   not suffice.

   These data will be manually reported while they are needed or until
   they can be provided by complementary technologies or other means. They
   will be communicated as messages separate from the ASOS report and will
   not be appended to the ASOS observation.

   2.8    At existing official NWS sunshine duration reporting sites until
   an ASOS sunshine sensor is fielded, the following will be reported:

   - Daily total sunshine duration.

   These data will be communicated as messages separate from the ASOS
   report and will not be appended to the ASOS observation.

   2.9    At selected NWS staffed ASOS sites, for a period of at least one
   year, the following will be reported:

     - Comparative observations (ASOS vs manual):
     . Calendar day liquid precipitation accumulation.
     . Calendar day max/min temperatures.
     - 6-hourly supplemental observations:
     .Temperature and dew point.
     .Total cloud cover and cloud types.
     .Visibility and obstructions to vision.
     .Present weather.
     . Snowfall amount and snow depth.

   These data will be made available for comparative analysis to support a
   climate data continuity study sponsored by the NWS. They will not be
   appended to the ASOS observation.
