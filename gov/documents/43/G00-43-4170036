                    INFORMATION ON CONVERSION TO THE EURO


   On January 1, 2002, the Euro will begin to replace the local currencies
   of twelve European Union (EU) member nations. The countries adopting
   the Euro are Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
   Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain.
   Denmark, Sweden, and the United Kingdom will not be changing from their
   local currencies to the Euro at this time.

   Each EU member nation making the change to the Euro will phase in the
   new Euro currency separately. The EU Central Bank's Internet web site
   has complete information in several languages, including English, about
   each country's conversion schedule (http://www.euro.ecb.int).

   The Euro will become legal tender in all twelve countries. Local
   currencies will still be accepted as legal tender for most financial
   transactions for a period of time. However, in the twelve listed
   countries, automatic teller machines (ATM's) will begin to issue Euros,
   banks will provide Euros for foreign currency exchange and vendors have
   been encouraged to provide change in Euros as of January 1. Delays in
   financial transactions may result during the initial stages of the
   transition.

   Effective January 1, U.S. Embassies and Consulates located in the
   twelve "Euro" countries will accept only dollars and the new currency,
   Euros, for fee-based services.
