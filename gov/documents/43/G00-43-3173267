     Chandra finds ghosts of eruption in galaxy cluster

     "Ghostly" relics of an ancient eruption that tore through a cluster
     of galaxies were recently uncovered by NASA's Chandra X-ray
     Observatory. The discovery implies that galaxy clusters are the
     sites of enormously energetic and recurring explosions, and may
     provide an explanation why galaxy clusters behave like giant cosmic
     magnets.

     "Chandra's image revealed vast regions in the galaxy cluster Abell
     2597 that contain almost no X-ray or radio emission. We call them
     ghost cavities," said Brian McNamara of Ohio University in Athens
     today during a press conference at the American Astronomical Society
     meeting in Washington. "They appear to be remnants of an old
     explosion where the radio emission has faded away over millions of
     years."

     The ghost cavities were likely created by extremely powerful
     explosions, due to material falling toward a black hole millions of
     times more massive than the Sun. As the matter swirled around the
     black hole, located in a galaxy near the center of the cluster, it
     generated enormous electromagnetic fields that expelled material
     from the vicinity of the black hole at high speeds.

     This explosive activity in Abell 2597 created jets of highly
     energetic particles that cleared out voids in the hot gas. Because
     they are lighter than the surrounding material, the cavities will
     eventually push their way to the edge of the cluster, just as air
     bubbles in water make their way to the surface.

     Researchers also found evidence that this explosion was not a
     one-time event. "We detected a small, bright radio source near the
     center of the cluster that indicates a new explosion has occurred
     recently," said team member Michael Wise of the Massachusetts
     Institute of Technology in Cambridge, "so the cycle of eruption is
     apparently continuing."

     Though dim, the ghost cavities are not completely empty. They
     contain a mixture of very hot gas, high-energy particles and
     magnetic fields -- otherwise the cavities would have collapsed under
     the pressure of the surrounding hot gas.

     "Ghost cavities may be the vessels that transport magnetic fields
     generated in a disk surrounding a giant black hole to the cluster
     gas that is spread over a region a billion times larger," said
     McNamara. If dozens of these cavities were created over the life of
     the cluster, they could explain the surprisingly strong magnetic
     field of the multimillion-degree gas that pervades the cluster.

     Galaxy clusters are the largest known gravitationally bound
     structures in the universe. Hundreds of galaxies swarm in giant
     reservoirs of multimillion-degree gas that radiates most of its
     energy in X-rays. Over the course of billions of years some of the
     gas should cool and sink toward a galaxy in the center of the
     cluster where it could trigger an outburst in the vicinity of the
     central massive black hole.

     Chandra observed Abell 2597 on July 28, 2000,for 40,000 seconds with
     the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) instrument.
     Pennsylvania State University, University Park, and MIT developed
     the instrument for NASA. In addition to a group of astronomers from
     the Space Telescope Science Institute, Baltimore, and the University
     of Virginia, Charlottesville, the team included: Paul Nulsen,
     University of Wollagong, Australia; Larry David, Harvard-Smithsonian
     Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Mass.; Chris Carilli, National
     Radio Astronomy Observatory, Socorro, N.M.; and Craig Sarazin,
     University of Virginia.

     NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., manages the
     Chandra program, and TRW, Inc., Redondo Beach, Calif., is the prime
     contractor for the spacecraft.

     The Smithsonian's Chandra X-ray Center controls science and flight
     operations from Cambridge, Mass.
