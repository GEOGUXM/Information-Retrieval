Metrics/Measurement Subgroup

   The goal of the Metrics/Measurement Subgroup is to support the
   development of safe, reliable, and cost effective software systems for
   NASA's Strategic Enterprises by continually improving NASA's software
   engineering processes to produce measured improvements in the cost and
   quality of software developed for and by NASA.

   The primary objectives of the Metrics/Measurement Subgroup are as
   follows:
    1. Increase awareness of existing measurement/metrics programs,
       training opportunities, and support services.
          + Promote and directly support the establishment of measurement
            collection and usage within NASA projects and programs.
          + Identify Center contacts that are using metrics/measurement.
          + Publicize Metrics/Measurement lessons learned.
          + Publicize availability of measurement support products and
            related information.
    2. Assure that the process and program measures being collected
       support the needs of software engineering researchers and
       improvement analysts.
          + Ensure that software-related RTOPs/Center Initiatives are
            collecting appropriate measures.
          + Ensure that these measures are available for subsequent
            research.
    3. Define domain-based approaches for evaluating, adopting, and
       tailoring processes and technologies based on experimentation and
       measurement.
    4. Define a framework to support NASA's software insight needs in the
       era of performance-based contracts and other acquisition vehicles.
          + Provide metrics to support the insight functional role to
            which assurance efforts are transitioning.

   These objectives support Goal 3 of the NASA Software Strategic Plan.
