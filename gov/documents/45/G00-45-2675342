                               Privacy Policy

   Our privacy policy is simple: We will not collect personal information
   about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that
                             information to us.

               Information Collected and Stored Automatically

     If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website,
   read pages, or download information, our webserver will only gather and
      store certain computer related information about your visit. This
                information does NOT identify you personally.

   Below is an sample line from our daily server log. Such a line is made
             for each file a computer retrieves from our server:

      00:34:56 127.0.0.1 GET /index.asp 200 Mozilla/4.7+[en]+(Win98;+I)
      * The first number is the time that a computer accessed our site on
                              that particular day;
     * The second number is the computer's IP address (an IP address is a
         number that is automatically assigned to a computer whenever it
          surfs the Web) from which the computer accesses our website;
      * The next three items are technical data which identifies how the
          computer tried to access our site (GET or PUT), what page was
       accessed (in this case /index.asp) and finally whether the page was
        loaded sucessfully or not (200 means that it was, 404 means that
                            the page was not found).
      * Finally, the last item records the type of browser and operating
                         system used to access our site;

       These are general statistics to help us determine the number of
    visitors to our site, what pages and links are the most popular, and
       whether or not there were any errors in accessing the website.

   We do not track what you, as an individual, look at. We have no way of
   obtaining your name or e-mail address unless you give it to us. If you
    do provide such information to us it is not kept in the same place as
     the computer logs, so there is no way such a name or address can be
                   attached to the pages that were viewed.

                     If You Send Us Personal Information

      If you choose to provide us with personal information -- as in an
        e-mail to Bernie, or by filling out a form with your personal
   information and submitting it to us through our website -- we use that
       information to respond to your message and to help get you the
   information or action you have requested. We treat emails the same way
              we treat letters sent to Bernie via regular mail.

    We do not collect personal information for any purpose other than to
    respond to you. We do not share your information with anyone, unless
     you have specifically requested we intervene (ie. with a government
          agency) on your behalf, or as otherwise required by law.

     If at anytime you would like to change or update your information,
       please contact us at (802) 862-0697 or toll-free 1-800-339-9834
                               (Vermont only).

                               E-mail updates

     If you sign up for Bernie's e-mail list, your email address will be
   used by the Office of Congressman Bernie Sanders only. It will never be
   shared with any other entity. You can unsubscribe from the e-mail list
         or change your personal information by sending an email to
                         bernielist@mail.house.gov.

                            Links to Other Sites

     Our Website has links to many agencies, organizations and entities.
   Before leaving Bernie's site, a page will appear informing you that you
   are leaving our server. Once you link to another site, you are subject
                   to the privacy policy of the new site.

                                  "Cookies"

      Cookies, if properly used, pose no privacy threat to a user. This
    website uses "cookies" only if the user chooses to participate in the
         VermontInteractive program, which is designed to allow the
   personalization of a webpage on Bernie's site. In this case, the cookie
      records the only the settings that the user submits to the site.

     Our server software, Microsoft IIS 4.0, often tries to use "session
    cookies" to help a computer retrieve information from the server, but
        which contains no personal information. In order to avoid any
    misunderstandings, we have removed the use of these cookies from our
       website. If for some reason you encounter any of these "session
    cookies" in use on our website, or if you have any other questions or
                   concerns, please contact the webmaster.
