   ECT Success Stories

   Microsoft Campus Site Licenses
   Controls for ANL Boiler

   Microsoft Campus Agreement

   ECT Client Computing Services working together with Argonne Procurement
   negotiated a Microsoft Campus subscription program through the
   University of Chicago that licenses software by user rather than by
   computer. Software licensed in this way may be used on any
   Argonne-owned computer system that have a Microsoft operating system
   license.

   This MS campus agreement has saved Argonne thousands of dollars in
   software purchase costs.

     ECT Electronics Engineering
   Designs Controls for ANL Boiler

   ANL/PFS Boiler number 5 has undergone an extensive controls upgrade.
   During this upgrade, ECT provided the contractor, ABB, with Allen
   Bradley PLC programming support for burner management and combustion
   control. Another project, titled stoker motor upgrade included
   replacement of the stoker feeder motors (one motor per three stokers)
   with an individual AC variable speed drive per stoker (six total). A
   stoker feeds coal into the combustion chamber.

   Stoker feeder features included :
     * Manual and automatic speed control of individual stoker
     * An automatic operating sequence that would dislodge obstructions
     * Automatic, startup features
     * Local and remote control
     * Drive fault readout display
     * Operator safety enhancements

   Together these projects have saved Argonne National Laboratory
   thousands of dollars in fuel cost and most importantly operator safety.
