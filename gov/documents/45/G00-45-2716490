   LDAD graphical user interface download website and installation
   instructions.

   Step 1) ReadMe contains the installation instructions in text format.

     HTTP: Download ReadMe

   Step 2) Determine your operating system and download the appropriate
   setup.

     HTTP: Windows NT/95/98 setup.exe

     or

     HTTP: UNIX setup.sh

   Step 3) Execute "setup" on your computer. Setup will create
   installation directories at "C:\Program Files\webDissem". It will also
   create a desktop icon and a Start menuitem named "sync". It will also
   create a desktop icon and a Start menuitem named webDissem. The
   download must be synchronized before it is possible to run webDissem
   since the "sync" downloads the webDissem application along with
   localization information. Synchronizing in the future will allow the
   application, menus, and static datasets such as maps to be updated on
   your hard drive with the version on the website. If setup cannot find
   Java version 1.1.7B or newer on your system, it will be necessary to
   download the Java Runtime Environment, JRE, version 1.1.7B and expand
   it.

     HTTP: Download jre.exe 1.1.7B

   Step 4) Log off the internet and connect your computer to the website
   via dial-in terminal server or via your internet service provider. In
   general, a dial-in connection is more reliable due to the dedicated
   line which is not impacted by internet traffic and bandwidth loading.

     Connect via DIAL-IN TERMINAL SERVER from Windows NT using Java JRE
     application.
