   NWISweb is the online system for retrieving USGS water-resources data.
   Data are available for the following categories:
   Real-Time
   Data typically are recorded at 15-60 minute intervals, stored onsite,
   and then transmitted to USGS offices every 1 to 4 hours.
   Site Information
   Information about sites at stream reaches, wells, test holes, springs,
   tunnels, drains, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, excavations, and water-use
   facilities.
   Ground-Water
   More than 850,000 records of wells, springs, test holes,
   tunnels,drains, and excavations in the United States.
   Surface-Water
   More than 850,000 station years of time-series data that describe
   stream levels, streamflow (discharge), reservoir and lake levels,
   surface-water quality, and rainfall.

   Water Quality
   Over 3.5 million historical water quality analyses in the USGS district
   data bases through September 1999.
