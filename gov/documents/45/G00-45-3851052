   The Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act of 1999 (NRDAA) allows
   qualifying hospitals to employ temporary foreign workers
   (nonimmigrants) as Registered Nurses (RNs) for up to three years under
   H-1C visas. Only 500 H-1C visas can be issued each year during the four
   year period of the H-1C program (2000-2004). The sponsoring employer
   must pay a filing fee of $250 for each application filed with the DOL.
   H-1C nurses may be admitted for a period of three years; thus far, the
   law does not provide for an extension of that time frame.
   Qualifying Criteria
   The sponsoring employer must meet strict criteria to employ foreign RNs
   under the H-1C program. Broadly, these include:
     * be a "subpart D" hospital under the Social Security Act;
     * be located in a Health Professional Shortage Area as of March 31,
       1997;
     * have at least 190 acute care beds according to the 1994 cost
       report;
     * have a Medicare population of 35% according to the 1994 cost
       report; and
     * have a Medicaid population of 28% according to the 1994 cost
       report.

   The qualifying RN must:
     * have obtained a full and unrestricted license to practice in the
       country where the nursing education was obtained, or have received
       a nursing education in the U.S.;
     * (a) have passed the examination given by the Commission on
       Graduates for Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS); or (b) have a full
       and unrestricted license to practice as a RN in the state where the
       RN will work; or (c) have a full and unrestricted RN's license in
       any state and have received temporary authorization to practice as
       a RN in the state where you will work; and
     * be fully qualified and eligible under the laws governing the place
       where the RN will work to practice as a RN immediately upon
       admission to the U.S., and be authorized under such laws to be
       employed by the hospital.

   Process for Filing
   To file an attestation for a H-1C visa, the sponsoring hospital must:
    1. Complete a Form ETA 9081 , Attestation for H-1C Nonimmigrant Nurses
       with the DOL Employment and Training Administration (address
       provided in the next paragraph) containing the required attestation
       elements. If it is the first attestation by the hospital under
       H-1C, copies of the hospital's Form HCFA 2552 from the 1994 cost
       reporting period filed with HHS, which provides information on
       acute care beds, and percentage of Medicare/Medicaid patients, must
       accompany Form ETA 9081. The form also requires an attestation by
       the hospital that it has taken timely and significant steps to
       retain sufficient registered nurses who are U.S. citizens or
       immigrants who are authorized to perform nursing services.
    2. The Form ETA 9081, signed by the chief executive officer of the
       facility, must be submitted to:
       Chief, Division of Foreign Labor Certifications
       Employment Training Administration
       U.S. Department of Labor, Room C-4318
       200 Constitution Avenue, NW
       Washington, DC 20210
    3. A filing fee of $250 per attestation must be included.
    4. After the DOL accepts the application, the hospital will be
       notified and must file a Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (INS Form
       I-129) with the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
