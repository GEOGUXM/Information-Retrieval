   WISE USE OR ABUSE
   The word conservation means to carefully preserve and protect
   something. Conservation is planned management of a natural resource to
   prevent exploitation, destruction or neglect.

   Our Western culture has historically exploited natural resources for
   its own benefit. Fortunately, it has boosted human responsibility to
   protect all living things, the land, air and water. Never in our
   history has resource management been more important than now.

   Our ecosphere, a relatively thin belt of water, land and atmosphere, is
   comprised of separate, yet interrelated communities of living things
   called ecosystems. Each ecosystem is unique in it population of plants,
   animals, bacteria and viruses. Each community demands a specific
   physical and chemical environment to survive. The fragile relationship
   between the biological and physical world is continually changing.

   When the physical or chemical composition of a natural community
   changes, the biological composition also changes. We take little notice
   of gradual changes, a lake filling in to become a marshland, then a
   bog, and finally a meadow. But sudden changes, such as volcanic
   eruptions or those caused by human action, can be a shocking reminder
   of how fragile our ecosphere is.

   Our rapid population growth and intensive use of land have had profound
   effects, accelerating the natural geological processes of soil erosion
   in many places. Soils, which require many centuries to form, may be
   eroded away in a single rainstorm because of improper land use.

   We don't always practice good forest management either, because of the
   great demand of wood products. When too many trees are taken from an
   area, wildlife habitat is destroyed and soil is left bare and
   unprotected. Soil is washed into streams and rivers, causing them to
   fill with sediment. This causes flooding, which destroys even more land
   and property.

   Poor practices cause us to lose wildlife, destroy natural areas, thin
   surface soil, cause food production costs to soar, and cause the
   national economy to suffer severe losses. Nature consents to being used
   but not abused. It is our responsibility to learn where the limits are.

   AGENTS OF EROSION
   Of the four agents of erosion--water, wind, ice and gravity, running
   water changes the Earth's landscapes the most.

   Water Erosion usually follows three steps: (1) loosening soil particles
   by the impact of the raindrops or by the scouring action of runoff; (2)
   moving the detached particles by flowing water; and (3) depositing the
   particles at new locations.

   Wind Erosion is primarily in dry areas. It occurs by two
   processes--deflation and sandblasting. Deflation is simply the lifting
   up of sand and dust-sized particles by wind. Deflation removes the fine
   soil material, leaving behind larger particles to produce a surface,
   armored by a pebble layer, against further deflation. Sandblasting by
   wind-driven sand grains can produce some artfully shaped pebbles called
   ventifacts or dreikenter (German for "three edges").

   REMEMBER--WISE USE PREVENTS ABUSE
   Soil and water conservation practices that inhibit erosion of our
   topsoil and keep our water clean help us conserve our limited
   resources. Remember -- wise use prevents abuse!
