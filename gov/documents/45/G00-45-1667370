   VEHICLE BUYBACK PROGRAM

          Sponsored by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District
     __________________________________________________________________

   To reduce air pollution, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District
   (Air District) will pay $500 for an operating and registered 1981 and
   earlier model year vehicle. These vehicles will be scrapped by Pick
   Your Part, Pick-N-Pull, or Environmental Engineering Studies, the Air
   District's contractors. This voluntary program takes older vehicles off
   the road that would otherwise likely remain on the roads.  The Vehicle
   Buy Back program is funded through the Air Districts Transportation
   Fund for Clean Air (TFCA).

   For your vehicle to be eligible for the Vehicle Buy Back program, it
   must meet the Vehicle Status Requirements and the Vehicle Functional
   and Equipment Inspection described below.

   If you feel that your vehicle can meet the Vehicle Status Requirements
   and the Vehicle Functional and Equipment Eligibility Inspection, call
   an Air District contractor to schedule an appointment to sell your
   vehicle.
