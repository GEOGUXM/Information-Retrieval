                    Local Planning Assistance - Overview


   "Local communities and the State must work cooperatively to ... protect
    the quality of life in California .... Well-planned growth is the best
       way to stimulate job creation, forge new transportation and housing
                  options, and continue California's economic prosperity."

                                                       Governor Gray Davis

      STATE AND LOCAL PLANNING CONCERNS are critical elements of OPR's
      statutory responsibilities. As the state's comprehensive planning
      agency, OPR has statutory responsibilities with regard to review of
      general plans, preparation of general plan guidelines, provision of
      technical assistance, and approval of general plan extension requests,
      including the imposition of conditions. OPR annually responds to
      several hundred requests for planning assistance, mostly from local
      government planning agencies.

      OPR fulfills its local planning assistance mandate both through direct
      assistance provided by professional planning staff and through
      preparation of technical assistance publications.
