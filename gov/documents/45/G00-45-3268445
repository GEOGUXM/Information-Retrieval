  Update Finances Before Military Calls
   __________________________________________________________________

   By PAMELA YIP (pyip@dallasnews.com ): The Dallas Morning News

   Before thousands of military personnel are deployed to carry out
   President Bush's promised war on terrorism, they need to make sure that
   things are financially squared away at home.

   "You can be professionally prepared, you can be administratively
   prepared, but if your personal house isn't in order, you are going to
   be distracted from the personal mission that you are going on," says
   Jim Moon, program manager of the Deployment Assistance Team at USAA in
   San Antonio. The financial services company serves current and former
   members of the military and their families.

   "You want to know that when you deploy, back home, your personal side
   is taken care of," he said. That includes several tasks:

     * Make a will. Name an executor to settle your estate in the event of
       your death. If you have young children, name a guardian for them.
     * Draw up a power of attorney. This authorizes someone to conduct
       your business affairs on your behalf. Make sure the person to whom
       you give this power is someone you really trust.
     * Make sure your financial accounts designate who will take them over
       if something should happen to you.

   If an account is in your name only, consider adding your spouse, a
   trusted friend or other family member so he or she can have access to
   the money to take care of financial issues that may arise during your
   absence.

   "They should make sure that their military pay is on direct deposit, so
   that the family has access to the dollars," says Joe Morrin, director
   of financial planning at First Command Financial Planning in Fort
   Worth, which does financial planning for military families.

     * Update beneficiaries on insurance policies and retirement plans.
     * Review your life insurance policy and make sure your coverage
       matches your family's needs.

   The Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance program provides policies of
   up to $250,000 to those on active duty, reservists and others.

   For more information, call the Department of Veterans Affairs'
   Insurance Center at 1-800-669-8477 or check out
   http://www.insurance.va.gov.

     * If no one will be driving your car while you're gone, tell your
       auto insurance company. You may be able to drop some coverage and
       save money.

   "You're trying to find those changes that could occur as a result of
   deploying and becoming mobilized, and trying to find ways to reduce the
   stress financially," Mr. Moon says.

     * Keep as much savings as you can. Mr. Moon recommends saving at
       least six months' worth of salary.

   "Six months is about the time you may be deployed if you're a
   reservist," he says.

   When you have to leave your civilian job to report for armed services
   duty, you may experience a dramatic drop in pay.

   "There's a financial change that people need to be aware of if they're
   in the reserves," Mr. Moon says. "And they need to prepare for that."

   The law doesn't require your employer to keep paying you while you're
   on active duty.

   But it does require employers to offer you the same or equivalent
   employment when you return, Mr. Morrin says.

   Many companies will pay a salary differential to someone called to
   active duty, says Jeanne Glorioso, a certified financial planner at
   Frost National Bank.

   "This would be the difference between their regular salary and military
   pay, if military pay is less than their normal salary," she says.

     * Pay off as much debt as you can before leaving.

   However, if you have lingering debt, you may qualify for protection
   under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940.

   The act was passed by Congress to provide protection for individuals
   entering or called to active duty in the military. It's intended to
   postpone or suspend certain civil obligations to enable service members
   to devote their full attention to duty.

   The protection begins on the date you enter active duty and generally
   ends within 30 to 90 days after the date of discharge.

   The act also provides relief from high interest rates.

   For example, if prior to entering service, you take out a loan with an
   interest rate of more than 6 percent, you won't be obligated to pay the
   interest in excess of 6 percent during any part of military service.

   But you're not entirely home free.

   You get the protection only if your ability to pay the loan has been
   "materially affected" by your service in the military.

   "If you're a doctor, and you're a sergeant in the reserves and you have
   to give up your doctor's pay to go to active duty, you're materially
   affected," Mr. Morrin says.

   However, if you're earning $3,000 a month at your civilian job and your
   military pay and allowances also total $3,000 a month, "you probably
   have not been materially affected, so you're not granted relief under
   the act," he says.

   The act protects military members from "unfair or adverse credit
   actions, foreclosures, excessive interest rates," Mr. Morrin says.

   Relief under the act "has to be requested and they have to honor it,"
   he says.

   _Relief.htm.

   Consumer debt shouldn't be more than 15 percent of your gross monthly
   income, Mr. Moon says.

   "They need to forecast an income which may be lower than their civilian
   job and salary and think about how to handle the debt with a reduced
   income," says Lee Montgomery, a First Command agent and representative
   in Dallas.
