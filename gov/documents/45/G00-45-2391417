   About CDA

   The California Department of Aging serves as both a unifying force for
   services to seniors and adults with functional impairments and as a
   focal point for federal, state and local agencies which serve the
   elderly and adults with functional impairments in California.  It
   fulfills the goals outlined in the Older Americans Act and also acts as
   an advocate for seniors and adults with functional impairments by
   striving to develop an environment which respects and values the
   state's older residents and adults with functional impairments.

   As the designated State Unit on Aging, the California Department of
   Aging is part of the California Health and Human Services Agency.  The
   Department administers Older Americans Act programs for supportive
   services, in-home services, congregate and home-delivered meals and a
   system of multipurpose senior centers.  It also administers the program
   for community service employment;  programs for advocacy and
   protection; and programs which provide health insurance counseling,
   case management, Alzheimer's Day Care Resource Center and Adult Day
   Health Care services.  Further, it performs a wide range of functions
   related to advocacy, planning, coordination, interagency linkages,
   information sharing, brokering, monitoring and evaluation.  In its
   activities, the Department works closely with private and public sector
   aging advocates.
