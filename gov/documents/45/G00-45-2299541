   About this Web Site
   Introduction

   Welcome to the ARS National Programs web site.  This site is devoted to
   providing ARS customers and stakeholders with timely,
   in-depth information about the Agency's research efforts.

   The site is organized around 4 perspectives:
     * Programs
     * People
     * Places (Locations)
     * Projects & Publication Submissions

   Each of the '4 Ps' represents a view of ARS research and related
   information.  These are all linked together and allow the viewer to
   either cut across to related information or "drill down" to very
   specific information.
