                            No-Regrets Remodeling

   In addition to giving you more space or the latest conveniences,
   thoughtful remodels can deliver big savings on your utility bills and
   make your house much more comfortable. It's important to take a look at
   the whole house for energy-saving possibilities before construction
   gets underway. No-Regrets Remodeling (published by the folks at Home
   Energy Magazine) covers the house from roof to basement and everywhere
   in between, and shows you all the possibilities for improvements and
   big energy savings.
