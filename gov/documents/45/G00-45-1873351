                     Minority Scientists / Institutions

   There are many opportunities for minority scientists in both the Cancer
       Training Branch (CTB) (this website) and the Comprehensive Minority
       Biomedical Branch (CMBB). The NCI staff from both of these units
       work very closely together in advising and counseling potential
       applicants and helping them choose the best options for training
       and career development support. The CMBB also focuses on helping
       Minority Serving Institutions to become involved in Cancer
       Research. We hope you will make inquiries to either the CTB or the
       CMBB, but first explore the special programs in the CMBB by
       clicking on Minority Opportunities.
