    September 28-29, 2001

   Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories, under the sponsorship of
   DOEs Office of Basic Energy Sciences, are developing a collaborative
   nanoscience user facility, the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies
   (CINT). The distinguishing characteristic of the Center is its emphasis
   on exploring the path from scientific discovery to the integration of
   nanostructures into the micro- and macroworlds. Integration is key to
   the development and exploitation of nanomaterials and the scientific
   challenges that it poses are at the heart of CINTs mission. The CINT
   facility will contain a Flexible Fabrication Laboratory, clean rooms,
   office space for visitors and collaborators, and state-of-the-art
   facilities supporting the four scientific thrust areas in Nanophotonics
   & Nanoelectronics, Nanomechanics, Nano-Bio-Micro Interfaces, and
   Complex Functional Materials. CINT will also connect users to
   specialized capabilities at both Sandia and Los Alamos, including the
   Los Alamos Neutron Science Center, National High-Magnetic Field
   Laboratory, Microelectronics Development Laboratory, Compound
   Semiconductor Research Laboratory, and DOE/High Performance Computing
   platforms, through gateways on each of the Laboratories campuses.
   Through its central facility and gateways, CINT scientists from each
   laboratory will collaborate with visitors from universities,
   laboratories, and industry. All of the capabilities of CINT will be
   available to the scientific community through this collaborative
   process.

   The CINT organizing team invites you to participate in a Planning
   Workshop to be held in Albuquerque, NM, on September 28 and 29, 2001.
   The purpose of this workshop is to introduce the CINT concept for
   nanoscience exploration and user outreach and to allow the community to
   join with us as we shape our plan to achieve this vision. In
   particular, we seek input on equipment and expertise to address our
   scientific thrusts, facilities design that will encourage
   cross-disciplinary collaboration, and an outreach interface that will
   make it easy for collaborators to interact with this unique Center. Our
   program will begin with plenary lectures aimed at identifying key
   issues in nanoscience including integration across different length
   scales and disciplines, educating and training the next generation of
   scientists and engineers, and facilitating the transition from
   nanoscience discovery to new technology. We will describe our Center
   concept and plans to address these challenges and then move to a series
   of Breakout Sessions that will allow participants the opportunity to
   provide recommendations that will be incorporated into our Center
   planning and development process.
