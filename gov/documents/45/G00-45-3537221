                     Web Site Accessibility/Section 508

   USDA is committed to making its web sites accessible to all USDA
   customers and employees. All of the agency web sites are undergoing
   review and redesign as necessary to ensure that they meet or exceed the
   requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

   Many of our FSIS web pages currently meet the Section 508 accessibility
   standards. FSIS continues to work on making all web pages accessible.
   Thank you very much for your patience through this redesign process. If
   you have any comments or suggestions for improvement, please contact
   the webmaster of this page by e-mailing fsis.webmaster@usda.gov.

   Users of assistive technology who require documents in alternative
   formats should contact the subject matter experts listed on the page in
   question, or send e-mail to fsis.webmaster@usda.gov.
