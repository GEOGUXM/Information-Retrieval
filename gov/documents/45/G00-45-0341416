   The mission of Northern Prairie's Grasslands Ecosystem Initiative is to
   work with others to assess the biotic resources of the Great Plains, to
   facilitate information sharing among agencies, organizations, and
   individuals, and to synthesize that information. To further that goal,
   the Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center is striving to make
   information on the biotic resources of the Great Plains more widely
   available to decision-makers, resource managers, scientists, and the
   public. This Web site serves as a medium to provide that information.

   Because of our research emphasis, many of the resources listed here
   stress information about resources in North Dakota and the Great
   Plains. However, many of the resources also pertain to the entire
   United States, as well as to Canada, Mexico, and occasionally other
   countries. We are continually looking for new resources to add to our
   site. If you have or know of material that you would like to see
   included, please contact us as indicated below.

   There are three tags added to selected resources:

   New! -- If you visit our site often, this tag will alert you to the
          newer resources on this page.

   Update! -- This tag will alert you to resources that have recently been
          changed or revised.

   Searchable -- This tag identifies databases that can be searched using
          an input form.

   Contributions: If you have information that you feel is appropriate for
   this web site, and would like Northern Prairie to consider having it
   served, please feel free to contact:
