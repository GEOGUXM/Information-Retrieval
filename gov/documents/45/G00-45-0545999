   Communication

   One of the powerful roles that the Internet can play is to enable
   members of an electronic community to share information, resolve
   technical issues, and publish results. The MUTCD Millennium Edition Web
   site is structured to promote 2-way communication. There is a mailing
   list and an online discussion group. The mailing list is essentially a
   form of email that affords a quick exchange of information. Most of us
   routinely use email to communicate with colleagues and other
   professional associates. The discussion group, although it can be used
   like a mailing list, is intended to support the focused and facilitated
   collection and exchange of information and/or knowledge that addresses
   specific concerns or issues of those concerned with applying and
   maintaining traffic control devices.
