                             & REGISTRATION FEES

      IMPORTANT: HHSDC has contracted with four vendors to provide this
     training. Currently we have classes from KPMG Consulting scheduled.
    Other vendors will be added as we develop our new training schedules
   for 2002. We recommend that you select one vendor and enroll in as many
   of that vendor's courses as you need. However, if necessary you may mix
         and match to achieve the best result for yourself and your
                      organization. Please refer to the
                            course descriptions.

    Note on course differences: The vendors' courses of similar title are
   also similar in content. Differences in course length are due partly to
     each vendor's particular approach to HIPAA training, and partly to
                      their individual course designs.

   HIPAA Overview is highly recommended before attending any other course,
                            regardless of vendor.

                All prices listed are per student per class.
