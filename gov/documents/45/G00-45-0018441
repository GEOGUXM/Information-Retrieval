                                  Overview

   To allow the use of the Globus toolkit from python I've been working on
   using SWIG to generate the necessary interface code. Eventually this
   should allow the use of the entire Globus toolkit from higher level
   scripting languages like python. Currently a substantial subset of the
   Globus toolkit has been wrapped.

                                    Goals

     * Provide a clean object-oriented interface to the Globus toolkit.
     * Provide similar performance to using the underlying C code as much
       as possible.
     * Minimize the number of changes necessary when aspects of Globus
       change.
     * Where possible, make Globus as natural to use from Python as
       possible. For example, the gassFile module allows the manipulation
       of remote GASS files as Python file objects.

                                Requirements

     * Python2.0 and up. It should work with earlier versions, but has not
       been tested.
     * The Globus 2.0 beta build of the Globus toolkit. Some parts of the
       wrapper will work with the Globus 1.1.3 release, but most of the
       data transfer functionality is based on the new gsiftp code.

   This code is presented as pre-alpha quality code. Any comments,
   complaints, suggestions should be sent to Keith Jackson.
