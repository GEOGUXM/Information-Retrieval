   Argonne National Laboratory's Division of Educational Programs (DEP)
   supports IAEA efforts by assisting the Expert section of their
   Technical Cooperation (TC) department in the recruitment of qualified
   US experts.  One facet of this effort is the maintenance of the
   official name, address, and specialty database for experts wishing to
   participate in the IAEA's TC efforts.  There is a constant search for
   qualified experts in all nuclear-related disciplines (from nuclear
   medicine to reactor physics).
   Types of Projects
   There are two types of projects within the IAEA: 1) Regular Core
   projects, and 2) Footnote a/ projects.  The Core projects are those
   projects which are funded by the IAEA out of their regular annual
   budget.  The second type of project, the Footnote a/ project, is funded
   directly by a donor country.  Footnote /a projects can have special
   requirements attached to them.  The US supports Footnote /a projects
   with these requirements:

   [expbul1a.gif] Countries receiving the project must be signatures of
                  the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty (NPT);
   [expbul1a.gif] All equipment must come from US manufactures, and
   [expbul1a.gif] All experts must be US citizens.

   Since Core projects do not have these requirements, IAEA does much of
   the recruitment for these missions.  Experts are recruited from all
   over the world.  DEP assists the IAEA when they have a difficulty
   recruiting for these projects and helping to arrange a mission if the
   expert is chosen from the US.
   The Footnote a/ projects are where DEP spends most of its recruiting
   efforts.  Usually the US funds 15-25 projects every year, each
   requiring 1-3 experts.  Since the experts must be US citizens, the IAEA
   asks DEP to recommend an expert for a mission.  In most cases, this
   recommendation is based on the experts listed in DEP's Expert database.
