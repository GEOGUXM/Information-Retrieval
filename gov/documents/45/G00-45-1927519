   The U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) EROS Data Center (EDC) was
   requested by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)
   Greater Horn of Africa Task Force to analyze factors affecting food
   security in the Greater Horn of Africa region. The USGS analysis was
   provided under agreement with USAID's Famine Early Warning System
   (FEWS) Project. EDC used the FEWS database archived at the EROS Data
   Center to analyze and present information for the ten country region
   comprising Burundi, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda,
   Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda.
   Integration and analyses of natural resource and socio-economic data
   provide a general overview of food security for the expanding
   population of the Greater Horn of Africa. This information is necessary
   to understand current and potential food deficits and surpluses, and to
   develop strategies to enhance food security. In response to USAID's
   requirements, the USGS produced image maps, thematic maps, and
   statistics for regional analysis. Only generalized maps and ancillary
   data were uniformly available for the ten countries. However, results
   reveal regions of high inter-annual climatic variability, variations in
   agricultural land potentials and current uses, and differing amounts of
   population pressures.
