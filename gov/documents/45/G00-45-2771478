           Managing Offsite Response Interfaces - An Introduction
                             (Course #ORI-100D)
                        Wednesday, November 14, 2001
                            12 noon - 3:30 PM EST

      What you'll learn
      This 3.5-hour, "100-level" course addresses the establishment of
      interfaces between organizations for the purpose of emergency response.
      Course content is based on DOE O 151.1 and DOE Guide 151.1-1 Volume
      III. This introduction offers a timely overview of the DOE directives
      and guidance governing the management of offsite response interfaces.
      An expert panel consisting of three site representatives will address
      course material, case studies, and participants' questions or concerns.

      As we learned September 11, 2001, we never know where we will have to
      operate. The better our offsite response interfaces are, the better
      prepared we will be to respond. stions for conducting such an analysis,
      including the use of available software.

      Who will benefit
      This training is intended for DOE managers, contractors, and any
      personnel with responsibility for planning, preparedness, and response
      to emergencies affecting DOE sites, facilities, and activities. Other
      personnel who should be invited to attend include off-site agency
      personnel who may be involved in establishing and maintaining DOE
      offsite response interfaces.

      Course Objectives
      By the end of the broadcast, students will be able to identify the
      following:

        * Requirements of DOE O 151.1 for establishing and maintaining
          offsite response interfaces.
        * The definition of "offsite interface."
        * The purpose and need for offsite response interfaces.
        * Concepts for effective offsite response interfaces.
