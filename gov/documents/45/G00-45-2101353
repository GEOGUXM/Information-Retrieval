   Disparities (NCMHD) is to lead, coordinate, support, and assess the NIH
   effort to reduce and ultimately eliminate health disparities. In this
   effort NCMHD will conduct and support basic, clinical, social, and
   behavioral research, promote research infrastructure and training,
   foster emerging programs, disseminate information, and reach out to
   minority and other health disparity communities.

   Vision
   The NCMHD envisions an America in which all populations will have an
   equal opportunity to live long, healthy and productive lives.
