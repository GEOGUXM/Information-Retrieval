Popular FOIA Requests

   Popular FOIA documents are those that have been the subject of previous
   requests and appear to be of broad public interest. These documents are
   listed throughout the Web site. Where possible, full databases have
   been constructed for Web access. These include databases showing
   Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) Performance Evaluations, enforcement
   actions (including removals/prohibitions) taken against bankers and
   national banks, and the Weekly Bulletin, which lists all corporate
   applications received by the OCC nationwide and is updated weekly. As
   corporate applications become available electronically, they will be
   posted here. Requests for these should be directed to
