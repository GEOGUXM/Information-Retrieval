Heirloom Birth Certificate Ordering Instructions

   Image of the Heirloom Birth Certificate - 5484KB

   Celebrate a new life with the Washington State Heirloom Birth
   Certificate. The Heirloom Birth Certificate is the perfect gift for
   baby showers, birthdays, adoptions, graduations, anniversaries  even
   retirements!

   The attractive 8 1/2" x 14" certificate is a legal, official document.
   It includes the individuals name, date and place of birth, as well as
   the name and birthplace of the parent(s). It is signed by the Governor
   and the State Registrar, and is printed in full color. The Heirloom
   Birth Certificate is a beautiful, permanent keepsake for anyone born in
   the State of Washington.

   Purchasing an Heirloom Birth Certificate helps to protect Washingtons
   most valuable resource  children. For each $25 purchase of an Heirloom
   Birth Certificate, $14.50 is tax-deductible. More than half of the
   certificates cost benefits the Washington Childrens Trust Fund
   (managed by the Washington Council for Prevention of Child Abuse and
   Neglect), that supports community-based programs that strengthen
   families.

   Heirloom Certificates can only be ordered through the State Center for
   Health Statistics.

   You must have EXACT information to order:
    1. Name at Birth
    2. Date of Birth (m/d/y)
    3. City or county of birth
    4. Fathers full name.
    5. Mothers full maiden name
    6. Your current name
    7. Your current address
    8. Day time phone number with area code.

   Certificates Ordered By Mail

   Since the Heirloom requires special processing, it normally takes 6 to
   8 weeks to receive an Heirloom birth certificate. The fee for each
   certified copy is 25 US dollars. Make checks/ money orders payable to
   Department of Health. The mailing address is:
   Department of Health
   Center for Health Statistics
   P.O. Box 9709
   Olympia WA 98507-9709.

   The Birth Certificate order form may be downloaded and printed, if you
   prefer. (Requires free Acrobat Reader®)

   Certificates Ordered via Drop Box

   The Center for Health Statistics cannot provide over-the-counter,
   same-day service, but does have a place in Olympia where customers may
   place their request and fee in a drop box.  It normally takes 6 to 8
   weeks to receive an Heirloom birth certificate.

   The drop box is located in Olympia, Washington at 1112 SE Quince
   Street.  The drop box is located inside the building and is accessible
   Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. For further
