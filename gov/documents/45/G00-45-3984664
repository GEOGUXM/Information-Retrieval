         Large-Scale Scientific and Engineering Design Optimization

     (Funded in part by the Mathematical, Information, and Computational
               Sciences Division of the Department of Energy.)

                                 Description

    Nonlinear optimization problems arise in a wide range of science and
    engineering applications at Sandia. These traditionally include such
      areas as optimal design and control, computational chemistry, and
   materials characterization. In addition, we are starting to encounter a
    new generation of problems arising from model-based safety assessment
      applications developed under the Accelerated Strategic Computing
         Initiative (ASCI). Optimization problems arising from these
      applications often require running a complex, PDE-based computer
     simulation in order to compute a function value. As a result, they
        present many challenges to optimization algorithms, including
    computationally expensive function evaluations, low-accuracy function
     values, and lack of analytic gradients. The same may be true of the
      constraints. In this situation, the constraints are likely to be
      nonlinear, and while there are good methods for bound and linear
     constraints, handling nonlinear constraints is a difficult problem.
   Furthermore, it may not be possible to quantify all of the constraints.
    For example, a function evaluation could fail for a particular set of
      parameters. This is a type of constraint that cannot be described
    mathematically and that must be handled on the fly. Other issues that
      are becoming increasingly important include non-convex functions,
   non-smooth functions, uncertainty in the input parameters, and multiple
                           levels of parallelism.

    Our goals are to address the challenges described here by developing
   nonlinear optimization algorithms that are both theoretically sound and
    computationally efficient and to incorporate them in object-oriented
                             software libraries.
