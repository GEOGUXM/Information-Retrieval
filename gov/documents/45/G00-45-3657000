                            The MSHA Library Search

Field Name: Call Number

   When you enter criteria in the Call Number field, you are searching all
   entries in the Call Number Index, which contains all of the Library of
   Congress Catalog Number entries. Use an asterisk (*) for a wildcard.

   The following list describes the test operators that appear in the
   droplist box to the right of the Call Number field label.

        contains the phrase
                Searches for all keywords and stopwords in exact order and
                position.

        contains in order
                Searches for all keywords in exact order and position.

        contains all
                Searches for all keywords in any order.

        contains any
                Searches for any keywords in any order.

        equals
                Searches for a value that matches your search value.

        is not
                Searches for a value that does not match your search
                value. (This test operator is for short text fields only.)

   Search Examples

   Searching multiple fields:
   Choose appropriate field connector from droplist box at the bottom of
   the search form.

   Sort Options:
   You may sort your search results by any of the fields in the droplist
   box at the bottom of the search form. You may also sort them in either
   ascending or descending order. If you select $RANK as the sort
   criterion, then the documents will be sorted according to how many hits
   were found in each. (A hit is a term in the document that matches the
   search value you specified.) If you keep the default value of NONE,
   then the documents will not be sorted.

   Note: When you specify $RANK for the Sort By box, the system will list
   the documents in descending order no matter what value you have
   selected in the Sort Order box.
