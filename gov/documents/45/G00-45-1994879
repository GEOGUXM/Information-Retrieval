                         FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

   Where do dietitians work in the Public Health Service (PHS)
   Commissioned Corps?

   The nearly 80 officers in the dietetics category in the PHS
   Commissioned Corps work throughout the Department of Health and Human
   Services (HHS) and in other Federal agencies/programs.  The majority of
   dietitians are assigned to the following:
     * Indian Health Service (IHS) (49%);
     * National Institutes of Health (NIH) (15%);

   What are the entry requirements?

   You must:
     * be a U.S. citizen;
     * be under 44 years of age (age may be offset by prior active-duty
       Uniformed Service time and/or civil service experience in a Public
       Health Service agency at a PHS site at a level commensurate with
       the duties of a commissioned officer);
     * have served less than 8 years of active duty if you are/were a
       member of another Uniformed Service (click here to access the
       Former/Current Uniformed Service members section);
     * meet medical requirements; and
     * pass an initial suitability investigation.

   In addition, you must have earned a:
     * bachelor's degree;
     * master's degree (with no qualifying bachelor's degree); or
     * doctoral degree (with no qualifying bachelor's degree) from a U.S.
       regionally-accredited college or university with a major in Foods
       and Nutrition, Dietetics, Institution Management, Public Health
       Nutrition, Food Science, Sports Nutrition, or Animal Nutrition.

   The minimum academic requirements are completion of a current Didactic
   Program in Dietetics (Plan IV/V) as approved by the American Dietetic
   Association (ADA).  Applicants must also present verification of
   completion of an ADA-accredited/approved pathway:
     * Accredited Dietetic Internship Program
     * Accredited Coordinated Program
     * Approved Pre-professional Practice Program
     * *Qualifying experience with an advanced degree
     * *3-year Pre-planned Experience Program

   *After June 30, 1993, these programs were no longer an approved ADA
   pathway.  In addition, a current, unrestricted, and valid registration
   by the Commission on Dietetic Registration of the American Dietetic
   Association (ADA) is required.

   What if I just graduated from dietitian school?  May I still apply?

   New dietetics graduates may be called to duty as a commissioned officer
   for a limited tour not to exceed 1 year.  Evidence of licensure is
   required for removal of the limitation and for retention in the Corps.
   An unlicensed graduate will function only in a closely supervised
   setting until he/she becomes licensed.

   How much will I earn?

   Compensation varies, depending on factors such as grade/rank, years of
   training and experience (T & E) in your profession, base pay entry date
   (BPED), geographic location of your duty station, and dependency
   status.  The minimum starting pay grade/rank for a dietitian officer in
   the PHS Commissioned Corps is the O-2 (LTJG).  T & E credit is
   determined by undergraduate education, graduate training, and
   experience considered to be professionally qualifying for appointment
   to the particular category.  It is earned for time spent after receipt
   of the qualifying degree in degree-related activities.  This could be:
     * employment (paid or volunteer)
     * research
     * further training in your field
     * teaching at college or university level
     * allied and relevant graduate studies and/or research

   For further information on pay, click
   Pay on the home page.  For further information on T & E and how an
   officer's starting rank is calculated, click the section on the
   Training and Experience Date.

   Am I eligible for any bonuses and/or special pay?

   Yes, dietitians are eligible for the monthly special pay, Non-Physician
   Board Certified Pay (NPBCP).

   NPBCP is a monthly special pay for officers who possess specialty board
   certification in Pediatric Nutrition, Renal Nutrition, Metabolic
   Nutrition, or as a Fellow of the American Dietetic Association (ADA)
   and who have a post baccalaureate degree in a dietetic/nutrition
   discipline (MPH degrees are not NPBCP qualifying degrees).  The
   creditable service entry date (CSED) reflects the officer's years of
   active duty as a dietitian officer in any of the Uniformed Services.
   Rates range from $2,000 to $5,000 annually based on years of CSED.  In
   order to receive NPBCP, you must provide documentation of the
   certification.

   All special pays are taxable income.

   representing all PHS and non-PHS programs/agencies.  It provides advice
   and consultation to the PHS Surgeon General, the PHS Chief Dietetics
   Officer and other leadership (such as agency/program heads).  If

   services, and an annual scientific meeting.  The annual meeting,
   usually held in late spring, is an excellent opportunity to meet
