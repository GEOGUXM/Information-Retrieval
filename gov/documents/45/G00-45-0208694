                     Tips For The Savvy Supplement User:
            Making Informed Decisions And Evaluating Information



     FDA, as well as health professionals and their organizations, receive
     many inquiries each year from consumers seeking health-related
     information, especially about dietary supplements. Clearly, people
     choosing to supplement their diets with herbals, vitamins, minerals, or
     other substances want to know more about the products they choose so
     that they can make informed decisions about them. The choice to use a
     dietary supplement can be a wise decision that provides health
     benefits. However, under certain circumstances, these products may be
     unnecessary for good health or they may even create unexpected risks.

     Given the abundance and conflicting nature of information now available
     about dietary supplements, you may need help to sort the reliable
     information from the questionable. Below are tips and resources that we
     hope will help you be a savvy dietary supplement user. The principles
     underlying these tips are similar to those principles a savvy consumer
     would use for any product.

   resources see Selected References.)


   Basic Points to Consider

     * Do I need to think about my total diet?
       Yes. Dietary supplements are intended to supplement the diets of
       some people, but not to replace the balance of the variety of foods
       important to a healthy diet. While you need enough nutrients, too
       much of some nutrients can cause problems. You can find information
       on the functions and potential benefits of vitamins and minerals,
       as well as upper safe limits for nutrients at the National Academy
       of Sciences Web site at:
       http://www.iom.edu/iom/iomhome.nsf/Pages/FNB+Reports .
     * Should I check with my doctor or healthcare provider before using a
       supplement?
       This is a good idea, especially for certain population groups.
       Dietary supplements may not be risk-free under certain
       circumstances. If you are pregnant, nursing a baby, or have a
       chronic medical condition, such as, diabetes, hypertension or heart
       disease, be sure to consult your doctor or pharmacist before
       purchasing or taking any supplement. While vitamin and mineral
       supplements are widely used and generally considered safe for
       children, you may wish to check with your doctor or pharmacist
       before giving these or any other dietary supplements to your child.
       If you plan to use a dietary supplement in place of drugs or in
       combination with any drug, tell your health care provider first.
       Many supplements contain active ingredients that have strong
       biological effects and their safety is not always assured in all
       users. If you have certain health conditions and take these
       products, you may be placing yourself at risk.
          + Some supplements may interact with prescription and
            over-the-counter medicines.
            Taking a combination of supplements or using these products
            together with medications (whether prescription or OTC drugs)
            could under certain circumstances produce adverse effects,
            some of which could be life-threatening. Be alert to
            advisories about these products, whether taken alone or in
            combination. For example: Coumadin (a prescription medicine),
            ginkgo biloba (an herbal supplement), aspirin (an OTC drug)
            and vitamin E (a vitamin supplement) can each thin the blood,
            and taking any of these products together can increase the
            potential for internal bleeding. Combining St. John's Wort
            with certain HIV drugs significantly reduces their
            effectiveness. St. John's Wort may also reduce the
            effectiveness of prescription drugs for heart disease,
            depression, seizures, certain cancers or oral contraceptives.
          + Some supplements can have unwanted effects during surgery:
            It is important to fully inform your doctor about the
            vitamins, minerals, herbals or any other supplements you are
            taking, especially before elective surgery. You may be asked
            to stop taking these products at least 2-3 weeks ahead of the
            procedure to avoid potentially dangerous supplement/drug
            interactions -- such as changes in heart rate, blood pressure
            and increased bleeding - that could adversely affect the
            outcome of your surgery.
          + Adverse effects from the use of dietary supplements should be
            reported to MedWatch:
            You, your health care provider, or anyone may report a serious
            adverse event or illness directly to FDA if you believe it is
            related to the use of any dietary supplement product, by
            calling FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088, by fax at 1-800-FDA-0178 or
            reporting on-line at: http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/how.htm. FDA
            would like to know whenever you think a product caused you a
            serious problem, even if you are not sure that the product was
            the cause, and even if you do not visit a doctor or clinic. In
            addition to communicating with FDA on-line or by phone, you
            may use the MedWatch form available from the FDA Web site.
     * Who is responsible for ensuring the safety and efficacy of dietary
       supplements?
       Under the law, manufacturers of dietary supplements are responsible
       for making sure their products are safe before they go to market.
       They are also responsible for determining that the claims on their
       labels are accurate and truthful. Dietary supplement products are
       not reviewed by the government before they are marketed, but FDA
       has the responsibility to take action against any unsafe dietary
       supplement product that reaches the market. If FDA can prove that
       claims on marketed dietary supplement products are false and
       misleading, the agency may take action also against products with
       such claims.


   Tips on Searching the Web for Information on Dietary Supplements

   When searching on the Web, try using directory sites of respected
   organizations, rather than doing blind searches with a search engine.
   Ask yourself the following questions: :

     * Who operates the site?
       Is the site run by the government, a university, or a reputable
       medical or health-related association (e.g., American Medical
       Association, American Diabetes Association, American Heart
       Association, National Institutes of Health, National Academies of
       Science, or U.S. Food and Drug Administration)? Is the information
       written or reviewed by qualified health professionals, experts in
       the field, academia, government or the medical community?
     * What is the purpose of the site?
       Is the purpose of the site to objectively educate the public or
       just to sell a product? Be aware of practitioners or organizations
       whose main interest is in marketing products, either directly or
       through sites with which they are linked. Commercial sites should
       clearly distinguish scientific information from advertisements.
       Most nonprofit and government sites contain no advertising; and
       access to the site and materials offered are usually free.
     * What is the source of the information and does it have any
       references?
       Has the study been reviewed by recognized scientific experts and
       published in reputable peer-reviewed scientific journals, like the
       New England Journal of Medicine? Does the information say "some
       studies showÂ…" or does it state where the study is listed so that
       you can check the authenticity of the references? For example, can
       the study be found in the National Library of Medicine's database
       of literature citations (PubMed link -
       http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/ )
     * Is the information current?
       Check the date when the material was posted or updated. Often new
       research or other findings are not reflected in old material, e.g.,
       side effects or interactions with other products or new evidence
       that might have changed earlier thinking. Ideally, health and
       medical sites should be updated frequently.
     * How reliable is the Internet or e-mail solicitations?
       While the Internet is a rich source of health information, it is
       also an easy vehicle for spreading myths, hoaxes and rumors about
       alleged news, studies, products or findings. To avoid falling prey
       to such hoaxes, be skeptical and watch out for overly emphatic
       language with UPPERCASE LETTERS and lots of exclamation points!!!!
       Beware of such phrases such as: "This is not a hoax" or "Send this
       to everyone you know."


   More Tips and To-Do's

     * Ask yourself: Does it sound too good to be true?
       Do the claims for the product seem exaggerated or unrealistic? Are
       there simplistic conclusions being drawn from a complex study to
       sell a product? While the Web can be a valuable source of accurate,
       reliable information, it also has a wealth of misinformation that
       may not be obvious. Learn to distinguish hype from evidence-based
       science. Nonsensical lingo can sound very convincing. Also, be
       skeptical about anecdotal information from persons who have no
       formal training in nutrition or botanicals, or from personal
       testimonials (e.g. from store employees, friends, or online chat
       rooms and message boards) about incredible benefits or results
       obtained from using a product. Question these people on their
       training and knowledge in nutrition or medicine.
     * Think twice about chasing the latest headline.
       Sound health advice is generally based on a body of research, not a
       single study. Be wary of results claiming a "quick fix" that depart
       from previous research and scientific beliefs. Keep in mind science
       does not proceed by dramatic breakthroughs, but by taking many
       small steps, slowly building towards a consensus. Furthermore, news
       stories, about the latest scientific study, especially those on TV
       or radio, are often too brief to include important details that may
       apply to you or allow you to make an informed decision.
     * Check your assumptions about the following:
          + #1 Questionable Assumption Â–
            "Even if a product may not help me, it at least won't hurt
            me." It's best not to assume that this will always be true.
            When consumed in high enough amounts, for a long enough time,
            or in combination with certain other substances, all chemicals
            can be toxic, including nutrients, plant components, and other
            biologically active ingredients.
          + #2 Questionable Assumption Â–
            "When I see the term 'natural,' it means that a product is
            healthful and safe." Consumers can be misled if they assume
            this term assures wholesomeness, or that these food-like
            substances necessarily have milder effects, which makes them
            safer to use than drugs. The term "natural" on labels is not
            well defined and is sometimes used ambiguously to imply
            unsubstantiated benefits or safety. For example, many
            weight-loss products claim to be "natural" or "herbal" but
            this doesn't necessarily make them safe. Their ingredients may
            interact with drugs or may be dangerous for people with
            certain medical conditions.
          + #3 Questionable Assumption Â–
            " A product is safe when there is no cautionary information on
            the product label." Dietary supplement manufacturers may not
            necessarily include warnings about potential adverse effects
            on the labels of their products. If consumers want to know
            about the safety of a specific dietary supplement, they should
            contact the manufacturer of that brand directly. It is the
            manufacturer's responsibility to determine that the supplement
            it produces or distributes is safe and that there is
            substantiated evidence that the label claims are truthful and
            not misleading.
          + #4 Questionable Assumption Â–
            " A recall of a harmful product guarantees that all such
            harmful products will be immediately and completely removed
            from the marketplace." A product recall of a dietary
            supplement is voluntary and while many manufacturers do their
            best, a recall does not necessarily remove all harmful
            products from the marketplace.
     * Contact the manufacturer for more information about the specific
       product that you are purchasing.
       If you cannot tell whether the product you are purchasing meets the
       same standards as those used in the research studies you read
       about, check with the manufacturer or distributor. Ask to speak to
       someone who can address your questions, some of which may include:
         1. What information does the firm have to substantiate the claims
            made for the product? Be aware that sometimes firms supply
            so-called "proof" of their claims by citing undocumented
            reports from satisfied consumers, or "internal" graphs and
            charts that could be mistaken for evidence-based research.
         2. Does the firm have information to share about tests it has
            conducted on the safety or efficacy of the ingredients in the
            product?
         3. Does the firm have a quality control system in place to
            determine if the product actually contains what is stated on
            the label and is free of contaminants?
         4. Has the firm received any adverse events reports from
            consumers using their products?
