      Real-time Modeling
        __________________________________________________________________

      Massive computer programs called numerical weather prediction models
      start with current weather observations and attempt to predict future
      weather. Through physics and dynamics, complex computer programs
      mathematically describe the atmosphere's behavior to provide forecasts
      of temperature, pressure, moisture, rainfall and winds. NSSL scientists
      are currently testing new parameterization schemes and including
      additional physical processes in the models. Other research includes
      development of new forecast models and ensemble forecasting techniques.

      Real-Time MM5 Simulations (Eastern U.S.)

      Real-time mesoscale model weather forecasts using the non-hydrostatic
      Penn State/NCAR mesoscale model (MM5) are being produced once a day at
      NSSL. One of the major differences between this version of MM5 and the
      operational Eta model is that MM5 uses a Kain-Fritsch convective
      parameterization scheme that was developed specifically for mesoscale
      modeling. The highlighted MM5 output fields are directed toward
      forecasting severe weather. Some of the parameters shown are
      experimental.

      Real-time modified Eta Model

      Real-time runs of the National Weather Service's operational Eta Model
      are being produced twice a day at NSSL. We have modified this model
      with the Kain-Fritsch convective parameterization scheme and 4th order
      horizontal diffusion in order to evaluate these potential improvements.

      Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF)

      This model is a collaborative effort between several universities,
      UCAR/NCAR, and the operational modeling centers at the Air Force and
      National Weather Service. Plans are for this model to become the next
      generation numerical weather prediction model. NSSL will begin running
      this model in the spring.
