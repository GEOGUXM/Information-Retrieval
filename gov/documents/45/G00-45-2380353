   About Navajo Area Indian Health Service

   Hogan The Navajo Area Indian Health Service (NAIHS) is responsible for
   the delivery of health services to American Indians in portions of the
   States of AZ, NM, Utah (a region known as the 4 corners Area of the
   US.) NAIHS is primarily responsible for healthcare to members of The
   Navajo Nation and Southern Band of San Juan Paiutes, but care to other
   Native Americans (Zuni, Hopi) is also provided. The Navajo Nation is
   the largest Indian tribe in the United States and has the largest
   reservation, which encompasses more than 25,000 square miles in
   Northeast Arizona, Northwest New Mexico, Southern Utah and Colorado,
   with three satellite locations in central New Mexico.
