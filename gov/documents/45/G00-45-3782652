     A Letter From The Administrator

   Welcome to our on-line publication of the Caseloads of the Courts of
   Washington. Statistical data contained in the state's Judicial
   Information System has been used to publish this comprehensive
   description of Washington's courts.

   From the caseload directory page you can access most-recent-month,
   year-to-date, and annual statistics for every superior court and most
   of the district and municipal courts in Washington State. Annual
   statistics are also available for the Supreme Court and Court of
   Appeals. Available statistics include: number of filings by type of
   case, number of proceedings by type of proceeding, number of
   dispositions by type of disposition, and many more. Five-year historic
   summaries are also shown, as are workload indicators. There is also a
   glossary of terms and an index of tables.

   From here you may proceed to the caseload directory, or to the online
   help page to learn more about viewing and printing caseload data. The
   information page will give you a description of the Washington State
   Court System, and explain how caseload data are collected and
   presented. You may also return to the Washington State Courts Home
   Page.

   We hope this on-line publication provides you with useful information.
   We also look forward to improving this publication in the future. If
   you have any questions or comments concerning the Caseloads of the
   Courts of Washington, call the OAC Research Unit at (360) 753-3365, or
   use the email address given on the information or online help page.
