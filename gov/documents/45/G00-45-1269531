   Principal site of the Phobos Web server is maintained at Brookhaven
   National Laboratory at http://www.phobos.bnl.gov

   In addition there is a  mirror site at http://phobosdb.chm.bnl.gov

   The mirror site is updated several times a day. All the modifications
   to the web site are performed at the main site and then copied to the
   mirror. The changes made directly at the mirror are NOT copied back to
   the main site. We also keep the latest log file.
