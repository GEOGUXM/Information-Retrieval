                          East Maui, or Haleakala--
                       A Potentially Hazardous Volcano

   When asked about Hawaiian volcanoes, most people imagine the Big Island
   and its eruptions at Kilauea or Mauna Loa volcanoes. But East Maui
   volcano has witnessed at least ten eruptions in the past 1,000 years,
   and numerous eruptions have occurred there in the past 10,000 years.
   Thus the volcano's long eruptive history and recent activity indicate
   that East Maui volcano will erupt in the future.

   Haleakala National Park is the most visited part of East Maui. The
   Hawaiian name Hale-a-ka-la (lit., house of the sun), is now nearly
   synonymous with the entire shield of East Maui volcano. Early
   Hawaiians, however, applied the name only to the summit area, the site
   where the demigod Maui snared the sun and forced it to slow its journey
   across the sky.

   The oldest lava flow exposed on East Maui is about 1.1 million years in
   age. It is part of a sequence of flows emplaced near the end of shield
   building on East Maui. The time estimated to build a volcano from ocean
   floor to the end of its shield-building stage is about 0.6 million
   years. East Maui volcano probably began its growth about 2.0 million
   years ago.

   Volcanism of the past 30,000 years on East Maui has been focused along
   the southwest and east rift zones. These two volcanic axes together
   form one gently curving arc that passes from La Perouse Bay (southwest
   flank of East Maui) through Haleakala Crater to Hana on the east flank.
   The alignment continues east beneath the ocean as Haleakala Ridge, one
   of the most sizable rift zones along the Hawaiian Islands volcanic
   chain. The on-land segment of this lengthy volcanic line of vents is
   the zone of greatest hazard for future lava flows and cindery ash.

   Most Recent Eruption
   Perhaps about A.D. 1790, but newly obtained radiocarbon ages suggest
   the most recent eruption probably occurred earlier, sometime between
   A.D. 1480 and 1600. (see Volcano Watch essay)

   Number of Historical Eruptions
   See recent eruption description above.

   Summit Crater
   A large topographic depression, Haleakala Crater, occupies the summit
   region of East Maui volcano. The crater is breached at its northwest
   and southeast corners by large valleys that drain to the north and
   south coasts, respectively. The crater originated by erosion, according
   to most published accounts and additional recent research.
     * Dimensions: 3.5 x 12 km, elongate east-west
     * Depth: 860 m
     * Estimated age: formed between 120,000 and 150,000 years ago (see
       Volcano Watch essay)

   Oldest Dated Rocks
   About 1.1 million years

   Estimated Age of On-land Eruptions
   Numerous small lava flows in past 30,000 years;
   slopes of volcano mantled by lava flows 700,000 to 150,000 years in
   age.

   Estimated Age of Inception of East Maui Volcano
   About 2.0 million years ago
