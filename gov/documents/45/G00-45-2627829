   The Near East/South Asia/Africa Division fosters mutual understanding
   between the United States and other countries in its regions through
   grants sponsoring international citizen exchange programs. Through this
   mechanism, the division promotes personal, professional, and
   institutional ties between private citizens and organizations in the
   United States and abroad, as well as by presenting U.S. history,
   society, art and culture in all of its diversity to overseas audiences.
