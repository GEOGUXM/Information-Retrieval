   Oct. 20: Personnel from USGS, Virginia state agencies (DEQ, VDMR),
   universities and private industry attended this field trip, led by
   Gerald Johnson, College of William and Mary; David Powars, USGS; and
   Scott Bruce, DEQ. Attendees visited sites that show the effects of the
   impact, 35 million years ago, of a comet or asteroid that fell into the
   Atlantic Ocean near Cape Charles. The bluffs in the photo are along the
   north bank of the James River, on the grounds of the historic Carter's
   Grove farm, just outside the outer rim of the impact crater. The bluffs
   reveal a geologic formation known as the Yorktown Formation. These
   strata reflect intermittent movement (faulting) around the buried rim
   of the impact structure.
