                            Montana Flood-Frequency
                            and Basin-Characteristic Data

     Flood-frequency data are based on recorded annual peak discharges
     through 1998. Peak discharges for specified frequencies (exceedance
     probabilities) were determined by fitting a log-Pearson Type 3
     probability distribution to base 10 logarithms of recorded annual peak
     discharges as described by the Interagency Advisory Committee on Water
     Data (1982, Guidelines for Determining Flood Flow Frequency--Bulletin
     17-B of the Hydrology Subcommittee: U.S. Geological Survey, Office of
     Water Data Coordination). Note: Data are provisional and user is
     responsible for assessment and interpretation of flood-frequency data.
     Most of the basin characteristic data were measured in the 1970s from
     the best-scale topographic maps available at the time. Some data, such
     as mean annual precipitation, soil index data, and mean January minimum
     temperatures, were compiled from maps prepared by other agencies.
     Channel widths were measured in the field by USGS personnel.
