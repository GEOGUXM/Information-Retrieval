                                    wgrib

   WGRIB is a program to manipulate, inventory and decode GRIB files. The
   program is known to work on machines ranging from 486s to Cray
   supercomputers. (One fellow even ported it to a 286!) The program is
   Y2K friendly (NCO Y2K testing procedure).

   wgrib (gributil) is an operational NCEP program. On the IBM/SP, it can
   be found at /nwprod/util/exec/wgrib,

   Highlights for v1.7.x:
     * scans entire file for grib messages (D. Haalman)
     Added German Weather Service (DWD) tables 201, 202, 203 and 2
       Support for triangular grid (Helmut P. Frank, DWD)
     fractional mb (NCEP local extension)
     added new levels
     updated NCEP operational GRIB table
     fixed thinned grids with bitmap
     NCEP ensemble support
     fixed -H option
     Support for the 3/6/12 hour forecast time units
     Fixed a bug with bitmap when the precision is greater than 24 bits.
       This is more of a theoretical problem as most people (NCEP and
       ECMWF) limit the precision to 16 bits and I can't imagine anyone
       using more than 24 bit of precision for any meteorological data.
       Thanks LB for finding the bug.
     Source code in a tar file. For people who want to read the source
       code before it is combined into wgrib.c.
     more time codes like SECONDS
     New or updated ECMWF grib tables: 128 129 130 131 140 150 160 170 180

   Highlights for v1.6.x:
     * fixed a problem with identifying 1997 Reanalysis files.
     fixed a problem with the GDS header in the -H option
     optional binary output of PDS and GDS (-H option)
     -d all (decode entire file)
     thinned grid support
     fix of my mis-interpretation on how year 2000 is stored in GRIB
     NCEP operational table
     updated documentation

   Under testing:
     * beta version

   Note: there were two definitions for SNOC and CWAT in the operational
   and Reanalysis grib tables. For the time being, I'm calling snow cover
   "SNOWC" and canopy water "CNWAT."

   To do:
     * ECMWF ensemble information

     How to Compile and (misc files)

   Source code:
     * C source code Netscape: shift+left_mouse_button, (If your browser
       alters the code, use anonymous ftp to download /pub/wgrib/wgrib.c)
     ftp://wesley.wwb.noaa.gov/pub/wgrib (FTP access: documentation, test
       files, etc.)
     wgrib.tar See above for source code. (For people who want to read or
       re-use the source code.)

   Compiled versions:
     * not all links are valid and compiled versions tend to be older
       versions
     Macintosh (thanks Franco)
     MS-DOS (compiled with gcc)
     Windows (compiled with gcc)
     SunOS (compiled with acc)

   Windows: find vs. grep and egrep

   You should use grep or egrep instead of the MS-DOS "find" command.
   The (e)grep command is more flexible and it is consistent with the
   documentation. Public domain versions exist for ms-dos, windows and
   Win32 machines. Personally I would look for a grep based on GNU source
   code. In your favorite internet search engine look for
   "+grep +gnu +windows".

   Future attractions:
     * gribw grib decode/encode library (beta testing)
     ECMWF ensemble meta data
