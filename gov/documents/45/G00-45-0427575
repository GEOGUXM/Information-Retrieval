               Complaints Initiating Adjudicatory Proceedings

   Any person may file with the Commission a sworn complaint alleging a
   violation of the Shipping Act of 1984 and may seek reparations for any
   injury caused by that violation or any other appropriate relief. The
   Commission's Office of the Secretary will serve the complaint on the
   named person or entity claimed to have violated the Act, thereby
   initiating an adjudicatory proceeding. Complaint proceedings fall into
   either of two categories, i.e., formal docket or informal docket.

   Formal dockets involve complaints seeking reparation in an amount in
   excess of $10,000 or some other form of relief. Formal dockets will be
   referred to an administrative law judge who will conduct such
   proceeding as may be necessary to hear and determine the merits of the
   complaint.Under the formal docket procedure, if an award of reparations
   is made, the complaining party may also ask for attorney's fees. Any
   party may appeal the judge's decision to the Commission, which also has
   the right to review such decision upon its own motion.

   Informal dockets involve claims of $10,000 or less and are referred to
   Settlement Officers for decision.This procedure does not allow an
   appeal to the Commission and does not provide for award of attorney's
   fees. This informal docket procedure should be distinguished from the
   non-adjudicatory informal complaint process administered by the
   Commission's Office of Consumer Complaints. The Commission's Office of
   the Secretary will furnish on request an information package explaining
   how to use both formal and informal docket procedures.
