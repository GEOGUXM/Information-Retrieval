   Summary

   When you visit our web site, we collect information about your visit,
   but nothing that identifies you personally. This information is
   retained for no more than a week and is then discarded. We collect
   information that personally identifies you only if you volunteer it by
   placing it on one of our forms used to collect public comment, to
   initiate a consumer complaint, to request public records, or to request
   an Operation Lifesaver presentation. This personally-identifying
   information is used only for the purpose for which it is collected.
   This information may be public record, and therefore subject to
   inspection and copying upon request. You may contact the UTC to review
   and correct any information we may have that identifies you personally.
   Details of each of these topics are included below.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Information Collected and How it is Used

   Information we collect if you only browse this site

   If you do nothing while at our web site but browse, read pages, or
   download information, we will gather and store certain information
   about your visit. This information does not identify you personally. We
   automatically collect and store the following information about your
   visit:
   1. The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used. The Internet
   Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your
   Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the
   Internet Protocol Address to direct Internet traffic to you. This
   address can be translated to determine the domain name of your service
   provider (e.g. xcompany.com or yourschool.edu);
   2. The type of browser and operating system you used;
   3. The date and time you visited this site;
   4. The web pages or services you accessed at this site; and
   5. The web site you visited prior to coming to this web site.

   The information we automatically collect or store is used by the UTC
   only to improve the content at our web site and to help us understand
   how people are using our services. Agency policy permits us to retain
   this information no longer than a week. We may retain summaries of this
   information for longer than a week, but with Internet Protocol Address
   removed.

   Information we collect if you volunteer it

   If during your visit to our web site you participate in a survey, send
   an email, or perform some other transaction on-line, the following
   additional information will be collected:
   1. The email address and contents of the email, for those who
   communicate with us via email.
   2. Information volunteered in response to a survey.
   3. Information volunteered through an on-line form for any other
   purpose.

   The information collected is not limited to text characters and may
   include audio, video, and graphic information formats you send us.

   We use your email to respond directly to you, to address issues you
   identify in your email, to further improve our web site, or to forward
   to another agency for appropriate action. Survey information is used to
   improve services delivered over the Web. Information from other on-line
   forms is used to gather information from you in support of the agency's
   work.

   There are four on-line forms on our web site by which we collect
   personal informaiton:

     The Operation Lifesaver Presentation Request form allows you to
   request an Operation Lifesaver Presentation for your group or
   organization. The information requested on the form is used to contact
   you and complete the arrangements for the presentation.

     The Public Participation Comment form allows you to submit a comment
   on an issue before the Commission. These comments become part of the
   public record of the proceeding and are used by the Commissioners and
   staff to make decisions in the matter.

     The Consumer Informal Complaint form allows you to submit a complaint
   about your utility company. The Consumer Affairs section will then
   contact you and begin the process of resolving your complaint.

     The Public Records Request form allows you to request copies of
   records held by the UTC. The information on the form is used to send
   you the records you request and to follow-up with you in the event
   there are questions about the details of your request.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Personal Information and Choice

   You may choose whether to provide personal information on-line.

   "Personal information" is information about a natural person that is
   readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information
   includes such things as an individual's name, address and phone number.
   A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal
   information.

   We do not collect personal information about you unless you voluntarily
   provide it to us by sending us email, participate in a survey, or
   complete an on-line form. You may choose not to contact us by email,
   participate in a survey or to provide any personal information using an
   on-line form. Your choice to not participate in these activities will
   not impair your ability to browse the UTC web site and read or download
   any information provided on the site.

   If personal information is requested on the web site or volunteered by
   the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it.
   However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and
   may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by
   state or federal law.

   If you believe that your information is being used for a purpose other
   than what was intended when submitted, you may contact the Public
   Records Officer, as shown in the Contact Information Section of this
   statement.

   Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information
   requested from or volunteered by children on-line or by email will be
   treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject
   to public access.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Public Access to Information

   In Washington, laws exist to ensure that state government is open and
   that the public has a right to access appropriate records and
   information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are
   exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve
   various needs, including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions are
   provided by both state and federal laws.

   All of the information collected at this site becomes public record
   that may be subject to inspection and copying by members of the public,
   unless an exemption in law exists. The provisions of RCW 42.17. 260(1)-
   Documents and Indexes to be Made Public state that:

   "Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available
   for public inspection and copying all public records, unless the record
   falls within the specific exemptions of subsection (6) of this section
   [RCW 42.17.260(6)], RCW 42.17.310, 42.17.315, or other statute which
   exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records. To
   the extent required to prevent an unreasonable invasion of personal
   privacy interests protected by RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315, an agency
   shall delete identifying details in a manner consistent with RCW
   42.17.310 and 42.17.315 when it makes available or publishes any public
   record; however, in each case, the justification for the deletion shall
   be explained fully in writing."

   In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and the Public
   Records Act or other law governing the agency's disclosure of records,
   the Public Records Act or other applicable law will be applied.

   Review and Correction of Personally-Identifiable Information

   You can review any personally-identifiable information we collect about
   you by using the information in the Contact Information section at the
   end of this notice. You may recommend changes to any of your
   personally-identifiable information which you believe to be inaccurate
   by submitting an email or written request that credibly shows the
   inaccuracy. We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity
   before granting access or making corrections. (RCW 43.105.310 -
   Accuracy, Integrity and Privacy of Records and Information)
