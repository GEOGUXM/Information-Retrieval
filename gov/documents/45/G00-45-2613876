   Public Event for SR-35 Columbia River Crossing Study Scheduled
   October 12, 2000

        Vancouver, Washington  -- The public is invited to an open house
        October 12, from 5 to 8 p.m. at the Hood River Inn, River View Room,
        to begin discussion of alternative Columbia River crossings. The Inn
        is located on the Columbia River at the south end of the Hood River
        Bridge, adjacent to exit 64, off I-84:

                   1108 E Marina Way
                   Hood River, OR 97031

                   541-386-2200

        The event is sponsored by the Southwest Washington Regional
        Transportation Council, in partnership with the Oregon and
        Washington Departments of Transportation and local cities and
        counties. The first phase of this effort was completed last year,
        resulting in vision and mission statements for the study and these
        possible alternative crossing locations:
        * Stanley Rock: connecting Koberg State Park to Bingen Point.
        * Low Corridor: approximately the same alignment as the current
          bridge.
        * High Corridor: approximately the same alignment as the current
          bridge but at a much higher elevation, connecting from Button
          Junction to Jewett Boulevard (SR141).
        * West Hood River Interchange: connecting on I-84 across the Columbia
          River to SR14.

        The second phase of the study is under the direction of the same
        public agencies who recently hired a consulting team headed by
        Parsons-Brinckerhoff to assist with the project. The outcome of the
        work will be an understanding of the potential benefits and
        drawbacks of a new or improved crossing, short and long term
        recommendations for improvements, and an implementation strategy.

        A steering committee of elected and appointed officials and a local
        advisory committee of citizens are being formed to help guide the
        study. In addition, throughout the project, residents and business
        owners on both sides of the river will have opportunities to be
        involved through community events, questionnaires, newsletters, a
        youth project, public displays and other means.
