    YOUR SERVICE AS A JUROR IS IMPORTANT: Jurors perform a vital role in
      the American system of justice. The protection of our rights and
    liberties is achieved primarily through the teamwork of our system of
    judge and jury working together in a common effort. Jury service is a
     very important duty of citizenship and without you, the juror, our
                  system of trial by jury would not exist.
