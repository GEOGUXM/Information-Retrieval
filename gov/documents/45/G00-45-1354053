   Most biological macromolecules are designed to perform very precise and
   intricate biochemical functions, and correct communication and
   networking among these molecules is essential for the survival of an
   organism. To achieve such functions, these molecules assume elaborate
   three-dimensional structures. The major thrust of the research effort
   in my laboratory is aimed at understanding the structural bases for (1)
   the molecular communications among proteins, (2) the folding principles
   of proteins and RNA from organisms living under normal and extreme
   conditions, and (3) the evolution and organization of protein folds.
   Our research is divided into five topics:

   I. SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PROTEINS.

   Molecular communication
   in living cells is achieved by the structural complementarity among
   communicating molecules along the communication chains. We study the
   structures of proteins involved in cell growth and cell cycle signal
   transduction pathways, such as receptors (chemotaxis receptors and
   plant hormone receptors), molecular switches (ras proteins and their
   interacting proteins), and signal relays (cell cycle controlling
   protein kinases). We are also interested in discovering and designing
   inhibitors of these proteins based on their structures.


   II. RNA STRUCTURES AND CATALYSIS.

   Recent discoveries that certain RNA molecules have catalytic activities
   hitherto known only to protein enzymes has had a profound impact on our
   understanding of the origin of life and evolution of chemical processes
   in living cells. Our objective is to determine the three-dimensional
   structures of the simplest catalytic RNAs, such as the one derived from
   a plant virus and RNAse P RNA, and to understand the structural basis
   for the mechanism of catalysis in catalytic RNAs and RNA folding.

   III. HYPERTHERMAL ENZYMES

   Many microorganisms live at extreme environments such as hyperthermal
   (over 100 °C) vents and frozen glaciers. The objectives of this program
   are: 1) identification of enzymes capable of catalysis at extremely
   high temperatures; 2) discovery of structural basis for understanding
   unusual stability of proteins, nucleic acids, and membranes at extreme
   temperatures; 3) understanding enzymatic catalysis of unusual chemical
   transformations; and 4) identifying genes and enzymes of utility for
   industrial purposes and/or environmental remediation.

   IV. MEMBRANE PROTEIN STRUCTURES

   Approximately one third of all proteins in a living organism are
   membrane proteins. They are the channels and communicators connecting
   between the outside world and the inside of cells. Yet we know only a
   handfull of their three-dimensional structures. Our objective is to
   determine the three-dimensional structures of several well
   characterized membrane proteins such as signal receptors and
   electron-transfer complexes and understand their biological functions
   from a structural viewpoint.

   V. COMPUTATIONAL GENOMICS

   DNA sequences of entire chromosomes of several procaryotes and one
   eucaryote are known and many more will become known soon. Yet we do not
   know the functions of the majority of these genes. Three-dimensiona
   structures of these gene products may suggest their biochemical
   functions, which can serve as the most fundamental foundation for
   discovering the biological functions, the networking of many
   biochemical functions. Our objective is to learn the principles of
   protein folding, invent new prediction methods for secondary and
   tertiary structures as well as for classifying protein folds, and
   develop computational algorithms to predict molecular interactions
   between proteins or between a protein and its ligand.

   VI. STRUCTURAL GENOMICS

   High throughput sequencing has recently resulted in the determination
   of the complete DNA sequences of several genomes, and the pace is
   increasing. Analysis of the sequences indicates a large fraction of the
   encoded proteins cannot be assigned to particular biochemical functions
   or to participation in particular pathways of biological functions, and
   thus, no assays can be easily devised to investigate their exact roles.
   Since the biochemical function of a gene product is tightly coupled to
   its three-dimensional structure, determining the structure or its
   folding pattern may provide important insight into its biochemical
   function, which, in turn, may help to place it in a particular cellular
   pathway. Thus, the structural study of the proteins encoded by an
   entire genomean approach often called structural genomicsmay be an
   important foundation for the understanding of the biological pathways
   of the whole organism. We are involved in this effort by selecting a
   representative gene from each fold family, and clone, express, and
   determine the three-dimensional structure to discover the biochemical
   function of the gene product.
