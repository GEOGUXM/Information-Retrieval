   What is El Niño?
   ________________________________________

   The term El Niño (Spanish for "the Christ Child") refers to a warm
   ocean current that typically appears around Christmas-time and lasts
   for several months, but may persist into May or June. The warm current
   influences storm patterns around the globe. As a result, these "El
   Niño" climatic events commonly cause bring heavy rains and blustery
   storms, and drought. Basically, the warmth normally seen in the Pacific
   Ocean near the southwest Pacific spreads toward the center of the ocean
   during an El Niño. The warm water carrries with it rain stroms that
   would typically hit Australia and parts of the western Pacific.

   The current El Niño will probably surpass the greatest El Niño of
   century, that of 1982-83. During the past 40 years, nine El Niños have
   affected the western coasts of North and South America. Most of them
   raised water temperatures along 5000 miles of coast. The weaker events
   raised sea temperatures only a few degrees Fahrenheit and caused mild
   changes in weather. But the strong ones, like the El Niño of 1982-83,
   left a climatic imprint that was global in extent.

   El Niño recurs irregularly, from two years to a decade, and no two
   events are exactly alike. Before the 1982-83 El Niño event, scientists
   did not collect detailed information on El Niños, so information is
   scanty for making high-quality predictions about the effects of the
   current El Niño of 1997-98.

   The impacts of El Niños can be devastating, as illustrated by some of
   the effects of the unusually strong El Niño of 1982-83:
     * Drought (sometimes with associated wildfires) in many nations
       (particularly in the western Pacific Rim, southern and northern
       Africa, southern Asia, southern Europe, and parts of South and
       Central America)
     * severe cyclones that damaged island communities in the Pacific
     * flooding over wide areas of South America, western Europe, and the
       Gulf Coastal states
     * severe storms in the western and northeastern United States.

   Effects of the 1982-1983 El Niño

   The 1982-1983 El Niño is the largest well-studied El Niño event, and it
   had dramatic effects on millions of people. In Ecuador and northern
   Peru, up to 100 inches of rain fell, transforming the coastal desert
   into a grassland dotted with lakes. Lush vegetation disrupted
   populations of many animals, from grasshoppers to toads, birds, and
   fish. The disruptions had both beneficial and destructive consequences
   for the people of the region. For example, some flooded coastal
   estuaries set shrimp production records, but also set records for the
   number of mosquito-borne malaria cases.

   In North America, winter storms battered southern California and caused
   widespread flooding across the southern United States, while northern
   ski resort owners complained of unusually mild weather and a lack of
   snow. Inland lakes rose and flooded communities and roads. Landslides
   destroyed homes and killed people. Rivers flooded and destroyed parts
   of cities.

   Overall, the loss to the world economy in 1982-83 as a result of the
   climate changes amounted to over $8 billion. The toll in terms of human
   suffering is much more difficult to estimate.
