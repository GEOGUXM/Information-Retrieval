   Research Interests:

   The protein folding problem is a fundamental question in molecular
   biology. We have initiated studies to examine the pathway of protein
   folding as it occurs in vitro and in vivo.

   Protein folding, in vitro, can occur without the aid of additional
   factors, demonstrating that the amino-acid sequence contains the full
   information required to specify the native conformation. We have been
   examining models systems for studying the structure of possible folding
   intermediates using small-angle scattering, ultraviolet circular
   dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These studies
   may aid in understanding the pathway of protein folding.

   Recent evidence indicates that the in vivo folding process requires
   so-called molecular chaperones. These proteins interact with many
   unfolded or partially unfolded intermediates apparently without
   specific recognition of defined sequence motifs. We are interested in
   characterizing the interactions between molecular chaperones and their
   substrate proteins, as well as the functional complexes formed between
   individual chaperone proteins.

   [ClpP.gif] Three dimensional representations of two ClpP heptameric
   rings. Two of these rings stacked axially (B on top of A) yield the
   complete Clp protease. Sequence conservation in the Clp protease family
   is illustrated by the black colored residues in three subunits. (A)
   provides a view of the lower ring, the ring interface, and the large
   central cavity. (B) is a view of the outer surface along the sevenfold
   axis of the functional 14mer. From: J. Wang, J.A. Hartling and J.M.
