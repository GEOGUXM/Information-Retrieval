     Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are transportation systems
        which utilize information, communication, sensor, and control
    technologies to achieve improved levels of performance. The U.S. DOT
   has developed a National ITS Program Plan for ITS which provides a new
   vision for surface transportation in America. The ITS Program includes
                            seven major elements:

     * Travel & Transportation Management
     * Travel Demand Management
     * Public Transportation Management
     * Electronic Payment
     * Commercial Vehicle Operations (ITS/CVO)
     * Emergency Management
     * Advanced Vehicle Control & Safety Systems

      The ITS/CVO element includes the ITS technologies which uniquely
   support Commercial Vehicle Operations (CVO). The scope of CVO includes
       the operations associated with moving goods and passengers via
     commercial vehicles over the North American highway system and the
       activities necessary to regulate these operations. It includes
   activities related to safety assurance, commercial vehicle credentials
        and tax administration, roadside operations, freight & fleet
                     management, and vehicle operation.

    The term commercial vehicle information systems and networks (CVISN,
    pronounced see vision) refers to the ITS information system elements
   that support CVO. CVISN includes information systems owned and operated
              by governments, carriers, and other stakeholders.
