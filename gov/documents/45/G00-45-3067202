   1. Stardust is the first U.S. mission launched to robotically obtain
   samples in deep space and return them to Earth.

   2. Stardust is the first NASA mission dedicated to exploring a comet.

   3. Comets are leftover materials that formed of the planets and the Sun
   more than 4.5 billion years ago.

   4. Comets contain many of the organic materials thought to be essential
   for the origin of life.

   5. In the early Solar System, comets bombarded the planets, repeatedly
   and often.

   6. The space object that struck Earth 65 million years ago, causing the
   dinosaurs to become extinct, may have been a comet.

   7. Comet Wild 2, the destination of Stardust, almost collided with
   Jupiter in 1974, causing its orbit to be deflected closer to the Sun.

   8. The Stardust spacecraft passes Comet Wild 2 at 13,000 mph (21,000
   kph), over six times faster than a speeding bullet.

   9. At this speed, a Whipple Shield - a stack of five sheets of carbon
   filament and ceramic cloths each spaced 2" apart - can safely protect
   the spacecraft.

   10. It will take several hours to fly through the coma - the cloud of
   dust and gas coming off the comet's nucleus. It will fly through the
   part of the coma ahead of the comet nucleus.

   11. Most particles from a comet are smaller than the diameter of a
   human hair.

   12. Comet particles will be captured using a material called aerogel.

   13. Aerogel is a special type of foamed glass, made so lightweight that
   it is barely visible and almost floats in air.

   14. Comet particles make carrot-shaped tunnels in the aerogel as they
   are stopped. At the pointed tip of each tunnel a tiny particle will be
   found.

   15. Less than one-thousandth of an ounce of cometary dust will be
   collected.

   16. More than 1,000 of the particles collected will be large enough for
   complete scientific analysis, plus millions of smaller particles can be
   analyzed as groups.

   17. Some of the powerful scientific instruments on Earth, used to study
   the cometary material, are more than 100 times larger and heavier than
   the spacecraft itself.

   18. Scientists hope to collect more than 100 particles from a newly
   discovered beam of particles streaming into our Solar System from other
   stars in outer space.

   19. By circling back to swing by Earth to get a gravitational slingshot
   out to the comet, Stardust uses a smaller rocket. This saves over 8
   million dollars.

   20. The spacecraft will travel 2 billion miles to meet Comet Wild 2,
   and another 1 billion miles to get back home.

   21. During its 7 years in space, the Stardust spacecraft races along at
   an average speed of 48,000 mph (78,000 kph).

   22. The return capsule will reenter Earth's atmosphere on Sunday, Jan.
   15, 2006, at 2:45 a.m. Mountain Time and parachute in Utah at the UTTR.

   23. Comets have long amazed people. Since ancient times, myths of their
   origins and their effect on Earth have made us curious about them.

   24. Stardust includes international participation. For example, a
   German instrument will analyze, as they are gathered, volatile ice
   grains and organic materials in comet particles.

   26. During the comet flyby, giant 20-story tall antennas on Earth,
   called the Deep Space Network, will receive transmissions of pictures
   and other scientific data.

   27. In terms of distance from the Sun, Stardust will travel well beyond
   Mars and over half the distance to Jupiter.

   28. At the farthest distance, the solar arrays must generate enough
   electricity to operate the entire spacecraft with only 15% the sunlight
   intensity it has at Earth.

   29. The Stardust capsule hits the Earth's atmosphere at 28,000 mph,
   faster than the Apollo Mission capsules and 70% faster than the reentry
   velocity of the Shuttle.

   30. Stardust must endure five shocking events: launch, flyby,
   atmospheric entry, parachute snap, and touchdown, sustaining loads up
   to 100 times the force due to gravity.

   31. Stardust is the first U.S. mission designed to return samples from
   another body since the Apollo missions to the moon.

   32. The Stardust Outreach program includes premier educational and
   public programs: the Virginia Space Grant Consortium, Space Explorers
   Inc., and the JPL Ambassadors Program.

   33. You can learn all about Stardust, see its pictures and keep up to
