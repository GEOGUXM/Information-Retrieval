   Public Safety

   Overview

   The Public Safety Vision...
   Transportation, fire, law enforcement, and emergency medical services
   agencies and staff will share accurate, correct, relevant, and timely
   information with each other for fast, efficient, and safe incident
   resolution. To perform at their best, transportation and public safety
   professionals need accurate, correct, relevant, and timely information.
   Similarly, public safety agencies are deploying advanced data systems
   that can use ITS resources.

   Interoperable procedures and technologies for public safety and
   transportation operations will enable this vision of integrated
   information for safer communities.
