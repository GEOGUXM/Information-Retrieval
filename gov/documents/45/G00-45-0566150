   To run MediaReports applets your browser must use a Java Virtual
   Machine. You may use the browser's default Java Virtual Machine or a
   Java Plug-in. If you do not already have the plug-in installed, you
   will be automatically directed to the Java Plug-in download page the
   first time you choose YES below. Once you have the plug-in installed
   clicking YES will simply open MediaReports.

   We highly recommend the Java Plug-in for simplicity and speed. If you
   choose not to use the Java Plug-in please follow these steps to
   configure your browser.
