   INSTALLING A NEW CD
   On the subject of CD’s, many people ask, "I received the latest CD,
   what now?" First you should read the information that comes with the
   CD. There may be some important release notes or special installation
   instructions. If this is the first time that you are installing Eagle
   Point, you will want to look over the Getting Started manual. Eagle
   Point Corp. have done their best to make it clear and concise. Nearly
   50% of my support calls are generated from questions about setup and
   installation. Many of these questions could be answered by taking a few
   minutes to plan out how you intend to get the software from the CD to
   your computer(s).

   *TIME RUNS OUT ON RELEASE 14

   January 15 was the last day you'll were able to upgrade AutoCAD Release
   14 and Release 14-based products. AutoDesk will discontinue technical
   support for Release 14 on January 31. The Release 14 discussion group
   will continue for another year and technical documents will remain
   available at the AutoDesk Web site for an "indefinite period of time."

   CRAB’s Eagle Point Training Advantages:
   • Learning curve is sharply decreased so you become more productive to
   your County organization.
   • Each student has their own computer
   • Instructor is a licensed engineer as well as having more than 13
   years of professional experience.
   • Working relationship with the people that designed the software
   In addition to step-by-step instruction using practical design
   solutions, users learn timesaving shortcuts. Each student also receives
   a comprehensive training manual and data files that can be taken back

   fresh. The only cost to you is if you don't attend!

                        Eagle Point Completes Merger

   Eagle Point Completes Merger, Refocuses Itself for Continued Success
   As mentioned by Jim Pullen at our 2001 Road Design Conference, Eagle
   Point Software Corporation has announced the completion of its
   previously announced merger with an entity formed by John F. Biver, a
   founder and director of Eagle Point and former Vice President of the
   Company’s Civil Applications Division. Biver sees Eagle Point’s
   direction as focusing 100% on the land development automation industry,
   Eagle Point's core market since its inception in 1983.

   Prior to the merger, Eagle Point also developed applications for the
   residential building design and construction, architectural, and
   structural engineering markets. Those divisions of Eagle Point have
   been divested to another company.

   As Mr. Biver states, "The truly exciting opportunity for Eagle Point is
   that we can now become even more client-centric than we have been in
   the past," Biver added. "By focusing on our clients' needs instead of
   the short-term results demanded by public investors, we can take a more
   long-term view toward our business direction. In the past, we at times
   may have made decisions that didn't help our clients long-term, but
   instead gave us better short-term results to report to stockholders.
   This will no longer occur."

   We here at CRAB are very excited about this merger. With the original
   founder now back in control, we feel this will only strengthen our
   alliance with the company that we first made our initial investment in.
   Their refocusing of the company's business model back to the land
   development industry will allow them to once again develop leading
   software applications along with effective implementation of the
   software which in turn will help you, as county transportation
   professionals, fully leverage the benefits offered by the ever changing
   technology.

                          2002 RDC LOCATION RESULTS

                     2002 Road Design Conference Update

   Well the votes have been tallied and the tribe has spoken, it has been
   decided by the majority of you to go to the Tri-Cities for the 2002
   RDC, Road Design Conference, coming up this fall. This will be the 13th
   annual Design Systems Conference that the CRAB design system’s group
   will be presenting to the counties of Washington State.

   We are currently busy considering all of your responses from last
   year's evaluations letters and are very excited about this year’s
   agenda possibilities. Here are the some of suggestions for next year’s
   conference agenda that we will be working on and discussing at a
   pre-conference meeting:
   Potential Conference Agenda Topic’s

   Consultant Challenges – Invite representatives from the private sector
   with experience dealing with the counties or state to give their
   perspective on design challenges working with government contracts that
   require a certain data format.
   Legal issues concerning contract specifications, change orders, etc…
   Fish Passage Design per the Dept. of Fisheries requirements.
   Presentations by regulator’s such as the Corps, DOE, Fisheries to
   explain what they really want.
   Roundabout Designs
   Pavement Design – new materials or processes
   Geotextiles
   Non-Motorized Transportation designs – bike paths, trails to rails…
   New Stormwater Manual changes per the DOE
   Stormwater Design Tools – How to integrate all the different software
   tools to end up with a design, which will satisfy all the mandated
   requirements, oversight and cost considerations.
   (The following suggestions were submitted from Phyllis Kanyer, Kitsap
   County Public Works)
   Intersection Design Challenge.
   Regarding the request made on the last day of the 20001 RDC, have an
   intersection design challenge. Have a common task and common raw data
   with which to work. It would be up to the chosen counties to use their
   own medium and use their own current standards to accomplish the task.
   The format at the conference would be to have each county step us
   through their method (either a slide show or live) and have on hand the
   hours needed to accomplish the task. They would also have to have
   either hardcopy prints or electronic slides of the final
   construction-ready project. The task is not to have a trick
   intersection with major problems, but a fairly routine task that would
   not exceed a certain amount of hours to complete. It would be great to
   have at least one representation from each of the engineering software
   packages being used by the counties. Benson Burleson, Engineer 1 Kitsap
   County Public Works, further suggests to have the data delivered as a
   LANDXML file. This would be a double check on all the software products
   to see if they can handle this new sharing method.
   Have more county involvement in the breakout sessions. Send a list of
   possible topics to all counties for volunteers to make workshop
   presentations. We came up with a list that last day but they could be
   some of the following: Data Collection/Survey, Staking information for
   Construction, Drafting (CAD) standards, Stream enhancement, Culvert
   Replacement (fish friendly or not), Methods of archiving projects and
   Creative pavement projects.
   More hands-on workshops/computer labs. Last year was our first attempt
   to set up PC’s at the RDC to be used for computer based training
   workshops. Although very rough in it’s introduction stage, it did lead
   to great discussions and showed the value added potential that this
   type of workshop can provide to the conference attendees with an
   experience to come away from the conference with that otherwise would
   not be possible. We can either do like we did last year and have each
   software vendor provide brief training sessions for each attendee or
   just have a few computers setup for the company’s to display their
   software’s bells and whistles and have them running with a CBT
   utilizing the new features.

   And as always, we plan to have returning the familiar software
   companies such as Eagle Point, AutoDesk, CAiCE, and others will be
   there to present to us an update on the latest and greatest
   enhancements to their products with a request to have less of sales
   pitch make more of a point to just us the enhancements to their
   products.

   Come join us for a pre-conference meeting! Now that you told us what
   you want to see we would like to schedule a pre-conference meeting in
   March or April (depending on what works for the majority) at the Summit
   Inn at Snoqualmie Summit, to discuss these suggestions in further
   detail and perhaps add more if time permits.  If interested in
   attending, please email Cheryl at cheryl@crab.wa.gov  with your
   confirmation and possible dates that work for you.
   We've been listening to you...and this is gonna be another good one.

                       AutoCAD Tips, Tricks and Links

   AUTOCAD TIP: MESSAGE IN A DRAWING
   Hot Tip Harry's bonus tip for December 2001 lets you save notes with an
   AutoCAD drawing, together with who saved the message and the date and
   time it was saved.
   http://www.cadalyst.com/code/browseyear.cfm?fullyear=2001#12

   Another way to attach notes to a drawing is to use the Hyperlink
   command. Grip the feature in your drawing, for instance a culvert then
   click on the hyperlink command. Don't bother linking to anything-just
   add your note in the Hyperlink Description box. It will appear whenever
   the cursor moves over the item to which it's attached.

                   Washington State DOE Stormwater Update

   Stormwater Manual Workshops

   This past fall the Department of Ecology (Ecology) released its
   Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington. The manual has
   been updated to contain new information and technical standards, and to
   expand the applicability beyond Puget Sound to all of western
   Washington. This updated manual replaces the document initially
   developed and published by Ecology in 1992.
   The workshops are geared for those responsible for implementing the
   provisions of the Stormwater Manual. This includes local and state
   officials responsible for permitting, planning, and/or design related
   to stormwater requirements. Developers, commercial and industrial
   companies, and consulting engineers involved in stormwater management
   requirements in western Washington may also want to attend the
   workshops. For more information click here Stormwater Workshop

                             "LINK OF THE WEEK"

   LONGEST CABLE STAYED BRIDGE IN THE UNITED STATES The construction of a
   bridge across the Mississippi River is a grand spectacle, the kind of
   event that may come to a city or region only once in a lifetime. The
   people of Greenville, Mississippi, and Lake Village, Arkansas,
   celebrated such an event on September 17, 1940, when more than 5,000
   people gathered to dedicate the new US 82 Benjamin G. Humphreys bridge,
   one of the longest spans anywhere on the river when it was finished. In
   2006, such a celebration will occur again when the newest US 82 bridge
   opens, and the dream of a bridge for Greenville comes true for the
   second time in a century. For more information go to:
