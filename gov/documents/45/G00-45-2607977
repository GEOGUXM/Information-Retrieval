     for you. We can help you find the care you need."

   Self Directed Care

     "However, what if a functional disability prevents an adult from
     physically performing a health-care function that he or she would
     normally do? An adult with a disability can now choose to direct and
     supervise a paid personal aide" or Individual Provider (IP) to
     perform such tasks
