    General Information
        ____________________________________________________________

   Education Law ยง310 provides that any person considering himself
   aggrieved by an action taken at a school district meeting or by school
   authorities may appeal to the Commissioner of Education for a review of
   such action. A ยง310 appeal must be initiated within 30 days of the
   decision or action complained of, unless the delay is excused by the
   Commissioner for good cause shown in the petition.

   In addition, Education Law ยง306 allows the Commissioner of Education to
   remove a trustee, member of a board of education and certain other
   school officers for wilful misconduct or neglect of duty. An
   application for removal must also be initiated within 30 days of the
   decision or action complained of, and must contain evidence of wilful,
   intentional wrongdoing.

   The burden of proof in an appeal to the Commissioner rests with the
   person bringing the petition, i.e. the petitioner. The petitioner has
   the burden of demonstrating a clear legal right to the relief requested
   and the burden of establishing all the facts upon which he seeks
   relief. This may be accomplished by the submission of affidavits,
   exhibits or other proof. Mere allegations, suppositions, theories or
   conclusions, without factual proof are insufficient.

   The Commissioner of Education has promulgated regulations governing the
   practice to be followed in such appeals. These regulations are found in
   Parts 275, 276 and 277 of the Commissioner's Regulations and are
   available on this web site.

   In addition, the Office of Counsel has prepared general instructions, a
   series of questions and answers, and sample forms for filing an appeal
   for petitioners not represented by an attorney. These items are
   available on this web site. Please note that the instructions and forms
   are only intended to serve as a guide. Petitioners are encouraged to
   consult with their own attorney before initiating an appeal to the
   Commissioner of Education.

   The decisions of the Commissioner of Education are officially reported
   and indexed in Education Department Reports (currently 39 volumes).
   Unedited and unindexed decisions from July 1991 are available on this
   web site. Prior to bringing an appeal, petitioners are encouraged to
   review decisions with facts similar to their case. These decisions
   establish precedent by which future cases will be decided.
