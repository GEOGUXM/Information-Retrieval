New Section of ABAG Site Focuses on Tips to Deal with Traffic After Earthquakes
and Other Disasters

   [Cartoon-Car_150.gif]

   September 20, 2001 - It is easy to feel hopeless and overwhelmed by
   recent events and to feel that we are at the mercy of the unexpected.
   One way to cope with feelings of hopelessness is to empower oneself and
   take concrete action to become better prepared to handle the aftermath
   of disasters like future earthquakes and man-made tragedies.

   Traffic disruption similar to that following the attack on the World
   Trade Center is one particular ramification that we can expect to see
   and have seen in disasters like earthquakes and fires. ABAG, in
   conjunction with State of California Office of Traffic Safety through
   the Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, has been working on
   mitigating transportation issues during and after a disaster. As a
   result, ABAG has issued new preparedness tips for "riding out" these
   disasters. This disaster-preparedness information, directed towards
   parents, businesses, and the public in general, is found in a new
   Traffic section of the ABAG web site.

   Why do we need to plan out how to get around during a disaster?

   In addition to giving us the opportunity to take some control over our
   safety, it makes good sense to prepare for and think ahead to what each
   of us would need to do if a disaster struck, and we are in our cars or
   away from home. Thoughtful preparation and pre-planning will make us
   safer drivers and give us the necessary plan to help weather the
   unexpected.

   The ABAG Transportation Disaster project focuses on having a personal
   disaster plan that includes such basic, but necessary, steps as
   pre-designating emergency contacts who are authorized to pick up your
   children at school when you can't reach them. Available on the ABAG
   website are thorough disaster preparedness checklists outlining
   specific preparedness steps we need to consider. These checklists
   address the pre-planning and preparation that public and private
   businesses should implement, as well as the issues individuals as
   employees, residents and family members should pre-plan and put in
   place.

   One thing that everyone can do is plan ahead. We cannot always prevent
   a disaster, but we can determine better ways to minimize its impact.
   Implementing a disaster preparedness checklist is one way to take
   control and make a difference.

ABAG Staff Travel to Turkey for First-Hand Information on 1999 Quakes

                  Earthquake.

   Business was booming. Starting in 1970, the Kocaeli area, just east of
   Istanbul, grew to become the second largest industrial center in
   Turkey, accounting for 13% of the country's industrial output. Kocaeli
   has an educated work force, a central location, and a spectacular
   location surrounding the Sea of Marmara (roughly the size of San
   Francisco Bay). Extensive apartment blocks were constructed during the
   past 30 years to house an exploding population that relocated to serve
   the rapidly expanding economy. The business community, elected
   officials, and Chamber of Commerce and Industry are proud of recent
   awards for promoting "green" industry.

   On August 17, 1999, roughly 10 years after our Loma Prieta earthquake,
   disaster struck. Over 75 miles of the North Anatolian fault ruptured,
   generating a magnitude 7.4 earthquake and 45 seconds of violent ground
   shaking at 3:02 a.m. In comparison, the magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta
   earthquake in 1989 ruptured a fault 25 miles long, with approximately
   20 seconds of violent shaking. Those 45 seconds of terror resulted in
   17,480 deaths, largely in relatively new apartments, and 133,000
   uninhabitable housing units (versus 62 deaths and 16,000 uninhabitable
   housing units after the Loma Prieta earthquake). The central and
   municipal governments in Turkey became overwhelmed. Kizilay (the
   Turkish Red Crescent/Red Cross) struggled to meet the basic feeding
   needs of the displaced, having only planned for a disaster one-fifth as
   large.

   Jeanne Perkins, ABAG's Earthquake Program manager, was part of a
   three-person team of researchers who visited Turkey in early June to
   collect data on housing damage, sheltering, feeding, and medical
   services provided following this earthquake. The visit was funded by
   the National Science Foundation. She plans to use the data collected in
   future projects to test and improve ABAG's models of shaking and
   liquefaction hazards. Dr. Jack Harrald from George Washington
   University, another member of the team, hopes to use these data to
   better predict shelter and feeding demand. His work forms the basis for
   both ABAG's and the Bay Area Red Cross's forecasts of disaster
   sheltering in the region. The compilation and assessment of data
   inconsistencies is being coordinated by Irmak Renda-Tenali, also of
   George Washington University, who, as a Turkish citizen, was the
   invaluable third member of the team. Data collected during the trip
   will be posted on ABAG's earthquake program web site in the fall.

   "I am already amazed by how much we have learned from this visit,"
   Perkins stated. "Local municipalities were on the front end of
   responding to this disaster. They were excited about sharing many
   lessons that they viewed as useful with cities and counties here in the
   Bay Area, both in areas related to housing damage, but also related to
   service delivery." For example, debris was pushed into the Sea of
   Marmara for two days until those responsible were stopped and fined.
   The remaining debris (about 90 - 95% of the total) was crushed and
   recycled using both local and international equipment.

   Lifeline performance was quite good in the Izmit area, the largest
   heavily impacted city. The modern wastewater system was undamaged,
   while the water supply system in that area was fully functional 8 hours
   after the quake, even though over half of the deaths occurred in this
   city. Telephone communications were fully functional in 8 hours, while
   natural gas service was restored in 72 hours.

   Although few roads were closed, traffic attempting to enter the
   impacted area disrupted search and rescue, as well as emergency
   response activities. In a later earthquake on November 12, 1999, the
   provincial governor ordered the closure of all roads into the area
   except for emergency vehicles. The governor viewed the need for rapid
   traffic control as one of the principal lessons from the Kocaeli quake.
   ABAG's Earthquake Program is currently working on a public information
   campaign for earthquake traffic information funded by a grant from the
   California Office of Traffic Safety through the Business,
   Transportation and Housing Agency.

   ABAG released its new report, "The REAL Dirt on Liquefaction" at a
   Mini-Conference on February 7, 2001. The report and maps related to how
   liquefaction will affect the Bay Area in future earthquakes.

Don't Wing It - Airports and Bay Area Airports

   [dontwingit.gif]

   ABAG has released a new report on airports and Bay Area earthquakes on
   Thursday, December 28th. The new report, Don't Wing It!, features
   answers to important issues. (1) How vulnerable are airports? (2) What
   will we need from airports for emergency response and economic
   recovery? (3) Is there a role for other airports? The report includes
   recommendations from a workshop held on October 10, 2000.

   The full report can be purchased OnLine.
