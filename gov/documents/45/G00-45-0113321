   The 14,500 employees of the Indian Health Service provide health care
   to more than 1.3 million American Indians and Alaska Natives in 35
   states. To manage such a complex health care delivery system, the IHS
   is divided into 12 geographic regions, called "Areas." Each Area Office
   provides administrative support to the hospitals, clinics and other
   facilities and personnel within its region. The Areas are further
   subdivided into Service Units, comprised of a hospital and perhaps
   several satellite clinics and field health stations. The 12 IHS Areas
   are depicted by color on the map below. The dots on this map indicate
   the location of IHS facilities, many of which provide employment
   opportunities for dentists. For a closer look, click on any Area on the
   map.
