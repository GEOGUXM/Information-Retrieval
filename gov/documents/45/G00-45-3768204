   Early Argonne reactor lit the way for worldwide nuclear industry


      These four light bulbs sprang to life Dec. 20, 1951, when EBR-1
      produced the world's first usable amount of atomic electricity.

   FIRST ATOMIC LIGHT -- On Dec. 20, 1951, Experimental Breeder Reactor 1
    (EBR-I) lighted these four bulbs with the world's first usable amount
      of electricity from nuclear energy. Designed, built and operated by
   Argonne National Laboratory, EBR-I was the first reactor built on what
           is now called the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental
                                                              Laboratory.

      ARGONNE, Ill. (Dec. 20, 2001) - Fifty years ago today, a nuclear
      reactor produced useful electricity for the first time.

      It was more than enough to power a simple string of four light bulbs.
      Recognizing their historic achievement, the 16 scientists and engineers
      of Argonne National Laboratory recorded their names in chalk on the
      wall beside the generator.

      The reactor was Experimental Breeder Reactor 1 (EBR-I), housed in a
      small building that today still sits alone on a wind-swept plain in
      southeastern Idaho. EBR-1 was designed and operated by Argonne and
      built by Bechtel Group, Inc. The reactor spawned a huge international
      industry that now plays a major role in meeting the world's energy
      needs.

      Today, more than 100 nuclear power plants provide 20 percent of the
      electricity consumed in the United States. More than 435 reactors
      provide some 17 percent of the world's electricity, and dozens of more
      plants are under construction around the world.

      During its 15-year career, EBR-1 was the site of many historical
      firsts, and retired Argonne scientist Kirby Whitham was an integral
      part of several of them.

      On that raw December day in 1951, scientists and technicians readied
      for the first test of the power-generating system. "We got the reactor
      critical, which was a rather slow process," Whitham said. "Generating
      steam for the first time was a problem, because we hadn't done it
      before. Technicians were running everywhere, measuring temperatures and
      so on.

      "It took quite a while to get the turbine up to speed, then we had to
      load the generator. The generator put out 440 volts, so we used four
      light bulbs wired in series."

      When the bulbs lit up, "we didn't clap our hands or anything," Whitham
      said. "We were just glad it worked."

      Walter Zinn, the first director of Argonne National Laboratory, brought
      out a bottle of champagne to celebrate the achievement. "Everyone had a
      cup," Whitham said, "but there was lots of work to do - checking oil
      pressures and other things we weren't used to doing."

      The day after EBR-1 generated the world's first nuclear electricity,
      its output was boosted to 100 kilowatts, enough to power all of its own
      electrical equipment. This process didn't go as smoothly as the
      previous day's activities; the generator had to be manually
      synchronized with the outside power line, Whitham said, which required
      a deft touch with a knob while watching a meter spin.

      "On the first try, heaven and earth came together. We blew all the
      fuses," he said with a chuckle.

      After that, except for normal shutdown to perform maintenance or to
      attend to experiments, EBR-I provided all its own electricity
      throughout its operating career.

      EBR-I's primary experimental mission was to develop and test the
      concept of the breeder reactor - a vision pursued by Enrico Fermi and
      his colleague, Zinn, who led the team that built EBR-I. The idea behind
      the breeder is to maximize the useful energy that can be extracted from
      natural uranium.

      Inside a nuclear reactor, uranium-238 - the common form of the metal
      which cannot be used for fuel - can capture neutrons released during
      fission and transform into plutonium-239. This man-made element can
      fuel reactors, so breeding makes it possible to use virtually 100
      percent of the energy in natural uranium.

      EBR-I provided the first proof that breeding is possible: On June 4,
      1953, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission announced that EBR-I had become
      the world's first reactor to demonstrate the breeding of plutonium from
      uranium.

      In 1962, EBR-I became the world's first reactor to produce electricity
      with a plutonium core. For the next year, the reactor provided valuable
      data on breeding in a plutonium-fueled reactor and helped to improve
      scientists' understanding of the behavior of plutonium in an operating
      reactor.

      On Dec. 30, 1963, its scientific mission complete, EBR-I was officially
      shut down. On Aug. 26, 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson presided over
      ceremonies that designated the retired reactor a Registered Historical
      National Monument. Before 15,000 witnesses, he said, "We have come to a
      place today where hope was born that man would do more with his
      discovery [of atomic fission] than unleash destruction in its wake."

      The nationÂ’s first national laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory
      conducts basic and applied scientific research across a wide spectrum
      of disciplines, ranging from high-energy physics to climatology and
      biotechnology. Since 1990, Argonne has worked with more than 600
      companies and numerous federal agencies and other organizations to help
      advance America's scientific leadership and prepare the nation for the
      future. Argonne is operated by the University of Chicago as part of the
      U.S. Department of Energy's national laboratory system.
