   Welcome to Electronic Case Filing 101

   The Electronic Case Filing (ECF) Tutorial is designed for attorneys
   interested in learning how to use the CM/ECF system. Through guided
   practice, using simulated CM/ECF screens and actions, you will learn
   how to file pleadings and other materials using the CM/ECF system.

   The tutorial consists of six modules. The first five modules guide you
   through specific CM/ECF functions such as how to file a motion or how
   to create a docket report. The sixth module contains a link to an Adobe
   Acrobat tutorial on working with PDF documents.

   If you are a new CM/ECF user, you should begin with Module 1 and
   continue to the end of Module 6. At any point in the tutorial, you can
   bookmark your place and return when and where it is convenient to you.
