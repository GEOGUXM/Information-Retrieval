   Earth's 4.5-billion-year history is a study in change. Natural
   geological forces have been rearranging the surface features and
   climatic conditions of our planet since its beginning. Today, there is
   compelling scientific evidence that human activities have attained the
   magnitude of a geological force and are speeding up the rates of global
   changes. For example, carbon dioxide levels have risen 25 percent since
   the industrial revolution and about 40 percent of the world's land
   surface has been transformed by humans. (Terra's five main science
   objectives are discussed in detail in the fact sheets listed in the
   righthand column of this page.)

   Scientists don't understand the cause-and-effect relationships among
   Earth's lands, oceans, and atmosphere well enough to predict what, if
   any, impacts these rapid changes will have on future climate
   conditions. Scientists need to make many measurements all over the
   world, over a long period of time, in order to assemble the information
   needed to construct accurate computer models that will enable them to
   forecast the causes and effects of climate change. The only feasible
   way to collect this information is through the use of space-based Earth
   "remote sensors" (instruments that can measure things like temperature
   from a distance). Consequently, NASA's Earth Observing System has begun
   an international study of planet Earth that is comprised of three main
   components: 1) a series of satellites specially designed to study the
   complexities of global change; 2) an advanced computer network for
   processing, storing, and distributing data (called EOSDIS); and 3)
   teams of scientists all over the world who will study the data.

   On February 24, 2000, Terra began collecting what will ultimately
   become a new, 15-year global data set on which to base scientific
   investigations about our complex home planet. There are three other EOS
   satellites currently in orbit and fifteen more will follow over the
   next four years. Together, these spacecraft will help scientists
   unravel the mysteries of climate and environmental change. If you want
   to learn more about these missions, visit the EOS Missions Page. If you
   want to learn about new EOS science results, visit the Earth
   Observatory. If you want to learn more about how the Terra spacecraft
   was designed, built, and tested, visit the Terra Project web page.
