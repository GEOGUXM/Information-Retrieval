                              see caption below
    IC 418. It is believed this was once like our sun transitioning into a
                                                          white dwarf star

   Since the earliest days, humans have been fascinated (and sometimes
   frightened) by the sky. Modern science helps us understand the
   tremendous forces that are at work in the daytime and nighttime skies.
   Since we don't spend as much time looking up as our ancestors did much
   of the fascination is gone. But to those who enjoy the show that the
   skies present, Science @ NASA brings the heavens down to Earth. Stories
   about the sun, moon, planets, auroras, meteors and other features of
   the sky will help you understand and enjoy the show!
