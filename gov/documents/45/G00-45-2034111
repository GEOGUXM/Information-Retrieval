   At the run II steering, Rene Brun presented the current status of ROOT.
   He went over the newest improvements in ROOT 2/23. This includes a
   much greater modularization, the addition of a set of SQL abstract
   classes
   and performance improvement when reading file back.
   He also stressed that the current focus for the next release is to work
   on consolidation of current features. However he also hoped that he
   will
   be able toimprove the current ROOT file format to be self describing by
   the next release (tentatively due in February/March); this feature is
   necessary
   for DZero to consider using ROOT files. Also he hopes to be able to
   improve
   the TTree class to meet the need of CDF Online.
