   PEAKERS BULLETIN BOARD

   This electronic Bulletin Board was originally set up to allow people to
   exchange information about the peakers and for companies to contact
   others about equipment or other expertise available. We urge people to
   use this Bulletin Board system to post messages, questions and answers.
   The board was discontinued in January 2002.

   California Emergency Siting
   Peaker Power Plant Permitting

   NEW PEAKING POWER PLANTS
   Less than 300 MW

   Governor Gray Davis has identified a goal of bringing 1,000 megawatts
   of new power plants to meet the electricity needs during peak demand
   periods. Typically these are simple-cycle power plants that can be
   constructed in a relatively small area, do not require water supplies
   for cooling, and can readily be connected to the existing transmission
   and natural gas system.

   The Governor directed the Energy Commission to use its emergency power
   plant permitting authority under Public Resources Code 25705 to permit
   new peaking and renewable power plants that can be online by September
   30, 2001. Emergency power plant projects permitted under this process
   are exempt from requirements of the California Environmental Quality
   Act.
