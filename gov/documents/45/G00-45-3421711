                       Dreier Statement on President Bush's
                            State of the Union Address

        WASHINGTON - Congressman David Dreier (R-CA), Chairman of the House
        Rules Committee, made the following statement tonight in reaction to
        the Presidents State of the Union address:

        President Bush gave a powerful and focused speech tonight, reminding
        Americans that despite the tremendous losses weve suffered, the
        state of our union is stronger than ever. As our men and women fight
        terrorism both abroad and here at home, we have a renewed pride and
        a renewed commitment to freedom across the globe.

        The three goals outlined by the President - winning the war on
        terror, securing the homeland, and creating jobs - are the three
        most important fights we will wage in the months and years ahead. A
        robust economy will be key to fighting global terrorism and
        preventing another attack. As the President said, the threat is out
        there. We must remain vigilant and stay prepared.

        The President laid out a clear and determined strategy to defend
        America here at home and abroad and to create economic growth. In
        the year ahead, Congress must put politics aside and work together
        for the benefit of the American people. These extraordinary times
        demand nothing less. With the leadership and vision President Bush
        displayed tonight, I feel confident well do what is right for
        America.
