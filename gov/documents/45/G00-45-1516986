   September, 2001- New Item!

   A technology forum was held at Glenn on September 5 and 6, 2001 to
   report on technology progress of the Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology
   Program. Fifty technical presentations were given by NASA, Industry,
   and University researchers in six project sessions. The 241
   participants represented 31 companies, 5 federal agencies, and 9
   universities.

   UEET Staff Attends the Oskosh Airshow
   The Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology Program will be represented at
   the Oskkosh Airshow in Oshkosh, WI. A variety of displays which show
   the progess of new revolutionary technology for engines and aircraft
   will be displayed. The NASA Glenn particpation will concentrate on the
   progress that is being made for a quieter and faster engine. The new
   KidsVentures will also be supported by the UEET staff. See pictures
   from KidVenture - The Model of the Wright Flyer and a picture of the
   President of EAA and Mr. Donald J. Campbell Center Director of the
   Glenn Research Center signing an education agreement.

   May, 2001

   NASA's Turning Goals Into Reality Conference
   The Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology Program will be participating in
   NASA's Turning Goals Into Reality Conference, sponsored by the Office
   of Aerospace Technology, May 15-17, 2001 in Washington, DC. The Glenn
   Research Center will be accepting an award at the conference for UEET
   technology that has shown, at a low technology development level in
   flametube tests, up to an 83% reduction in the production of Nitrogen
   Oxides (NOx) from the 1996 International Civil Aviation Organization's
   NOx regulations. This technology will enable future low NOx emitting
   aircraft engines, thereby improving local air quality around airports.

Topics of Interest

   A regular part of the Status/News Page will be the inclusion of the
   most recent developments in the UEET program. The Topics of Interest
   (TOI) will share a brief overview of a technology issue or a
   significant item of information about the program. The most recent ones
   will be on this page. To find the complete list of Topics of Interest
