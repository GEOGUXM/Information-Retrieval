                        The new home for NOAA-Boulder

   The building is now finished and NOAA has completed the move. The photo
   above was taken in March, 1999 after the construction was complete.

   The computer generated image that used to be shown above, made from the
   architectural drawings back in 1996, is still available in both a low
   resolution, and a sharpened image (260K) form. Check out this combined
   image to directly see how well the computer generated image compares
   with the actual construction photo.

   On October 18, 1996, a groundbreaking ceremony was held to mark the
   beginning of the construction process for the new NOAA science and
   research facility in Boulder being constructed by the General Services
   Administration (GSA). The new building will house several NOAA entities
   including six Environmental Research Laboratories (ERL), the National
   Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), the local office of the National
   Weather Service (NWS), and the Mountain Administrative Support Center
   (MASC).

Location of the Building Site

   The new building will be located on the Department of Commerce (DOC)
   campus at 325 Broadway in Boulder, Colorado. The site is shared by the
   DOC organizations of the National Institute of Standards and Technology
   (NIST), the National Telecommunications and Information Administration
   (NTIA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Organizations (NOAA).
     * The City of Boulder Open Space Management Program provided NOAA
       with some digital maps of the Dept. of Commerce (DOC) Campus area.
       NOAA has updated these maps to show various details of the campus
       surrounding this new construction.
          + City view.
          + Area surrounding DOC Campus.
          + Close-up of DOC Campus.
     * Pre-construction aerial view of site (224KB).
     * Aerial views of the site taken by Richard Fritz of NOAA/ETL:
