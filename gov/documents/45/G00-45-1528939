        __________________________________________________________________

                      Welcome to the On-line Reports Site for
               Maricopa County Department of Environmental Services

      Our department has made a commitment to extend our network and provide
      local, state and federal agencies as well as private persons and
      business enterprises convenient access to our information. The
      department’s migration towards automation and the electronic storage of
      data has progressed to a point where we can expand Internet services
      and extend our client/server applications onto the public Internet.
      This Web Site provides a direct connection from web browsers to an
      interactive application to support on-line inquires into department
      data. The Web Server, Microsoft’s Internet Information Server (IIS),
      runs on a Windows NT platform. This dedicated machine houses a
      customized application developed using PowerBuilder and a Data
      Warehouse updated weekly with department information.
