     Chronic, hardcore drug use is a disease, and anyone suffering from a
     disease needs treatment. But many addicts also are criminals who
     infringe on or violate the rights of others. In these instances, a
     balance should be created between sanctions for criminal activity
     and treatment of an addictive disease. There is compelling evidence
     to support the fact that treatment is cost-effective and provides
     significant public safety benefits by breaking the cycle of drug use
     and crime. However, criminal acts must be punished, and tough
     sanctions often are needed to force drug-addicted criminals to stop
     using drugs and committing crimes. The National Drug Control
     Strategy calls for drug treatment and tough, punitive sanctions to
     be used in a coordinated fashion to improve public safety and to
     give chronic, hardcore drug users a chance to recover from
     addiction.
