             The 11-day mission will feature the second flight of the Wake
             Shield Facility (WSF), a saucer-shaped satellite that will fly
             free of the Shuttle for several days. The WSF will grow thin
             films in a near perfect vacuum created by the wake of the
             satellite as it it moves through space. The crew also will
             deploy and retrieve the Spartan 201 astronomy satellite, perform
             a six-hour spacewalk to test assembly techniques for the
             international Space Station and test thermal improvements made
             to space suits used during space walks.

             The Spartan 201 free-flyer will be making its third flight
             aboard the Shuttle. The Spartan 201 mission is a scientific
             research effort aimed at the investigation of the interaction
             between the Sun and its outflowing wind of charged particles.
             Spartan's goal is to study the outer atmosphere of the Sun and
             its transition into the solar wind that constantly flows past
             the Earth.

             STS-69 will see the first flight of the International Extreme
             Ultraviolet Hitchhiker (IEH-1), the first of five planned
             flights to measure and monitor long-term variations in the
             magnitude of absolute extreme ultraviolet (EUV) flux coming from
             the Sun, and to study EUV emissions from the plasma torus system
             around Jupiter originating from its moon Io.

             Also flying aboard Endeavour will be the combined Capillary
             Pumped Loop-2/Gas Bridge Assembly (CAPL-2/GBA) payload. This
             experiment consists of the CAPL-2 Hitchhiker payload designed as
             an in-orbit microgravity demonstration of a cooling system
             planned for the Earth Observing System Program and the Thermal
             Energy Storage-2 payload, part of an effort to develop advanced
             energy generation techniques. Also a part of this payload are
             several Get Away Special (GAS) experiments which will
             investigate areas such as the interaction of spacecraft attitude
             and orbit control systems with spacecraft structures,
             fluid-filled beams as structural dampers in space and the
             effects of smoldering combustion in a long-term microgravity
             environment.

             Another payload being flown with a connection to the development
             of the Space Station is the Electrolysis Performance Improvement
             Concept Study (EPICS). Supply of oxygen and hydrogen by
             electrolyzing water in space will play an important role in
             meeting NASA's needs and goals for future space missions.
             On-board generation of oxygen is expected to reduce the annual
             resupply requirement for the Space Station by approximately
             12,000 pounds.

             Other payloads aboard are the National Institutes of Health-
             Cells-4 (NIH-C4) experiment that investigates bone loss during
             space flight; the Biological Research in Canister-6 (BRIC-6)
             that studies the gravity-sensing mechanism within mammalian
             cells. Also flying are two commercial experiments. (CMIX-4)
             whose objectives include analysis of cell change in microgravity
             along with studies of neuro-muscular development disorders and
             the Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus-7 (CGBA-7). CGBA
             is a secondary payload that serves as an incubator and data
             collection point for experiments in pharmaceuticals testing and
             biomedicine, bioprocessing and biotechnology, agriculture and
             the environment.

             The Thermal Energy Storage (TES-2) experiment also is part of
             the CAPL-2/GBA-6. The TES-2 payload is designed to provide data
             for understanding the long-duration behavior of thermal energy
             storage fluoride salts that undergo repeated melting and
             freezing in microgravity. The TES-2 payload is designed to study
             the microgravity behavior of voids in Lithium Fluoride-Calcium
             Fluoride eutectic, a thermal energy storage salt. Data from this
             experiment will validate a computer code called TESSIM, useful
             for the analysis of heat receivers in advanced solar dynamic
             power system designs.

   Launch:

             Thursday, September 7 at 11:09:00.052 am EDT. The launch window
             was 2 hours 30 min. Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB's) seperation
             successful. At 7min 45sec SSME throttled back while Endeavour
             traveling at more than 4miles per sec and 640 miles downrange.
             SSME cutoff confirmed at 8min 30sec.

             Operations to load the External Tank began at 2:20am 9/7/95 and
             were completed at 5:15am. The crew suited up at 7:30am EDT and
             left the Operations and Checkout Building (O&C) at 7:58am EDT.
             The crew arrived at launch Pad 39-A at 8:10am EDT. The hatch was
             closed and sealed but failed to pass its leak check at 9:50am
             EDT. The crew hatch was reopened and the seals checked. Then a
             retest was performed. Another problem late in the count was with
             Water Spray Boiler # 2. The Water Spray Boilers normally
             pressurize to 39 PSI but unit #2 showed a pressure of 38.7 PSI.
             This did not violate any Launch Commit Criteria and the Mission
             Management Team determined the lower pressure was not a
             constraint to launch. Also, there was a minor problem with a
             "safe" talkback indicator on a safe and arm device on the Solid
             Rocket Booster. This problem has been seen before and is
             understood. It was not expected to be of any concern to the
             Solid Rocket Booster Recovery team.

             Earlier in the launch flow, Endeavour's Fuel Cell #2 was
             replaced and the countdown picked up on September 4, 1995 at
             4:30pm at the T-41.5 hour mark (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             9/01/1995) and (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 9/05/1995).

             The Mission Management Team (MMT) decided to scrub the August
             31, 1995 scheduled launch of Endeavour on mission STS-69 due to
             a failure of one of three fuel cells aboard the vehicle. The
             scrub was called at 3:30am on 8/31/95 prior to tanking
             operations. Fuel cells provide electricity to the vehicle while
             in orbit. Mission rules state all three fuel cells must be up
             and operational prior to launch.

             At the 10:30am press conference on 8/31/95, Bob Sieck estimated
             the countdown would pick back up on Monday with a launch late in
             the week. The scrub was called due to a temperature spike in the
             Fuel Cell #2 exit temperature. The fuel cell is located in the
             right side of the payload bay. Fuel cell #2 had 1700 hours of
             operation and cells are typically kept in service until 2400
             hours of operation. A similar fuel cell problem was previously
             detected on orbit during the Spacelab D-1 mission STS-61A and on
             the launch pad during STS-6. During STS-6, the fuel cell was
             replaced on the pad and similar procedures will be used for
             STS-69.

             The countdown had begun at 3pm EDT on 8/28/95. (Reference KSC
             Shuttle Status 8/29/1995). The previous launch date of 11:04am
             8/31/95 was decided after NASA officials held a Flight Readiness
             Review to consider remaining issues in preparing Endeavour for
             the flight. Among the items reviewed and closed out was the
             issue of minor O-ring erosion seen in a joint of the Reusable
             Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) nozzle during the last two Shuttle
             launches.

             The launch was previously placed on hold pending analysis of the
             solid rocket booster (SRB) nozzle o-ring seals. Possible air
             paths in the RTV behind the RSRM Nose Inlet Assembly to Throat
             Assembly joint were investigated. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             8/23/1995).

             There was a rollback of Endeavour on 8/1/95 to the VAB due to
             Hurricane ERIN. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 8/01/1995).
             Endeavour was returned to Pad 39-A on 8/08/95 with first motion
             occuring at 1:55am. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 8/08/1995).

             Old launch date was August 5, 1995 at 10:45am with a 2 hours 30
             minute launch window. Launch date was pending resolution of open
             items including the post flight assessment of an anomaly on one
             of the STS-71 solid rocket booster nozzle joints. (Reference KSC
             Shuttle Status 7/25/1995)

             Rollout to Launch pad 39-A occured on 7/5/95 with first motion
             out of the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at around 11 p.m. The
             Vehicle was hard down on the pad at about 4:30am on 7/6/95. Hot
             fire of auxiliary power units APU units 2 and 3 occured on
             7/6/95. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 7/06/1995)
