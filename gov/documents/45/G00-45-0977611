   Dear Friend:
   I am writing to invite you to join the Workplace Partnership for Life,
   a part of our new national Gift of Life Donation Initiative. This is
   truly a win-win campaign in which everyone can play a significant role
   in recruiting potential organ, tissue, marrow, and blood donors. Think
   of it. If your organs could vote, wouldn't they choose to empower other
   human beings to continue to live?
   As a result of advances in medical research and transplantation
   technology, up to 50 lives can be saved or enhanced by just one organ
   and tissue donor. That's remarkable! However, the need for donated
   organs is urgent. More than 77,000 of our fellow Americans are waiting
   for organs right now. And if we don't do something about it, that list
   will just continue to grow.
   Through the Workplace Partnership for Life, we can do something about
   it. We can build public awareness of the need. We can elect to become
   donors. We can discuss our wishes with our families, friends, and
   co-workers.  We can encourage others to sign an organ and tissue donor
   card and indicate their intent on a driver's license.  We can make it
   clear that if something happens to us, we have already voted. That vote
   is yes! We have elected to help someone else live. A clear choice to
   donate the gift of life.
   The workplace is a great environment in which to create awareness of
   the need for donation. With employers and employees working together,
   we can literally save thousands of lives. We invite major corporations
   and unions as well as smaller businesses, associations, government
   agencies, schools and volunteer organizations to join the campaign.
   Everyone can contribute to creating a donation friendly workplace.
   Please join us. A sign-up form is enclosed. Just complete and return
   it. Also enclosed is an "Ideas for Action" checklist, which identifies
   some possible ways you can educate your workforce about donation.
   Please check those that your organization will implement and/or list
   your own ideas in the space provided. You can return it with your
   sign-up sheet or separately at another time. To share ideas about what
   others are doing and to stay in touch and up to date, we will create a
   new section for the Workplace Partnership for Life at the Initiative's
   dedicated web site at www.organdonor.gov.
   Thank you so very much for your participation. Working together we
   really can make a difference. We can all be winners in this campaign.
   Sincerely,
