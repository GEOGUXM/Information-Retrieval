      Welcome to the NHLBI Programs for Genomic Applications Home Page

     On September 30, 2000, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
     (NHLBI) launched the Programs for Genomic Applications (PGAs). This
     program is a major initiative to advance functional genomic research
     related to heart, lung, blood, and sleep health and disorders.

     The goals of the PGAs include developing information, tools, and
     resources to link genes to biological function on a genomic scale.
     All the information, reagents, and tools developed in the PGAs will
     be freely available in a timely manner to the research community.

     In addition, the PGAs will provide workshops, courses, and visiting
     scientist programs to facilitate the training of researchers in the
     use of the data and related technologies developed by the PGAs.

     The purpose of the PGA Web site is to provide a central place to
     learn about the PGA Program and to provide access to PGA-developed
     resources through links to the individual PGA sites. This web site
     will be updated periodically to provide the most recent information
     available on this NHLBI program.
