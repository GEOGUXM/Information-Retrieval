   Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center - Research

   Most of the NRMSC research and development efforts are organized into
   major scientific ventures, constituting long-term, multi-investigator
   efforts to address large problems.  Many of the challenges facing
   natural resource management require an interdisciplinary approach.
   Because of their complexity, they also often need to be addressed
   through a series of conceptually linked projects.  Current ventures of
   our Center include:
