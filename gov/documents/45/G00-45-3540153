   NOAA Central Library

NOAA Browser

   This site provides direct links to over 500 NOAA science, policy, and
   administrative sites. It is meant to help NOAA personnel, personnel
   from other Government agencies, and the general public navigate their
   way through the many NOAA Internet sites. The NOAA Browser is organized
   in a hierarchical manner that reflects NOAA's organization. In general,
   NOAA's organizational units follow the same structure: main (line)
   component, office, laboratory or division, branch, and down to programs
   and projects.  The NOAA Browser can handle the NOAA organizations which
   operate in a matrix environment.

   A second reason for producing the NOAA Browser is to help interested
   individuals explore NOAA. NOAA's areas of responsibility extend from
   the sun through the atmosphere, from the coastal ocean to the abyss,
   and from the surface to the center of the earth. There are many
   wonderful websites that have been built by NOAA personnel to describe
   their work and scientific endeavors in this vast realm. The Browser can
   help navigate through the nooks and crannies of NOAA's realm.
