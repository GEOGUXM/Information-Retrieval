   $8.5 MILLION LOAN GUARANTEE TO ASSIST ALABAMA CLOTHING MANUFACTURER
   USDA Rural Development Approves Loan Guarantee for Clothier of Military
   and Fire Fighting Uniforms

        WASHINGTON, October 4, 2001--USDA Rural Development officials
   today announced the approval of a conditional commitment for an $8.5
   million loan guarantee to First Bank, who is seeking to assist Terry
   Manufacturing Company, Inc. in the financing of working capital and
   purchase of machinery and equipment.

        "This loan guarantee will help expand job opportunities in this
   rural community of Alabama," said Michael E. Neruda, Acting Deputy
   Under Secretary for USDA Rural Development.

        Terry Manufacturing Company produces battle dress uniform coats
   for the U.S. Department of Defense, fire retardant coats for the U.S.
   Forest Service, as well as a variety of other uniforms and licensed
   apparel. The Roanoke company employs 300 people.

        The Business and Industry (B&I) Guaranteed Loan Program helps
   create jobs and stimulates rural economies by providing financial
   backing for rural businesses. This program provides guarantees up to 90
   percent of a loan made by a commercial lender. Loan proceeds may be
   used for working capital, machinery and equipment, buildings and real
   estate, and certain types of debt refinancing. The program is
   administered by Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS), an agency
   within USDA Rural Development.

        USDA Rural Development serves as the lead federal entity for rural
   development needs, and administers program assistance through three
   agencies: Rural Housing Service, Rural Business-Cooperative Service,
   and Rural Utilities Service. Further information on USDA Rural
   Development can be obtained by contacting any USDA Service Center or by
   visiting USDA's web site at http://www.rurdev.usda.gov.
