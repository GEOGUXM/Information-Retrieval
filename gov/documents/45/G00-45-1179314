   Title 17 Regulations,
   Lanterman Act & Related Laws



      The Department of Developmental Services believes the California
      developmental services community is best served by the open exchange of
      information and opinions. DDS is also committed to providing mechanisms
      for the resolution of problems and complaints when they arise. A number
      of formal processes have been established for handling appeals and
      complaints. The following is a brief description of each process with a
      link to additional information:

   Consumer Rights Complaint Process

             The Consumer Rights Complaint Process is a mechanism to be used
             when an individual consumer, or any representative acting on
             behalf of a consumer, believes that any right has been wrongly
             or unfairly denied by a regional center, developmental center,
             or a service provider. This process is not to be used by
             consumers to resolve disputes about eligibility, or the nature,
             scope, or amount of services. Additional information about the
             Consumer Rights Complaint Process.

   Fair Hearings

             The Fair Hearing process is for resolving disputes with a
             regional or developmental center about eligibility or the
             nature, scope, or amount of services and supports. This process
             is not to be used by consumers to resolve issues related to
             denials of rights. Additional information about the Fair
             Hearings process.

   Early Start Complaint Processes (For Children From Birth to Age 3)

             Early Start is for infants and toddlers under the age of three
             who are at risk of having a developmental disability or are
             developmentally disabled or delayed, and their families. There
             are two separate processes in place for dealing with problems
             which arise under this program. These systems may be used
             concurrently when appropriate.

             The Early Start Comliance Complaint process is used to
             investigate and resolve alleged violations of federal or state
             statutes or regulations governing California's Early Start.
             Additional information about the Early Start Compliance
             Complaint process.

             The Early Start Mediation Conference and Due Process Hearing
             request is used to resolve disagreements between families and a
             regional center or a local education agency related to a
             proposal or refusal for identification, evaluation, assessment,
             placement, or services. Additional information about the Early
             Start Mediation and Due Process Hearing.

   Title 17 Complaint Procedure

             The Title 17 Complaint Procedure is to be used when: (1) one of
             the "personal rights" of an individual who resides in a
             developmental center, community care or health care facility,
             has been formally denied by the facility as allowed in Title 17
             of California Code of Regulation Section 50530; and (2) the
             consumer disagrees with the facility's decision. Additional
             information about the Title 17 Complaint Procedure.

   Family Home Agency Appeals

             The Family Home Agency (FHA) appeal process can be used by a FHA
             applicant or vendor to appeal actions taken by a regional center
             concerning the FHA's vendorization, Certificate of Approval and
             movement of a consumer. Additional information about the Family
             Home Agency appeals process.

   Vendor Appeals

             The Vendor Appeal process can be used to appeal a denial of
             vendorization application, termination of vendorization, or
             failure of a regional center to comply with regulations.
             Additional information about the vendor appeal process.

   Facility Appeals

             A vendored community care facility may appeal the actions taken
             by a regional center regarding service level disapproval,
             sanctions, findings of substantial inadequacy or immediate
             danger, or enforcement of any requirement by the regional center
             which is not contained in Title 17, California Code of
             Regulations. Additional information about the Facility Appeals
             process.

   Rates Appeals

             The Rates Appeal process may be used by a vendor to appeal a
             rate set by the Department of Developmental Services, the
             effective date of the rate, or the denial of a rate adjustment.
             Additional information about the Rates Appeals process.
