           Electrochromic Materials

           Simulations of a Typical Office Installation

           The following simulations show the effects of different glazings on
   video display terminal glare, etc., etc.

   Electrochromic Office Animation
   (3.8 MB MPG)
   Sequence of Events
    1. 15:00:00, sun obscured by a cloud, glass at full transmittance:
       Tvis=74%
    2. 15:00:03, cloud moves away and direct sun enters the office
    3. 15:00:12, electrochromic glazing begins to color at its maximum
       rate
    4. 15:04:06 through 15:17:42, video is in 10X time lapse to prevent
       boredom
    5. 15:17:42, electrochromic glazing reaches its maximum coloration:
       Tvis=3.2%
    6. 15:17:48, the cloud moves in front of sun obscuring all direct sun
    7. 15:17:54, electrochromic glazing begins to bleach at its maximum
       rate
    8. 15:22:18, electrochromic glazing reaches its maximum bleached:
       Tvis=74%
