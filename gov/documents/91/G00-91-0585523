   About the Office
   The Office of Information Technologies (OIT), located in the Trade
   Development division of the International Trade Administration,
   actively supports U.S. information technology (IT) firms' efforts to
   expand their business opportunities overseas. OIT industry specialists
   track the IT industry, both in the United States and overseas; counsel
   businesses on overseas market conditions and the practical aspects of
   exporting their products; identify market barriers as they affect IT
   exports; and work closely with the U.S. Trade Representative to
   negotiate the removal of these barriers. Each year, OIT industry
   specialists write the U.S. Industry and Trade Outlook chapters on
   hardware and software, which describe current and future IT industry
   and market trends on a domestic and global basis. OIT overseas business
   promotion activities include trade missions, catalog shows, and
   technical seminars that introduce U.S. businesses to overseas IT
   end-users.
   Individual OIT staff focus on industry subsectors, including computers,
   networking, software, and Internet and e-commerce technologies, and/or
   on particular regions of the world.
