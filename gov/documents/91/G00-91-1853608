   meeting the basics

   To be a successful government contractor, you need to treat the
   government like a customer. As a business owner, you should think
   through the same issues that you would if you were planning to sell to
   a private company or an individual client:
     * Do you have a unique product or service that few other companies
       sell?
     * Do you know what agency needs your product or service?
     * Do you have core knowledge from years of experience?
     * Can you effectively compete with other businesses?
     * Can your business financially support the execution of a government
       contract with delayed payment?

   The following websites are a valuable source of information when you
   are in the initial planning stages of your business:
     * Small Business Administration
     * Business Advisor

   After you have a solid understanding of your own product or service and
   what the right market is, the next step is to decide whether the
   government is the right customer for you.

   What does the government buy?

   The government spends over $200 billion every year for goods and
   services. In 1999, contracts for services was the largest acquisition
   category at $78 billion. The government also spends money on supplies
   and equipment (35%); agriculture, transportation, communications,
   utilities, and finance (19%); construction (7%); and wholesale/retail
   (3%).

   What are the historical federal contracting trends for women-owned
   small businesses?

   The following website outlines the statutory goals for contracting with
   women-owned businesses and provides data on them:
     * Small Business Administration

   Now that you have determined the government is the right customer for
   your business, you are ready to get started.
