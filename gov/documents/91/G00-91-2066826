   Welcome to the Albuquerque Operations Office (AL), the largest
   operations office of the United States Department of Energy (DOE).
   Besides visiting us in cyberspace, you can also find us physically
   located on Kirtland Air Force Base, in the southeast quadrant of
   Albuquerque, New Mexico. DOE-AL also includes facilities and personnel
   in five area offices and several project offices. DOE-ALÂ’s management
   responsibilities encompass assigned national laboratories, production
   plants, environmental management sites and facilities, and the private
   contractors who manage and operate them for DOE.

   DOE-AL's Contracts and Procurement Division (CPD) & Management &
   Operation Contracts Division (MOCD) Mission: The mission of the CPD and
   MOCD is to support the diverse missions of the DOE-AL through the
   timely acquisition of goods and services, the effective administration
   of awarded contracts and financial assistance instruments, active
   oversight of AL M&O Contractors and their purchasing systems, and
   through the support of our socioeconomic and business community
   interests and responsibilities. Accordingly, this page provides current
   solicitations, draft solicitation documents for industry comment,
   procurement information, and other items that may be of interest. The
   area offices and private contractors under DOE-AL are responsible for
   procuring their own goods and services (see below for links to these
   sites).
