                          REMOTE SENSING - LANDSAT


   TIPS distributed an Orthorectified LANDSAT data set which covers the
   contiguous lower 48 states at full resolution (28.5 meters) in the 7
   (mid-infrared), 4(near-infrared), and 2 (green) band combinations. The
   imagery is compressed into Mr. SID format in the UTM/WGS84 projection
   and is tiled by UTM zone (east to west) and by 5 degree latitude blocks
   (north to south). The imagery is suitable for use as a regional
   basemap, as an accurate reference map to georeference new imagery to,
   for watershed studies, and for Internet Map server type applications.
   The positional accuracy is +/- 2 pixels (50m) and was acquired around
   1990. There are no use or distribution restrictions on this dataset.
