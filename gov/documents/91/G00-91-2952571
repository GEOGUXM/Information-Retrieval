                        SCANNING TUNNELING MICROSCOPE

   The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) is widely used in both
   industrial and fundamental research to obtain atomic-scale images of
   metal surfaces. It provides a three-dimensional profile of the surface
   which is very useful for characterizing surface roughness, observing
   surface defects, and determining the size and conformation of molecules
   and aggregates on the surface. Several other recently developed
   scanning microscopies also use the scanning technology developed for
   the STM. A precursor instrument, the topografiner, was invented by
   Russell Young and colleagues between 1965 and 1971 at the National
   Bureau of Standards (NBS) [currently the National Institute of
   Standards and Technology (NIST)].

     This exhibit was prepared by Marilyn E. Jacox of the Physics
     Laboratory and J. William Gadzuk of the Chemical Science and
     Technology Laboratory as a project of the NIST Museum Committee. It
     is one of the exhibit panels in the NIST Virtual Museum.
