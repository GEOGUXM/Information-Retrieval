Our Predictions

   This is a simple list of all the windows which our neural networks have
   predicted to be RNA genes which you may browse through at your leisure.
   I would like to make it searchable soon so watch this space.

   Both strands of each organism have their own file. The numbering is in
   terms of the forward strand and runs from 5' to 3'.
     * E. coli
          + Forward strand predictions
          + Reverse strand predictions
     * B. subtilis
          + Forward strand predictions
          + Reverse strand predictions
     * M. genitalium
          + Forward strand predictions
          + Reverse strand predictions
     * M. jannaschii
          + Forward strand predictions
          + Reverse strand predictions
     * P. horikoshii
          + Forward strand predictions
          + Reverse strand predictions
