             The primary mission objective will be the third docking between
             the Space Shuttle Atlantis and the Russian Space Station Mir. It
             will include a crew transfer, an extravehicular activity (EVA),
             logistics operations and scientific research.

             Rendezvous and docking with Mir is scheduled to occur on flight
             day three using the same approach as previously used during
             STS-74. Docking will occur between the Orbiter Docking System in
             the forward area of Atlantis' payload bay and the Docking Module
             installed during STS-74 on Mir's Kristall module docking port.

             The mission will also feature a SPACEHAB module, middeck
             experiments, a Get Away Special (GAS) canister and a 6-hour EVA.
             Over 1,900 pounds (862 kilograms) of equipment are being
             transfered from Atlantis to Mir including a gyrodyne,
             transformer, batteries, food, water, film and clothing.

             Planned Experiments include the Mir Electric Field
             Characterization (MEFC) experiment, numerious European Space
             Agency's (ESA) Biorack life sciences experiments, the Queen's
             University Experiment in Liquid Diffusion (QUELD) experiment,
             the Optizone Liquid Phase Sintering Experiment (OLIPSE) and a
             Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Get Away Special (GAS) payload
             Trapped Ions in Space (TRIS) experiment. TRIS will measure
             low-energy particle radiation in the inner magnetosphere.
             Another experiment conducted on Mir during STS-76 will be the
             Mir Wireless Network Experiment (WNE) which was launched on
             STS-74 in November 1995. It will test the first wireless
             client-server network in the space environment.

             The mission will also include KidSat, a prototype of Earth
             viewing cameras and instruments that allows students in grades
             Kindergarden to Grade 12 (K-12) to see and direct the capture of
             pictures from space.

             Mission Specialists Godwin and Clifford are also scheduled to
             perform a six-hour spacewalk on flight day six. They will attach
             four experiments, known collectively as the Mir Environmental
             Effects Payload MEEP, onto handrails located on the Mir Docking
             Module. These experiments include the Polished Plate
             Micrometeoriod Debris (PPMD) experiment, the Orbital Debris
             Collector (ODC) experiment, and the Passive Optical Samples
             (POSA) I and II experiments.

   Launch:

             Launch March 22, 1996 at 3:13:04 a.m. EST. Launch Window was 7
             min.

             The countdown began at the T-43 hour mark at 2 a.m. Monday,
             March 18th, 1996. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 3/14/1996). The
             countdown was conducted from Firing Room 1 of the Launch Control
             Center (LCC) and included 30 hours and 33 minutes of build-in
             holds. (Reference KSC Press Release 32-96). The launch countdown
             proceeded smoothly and launch occured exactly on time at the
             start of the available window. During ascent, the only problem
             noted was a small leak of hydraulic fluid from the hydraulic
             system powered by APU # 3. ( Reference STS-76 MCC Status Report
             # 1)

             Post flight inspections of the mobile launcher platform (MLP) at
             Pad 39-B revealed a 63 foot long crack on one of the MLP steel
             plates running from the north end of the left-hand flamehole to
             the north end of the MLP surface. Cracks are sometimes found and
             easily repaired on the MLPs following launch operations. No
             impact to later scheduled launches is expected. MLP-3 will next
             be used for Mission STS-79 in July. (Reference KSC Shuttle
             Status 3/25/1996).

             On 3/20/96, the Rotating Service Structure (RSS) at Launch
             Pad-39B was rolled back and external tank fueling operations
             were set to begin for a launch at 3:34am EST 3/21/96. However,
             there were high winds and rough seas in the launch area which
             would violate RTLS constraints at the Shuttle Landing Facility.
             Weather forecasts showed only a 20% chance of favorable weather.
             (Reference KSC Weather History 03/20/1996 1800). The shuttle
             mission management team decided at 6:45pm to delay the launch 24
             hours with a new T-0 at 3:12 a.m. EST on 3/22/96. (Reference KSC
             Shuttle Status 3/21/1996).

             The Payload interface verification tests were completed 3/12/96
             and the payload bay doors closed for fight. The Flight Readiness
             Review and the mission management team selected March 21, 1996
             as the official launch date. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status
             3/12/1996).

             The SPACEHAB single module has been installed into the payload
             bay and connected to the tunnel adapter. The Space Shuttle main
             engine flight readiness test was conducted 3/1/96. The Helium
             signature test was done on 3/4/96. The STS-76 crew arrived at
             KSC 3/3/96 at about 8 p.m. for the Terminal Countdown
             Demonstration Test (TCDT) with a simulated engine cut-off at
             11am 3/6/96. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 3/04/1996).

             On 11/27/95, Post flight access was being established. The
             payload bay doors were opened in preparation for removing the
             Orbiter Docking System data analysis is complete with no issues
             or concerns. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 11/27/1995).

   Orbit:

             Altitude: 160 nm
             Inclination: 51.6 degrees
             Orbits: 145 (estimated)
             Duration: 9 days, 5 hours, 16 minutes, 48 seconds.
             Distance: 3.8 million miles (estimated)

   Hardware:

             SRB: BI-79
             SRM:
             ET : SN-77
             MLP : 3
             SSME-1: SN-2035
             SSME-2: SN-2109
             SSME-3: SN-2019

   Landing:

             Edwards AFB March 31, 1996 at 8:28:57 a.m. EST. Runway 22.
             Conditions at EAFB were clear and calm with no weather concerns.
             Landing was 11min before daylight at 5:29am local time which
             under flight rules is considered a daylight landing. The deorbit
             burn fired at 7:24 a.m EST. Atlantis executed a 275degree left
             overhead turn into the landing strip and twin sonic booms were
             heard at Edwards 3min before landing. Main Gear Touchdown at 9
             days 5 hours 15 min 53 sec or 8:28:57 EST. Nose gear touchdown
             at a MET of 9 days 5 hrs 15 min 4 sec or 8:29:08 EST and wheels
             stop at 9 days 5 hours 16 min 48 sec or 8:29:52 EST.

             Time critical science experiments were removed while Atlantis
             was on the runway and the orbiter was towed from the runway at
             5:35pm EST. Towing was completed by 7:23pm EST. (Reference KSC
             Shuttle Status 4/01/1995). Residual cryogenic reactants were
             offloaded and technicians entered the aft main engine
             compartment to inspect the hydraulic system. (Reference KSC
             Shuttle Status 4/02/1995).

             The decision to aim Atlantis toward the one-day-early landing in
             Florida was made by shuttle managers on 3/28/96. KSC was the
             only landing site considered for Saturday, 3/30/96 however the
             landing opportunities were waived off due to trends of clouds
             forming to the south of the Shuttle Landing Facility. KSC
             landings on Sunday 3/31/96 would have required a deorbit burn on
             orbit 143 at 5:57am EST or 7:33am EST and led to landings at
             either 7:00am EST or 8:29am EST. The KSC landings were waived
             off due to weather. (Reference KSC Weather History 03/31/1996
             0700).

             Three landing opportunities existed for a Sunday landing at
             Edwards Air Force Base on orbits 144, 145 and 146. The three
             Edwards opportunities were: an orbit 144 deorbit burn at 7:25
             a.m. EST with a 8:29 a.m. EST landing; an orbit 145 deorbit at
             9:02 EST a.m. landing at 10:06 EST; and an orbit 146 engine
             firing at 10:38 EST a.m. landing at 11:42 a.m EST. ( Reference
             STS-76 MCC Status Report # 17)

             Weather conditions Sunday at KSC were a concern. Early morning
             ground fog, scattered clouds at 1000 ft and thunderstorms within
             30 miles of the landing strip. Weather at Edwards Air Force Base
             was predicted to be acceptable on Sunday. A total of five
             opportunities were present for a Sunday landing, two to KSC and
             three to Edwards. ( Reference STS-76 MCC Status Report # 16)

             After the landing opportunity on Saturday was waived off, the
             crew was given the go to open Atlantis' payload bay doors.
             Latches 5 thru 8 on the doors released (starboard side) but
             latches 9-12 on the starbord side not release. The latching
             system consists of 16 bulkhead latches (eight aft and eight
             forward) and 16 payload bay door centerline latches. Astronaut
             Linda Godwin inspected the latches thru the payload bay door
             windows and the SPACEHAB windows and reported that the latches
             appeared to be open. The astronauts manually commanded the
             latches to open and the payload bay doors opened as expected.

             On 4/6/96, the orbiter Atlantis, bolted atop the Shuttle Carrier
             Aircraft (SCA), aborted its departure from Edwards Air Force
             Base, Calif. after being airborne for only 15 min. The
             orbiter/SCA departed EAFB at 4:55 EST en route back to Kennedy
             Space Center.but about 5 minutes after departure, the flight
             crew of the SCA observed a fire warning indicator light for
             engine No. 3, the right inboard engine. Pilots Gordon Fullerton
             and Tom McMurtry shut down the engine and returned to Edwards on
             the remaining three engines without further incident. The engine
             was replaced and the SCA carrying Atlantis arrived at KSC on
             4/12/96 (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 4/9/1996).
