   TexasOnline Privacy Policy

   TexasOnline is a portal established pursuant to Subchapter I of Chapter
   2054, Texas Government Code and the authority of the Department of
   Information Resources. This policy describes the privacy practices of
   TexasOnline regarding information collected from visitors to the
   portal. It contains information about what data is collected and how
   that information is used. The TexasOnline privacy policy applies only
   to this portal. When you follow a link to another site, even the sites
   of state agencies and local governments, and when you provide
   information to an application operated by a state agency or local
   government, this policy will not apply. You should check the privacy
   policy of each governmental body if you have concerns about how they
   handle personally identifiable information. This policy applies only to
   information collected on TexasOnline itself. This policy may be updated
   periodically, so please check back from time to time.

Collection and Use of Information

   TexasOnline does not sell or rent personally identifiable information.
   Please be aware that when you provide information to any government
   entity, however, that information may be subject to the Texas Public
   Information Act and applicable federal legislation. Information about
   the Texas Public Information Act is available from the Office of the
   Attorney General at http://www.oag.state.tx.us/opinopen/opengovt.htm.
   Additionally, although TexasOnline does not sell or rent personally
   identifiable information, certain state agencies or local governments
   whose sites are accessible through TexasOnline may sell personally
   identifiable information.

   TexasOnline takes reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality
   of credit cards, debit cards, charge cards, and other access numbers
   under its control. Additionally, TexasOnline takes similar measures to
   protect email addresses that you provide through TexasOnline. However,
   TexasOnline does not control the governmental bodies whose sites and
   applications can be accessed through TexasOnline. Each state agency or
   local government whose Web site is accessible through TexasOnline must
   be contacted directly about the records they keep and their use of
   personally identifiable information.

   The TexasOnline Web site utilizes server logs and log analysis tools to
   create summary statistics about the use of the Web site. The summary
   statistics are used for purposes such as assessing what information is
   of most interest to users, determining technical design specifications,
   and identifying system performance or problem areas. These logs collect
   the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your computer, and may collect
   other similar information about your computer network.

   For online government transactions conducted on the TexasOnline Web
   site, you will be asked to enter certain information about yourself
   and/or the organization with which you are affiliated. The specifics of
   this information will vary as required by the type of transaction and
   the state agency or local government involved. In each case, the
   information requested should include the same information that would be
   requested if you performed the identical transaction in person rather
   than online. Whenever TexasOnline requests personal information from
   you, there will be an indication of whether your disclosure of such
   information is mandatory or optional. Information collected in the
   course of the transaction is used for the following purposes:
     * To conduct online transactions with the appropriate state agency or
       local government (e.g., the payment of sales tax or the renewal of
       a license or permit).
     * To send you an e-mail confirming your transaction.
     * To forward new product announcements or content features to you,
       only if you have chosen to request this service.

   TexasOnline uses vendors to provide various services. Your personally
   identifiable information may be shared with such vendors, so that they
   can perform their services for TexasOnline. TexasOnline's contracts
   with vendors prohibit those vendors from sharing and selling
   information from or about the users of TexasOnline.

   TexasOnline may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities
   to provide personally identifiable information to the appropriate
   governmental authorities. TexasOnline fully cooperates with law
   enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for
   illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement
   agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.

Access to Information

   With a few exceptions, you are entitled to request from state agencies
   and local governments providing transactions through TexasOnline
   disclosure of the personal information that they collected about you.
   Pursuant to Sections 552.021 and 552.023 of the Government Code, you
   are entitled to receive and review that information and to have
   inaccurate information corrected. Pursuant to Section 559.004 of the
   Government Code, each state agency or local government must be
   contacted directly to request to review the information held on you and
   to correct any inaccurate information.

   You should note that pursuant to Section 552 of the Texas Government
   Code, a charge may be imposed upon you if you request access to your
   personally identifiable information, but no charge may be imposed to
   correct your personally identifiable information.

Cookies

   Some of the online government transactions hosted by and linked from
   this site use cookies. A cookie is an extremely small text file that is
   stored on your computer and created to track specific information. The
   services hosted on this website (texasonline.com or
   texasonline.state.tx.us) use cookies to set a session ID - this can be
   thought of as a kind of name tag, so the service can keep track of your
   transaction. TexasOnline is configured so that a cookie will be
   destroyed after a few minutes of inactivity, successfully completing a
   transaction or when the browser is closed. If your Web browser does not
   accept cookies, you will not be able to use the online transactions on
   this site. For more information on cookies, you may wish to review the
   U.S. Department of Energy's report on cookies located at
   http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/bulletins/i-034.shtml.

Additional Information

   Within the framework of open government, TexasOnline has a firm
   commitment to protecting the personal privacy of its users. For more
   information on how to protect your personal information online consult
   the U.S. Federal Trade Commission Web site at
   http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/index.html.

Security

   This site uses Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) for secure transmissions.
   SSL applies encryption between two communicating applications, such as
   your PC and the TexasOnline server. When your data is transmitted over
   the Internet, it is encrypted or "scrambled" at the sending end and
   then decrypted or "unscrambled" at the receiving end. Your name, other
   personal information, and all credit cards and other payment
   information that you transmit to us will be protected by 128-bit
   encryption technology, provided your browser is properly configured and
   your computer is operating properly. Security technology requires that
   you have a reasonably current browser that is capable of supporting
   128-bit encryption. Current browsers such as these will activate the
   appropriate security features when you enter an online transaction
   through this site. In general, you can determine whether you are on a
   secure site by looking at the symbol at the bottom of your browser
   screen. If the key is unbroken or the lock is locked it indicates that
   you are using a secure server.

Contact Information

   If at any time you are concerned that your personal information held by
   a state agency or local government whose Web site is accessed through
   TexasOnline is incorrect and you are unsure as to how to correct or
   update it, please contact us at privacy@texasonline.state.tx.us or
   contact the appropriate government partner directly.
