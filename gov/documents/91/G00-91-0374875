FedWorld Today

   The FedWorld.gov web site is a gateway to government information. This
   site is managed by the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) as
   part of it's information management mandate.

FedWorld's History

   In 1992, FedWorld was established by The National Technical Information
   Service (NTIS), an agency of the U S Department of Commerce, to serve
   as the online locator service for a comprehensive inventory of
   information disseminated by the Federal Government. This service
   assisted agencies and the public in electronically locating Federal
   Government information, both information housed within the NTIS
   repository and outside of NTIS.
