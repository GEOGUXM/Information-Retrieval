                              Site Information

   The SalmonRecovery.gov web site was launched on October 17, 2000. This
   site replaces the original Federal Caucus web site
   (www.bpa.gov/FederalCaucus) hosted by Bonneville Power Administration
   (BPA) from November 1999 to October 2000. Virtually all of the
   information from the previous web site is included in this web site.

   Purpose:  The main purpose of the previous web site was to involve
   stakeholders in the development of an "All-H Strategy" for fish and
   wildlife recovery in the Columbia River Basin. The main purpose of this
   site is to keep stakeholders informed about the implementation of the
   strategy by the Federal Caucus.

   Site Navigation:  This web site provides a variety of tools for
   locating information. The top of each web page includes:  1) a menu bar
   with links to the 8 main topic areas of the web site;  2) a "Quick
   Find" menu with links to the most popular web pages and documents; and
    3) a "You are here" tool with links to higher levels of the web site.
   The bottom of each web page includes a "text version" of the main menu
   bar (for text-only web browsers). The "Archive" page includes links to
   documents/publications in chronological order and grouped by
   categories. The "Search" page includes links to a Site Map, a Search
   Engine (for text searches), and Related Links (to other web sites).

   Conditions of Use:  See web site Disclaimer / Privacy Policy

   designed and is currently being maintained by the BPA Power Business
