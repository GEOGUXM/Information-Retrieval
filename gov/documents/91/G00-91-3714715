   Textbook Procurement

   The Office of General Services' centralized contract for Commodity
   Group 20060, Books and Non-Print Library Materials and Related
   Ancillary Services is recommended as the first step in the review
   process for textbook procurement. The contract includes textbooks, new
   and used, available from publishers and jobbers. The contract prices
   are delivered prices and can save as much as 10% on the cost of
   textbooks by avoiding shipping costs. Customers may benefit from
   aggregate volume discounts and additional negotiated discounts. You may
   access the contracts with the web links below or you may contact Judy
   Gibbons, OGS Customer Services at 518-474-6717 for additional
   assistance. NOTICE: School districts are asked to provide OGS with the
   name, address and phone number of your required textbook vendor(s) who
   do NOT appear on the list of New York State contractors. OGS will seek
   to include the designated vendors to our contract and potentially gain
   additional discounts for our customers. Please send a fax request to
   Gail Vankuren at 518-474-5052 or e-mail your request and/or comments
