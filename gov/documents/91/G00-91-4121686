   THE STATE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT / THE UNIVERSITY OF THE STATE OF NEW
   YORK / ALBANY, NY 12234 HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY BRIEF August 2000
   01-2000 www.highered.nysed.gov Financing Higher Education in New York
   State One of the topics to be discussed at the September 2000 Regents
   Legislative Policy Conference will be the financing of higher education
   in New York State. This background paper provides some basic concepts
   and a limited amount of historical data and analysis. It does not
   address the State's priority and emerging needs, the main topics of
   discussion for the Conference. Types of State support for higher
   education in New York New York relies on many sources to pay for higher
   education, including students and their families, State and local tax
   taxpayers and private donors. There are at least five types of support
   that come from the State of New York. ! State appropriations for the
   operating expenses of institutions, the largest share of State spending
   on higher education, provide funds for system and institutional
   operating budgets. Virtually all of these funds go to the public
   sectors, where they keep tuition below cost for all students,
   regardless of income. ! State appropriations for student aid, the
   second largest share of State spending on higher education, provide
   grants and scholarships that go primarily to low- and moderate- income
   students. Student aid is an indirect source of support to institutions
   because it lowers prices for some students. ! State appropriations for
   administration and special purposes support administration (such as the
   Education Department and the Higher Education Services Corporation) and
   special purposes (such as Opportunity Programs and Teachers for
   Tomorrow). ! State "tax expenditures" are not appropriations of State
   tax funds. Rather, they are reductions to taxes to promote college
   savings and enrollment. They tend to benefit middle-income students and
   families. ! State support for capital projects comes in many forms. The
   State may make direct appropriations to institutions for capital
   projects and for debt service for non-residential facilities at SUNY
   and CUNY. Also, by raising funds with tax-exempt bonds, the Dormitory
   Authority of the State of New York and local Industrial Development
   Agencies help both public and private colleges and universities finance
   their capital projects. State Effort: How New York Compares Figures 1 -
   3 show how New York State's spending on higher education compared to
   the eight other large states that spent over one billion dollars on
   higher education in fiscal year 1999-2000. 1 ! Total State effort.
   State spending on higher education per capita, including appropriations
   for institutions, student aid, special programs and administration, is
   one indicator of total State effort. New York State's total spending
   per capita is less than the other large states. (Figure 1) This has
   been true for decades because of our large private sector. ! State
   effort for the operating costs of public institutions. New York spends
   fewer State tax dollars on appropriations to public institutions per
   full-time equivalent student than all the other large states except
   Illinois and Pennsylvania. (Figure 2) In 1997-98 New York ranked 28th
   among the 50 states on this indicator. This measure of support for the
   operations of SUNY and CUNY does not include student aid, special
   programs or State administration. ! State effort for student aid. New
   York spends more than all the other large states on State student grant
   aid per full-time equivalent student. (Figure 3) Institutional Revenue
   and Expenditure Trends State appropriations are only one part of the
   financing picture in higher education, albeit a large part for public
   institutions. Other financial indicators, derived from the Federal
   Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System or IPEDS, provide a more
   complete picture of institutional finances. ! Total revenue is the sum
   of all revenue from State and local appropriations, tuition and fees,
   grants and contracts, endowment income, hospitals and auxiliary
   enterprises (such as bookstores and dormitories) and other sources. Not
   all revenue is devoted to student-related purposes; some is used for
   research and public service. Total revenue at independent institutions
   should not be compared to other sectors because independent
   institutions use a large share of their tuition and fee revenue to
   award student grants and scholarships. ! Revenue from State and local
   appropriations is the share of total institutional revenue paid by the
   State and its localities. Education Law requires total revenue at
   CUNY's and SUNY's community college to be come from three sources.
   One-third should come from State appropriations, one-third from local
   appropriations and one- third tuition and fee revenue. ! Gross tuition
   and fee revenue is the share of institutional revenue paid by students
   and their families or by financial aid that they receive to pay tuition
   and fees. Gross tuition and fee revenue in the independent sector
   should not be compared to other sectors, because independent
   institutions use a large share of this revenue to award student grants
   and scholarships. ! Student-related expenditures estimate the funds
   used for student-related purposes. They include expenditures for
   academic functions (instruction, academic support and student services)
   plus a percentage of institutional support and operations and
   maintenance of physical plant related to those functions. 2 Figures 4-8
   show trends for these indicators from 1980 to the most current year for
   which data are available for the five largest groups of institutions in
   New York State. All trends are in fiscal year 1996 constant (real)
   dollars, adjusted for inflation using the Higher Education Price Index,
   and reported on a full-time equivalent student basis to control for the
   effects of enrollment. Trends within a group are reliable indicators of
   change because institutions within a group tend to report consistently
   over time. Comparisons between groups may be less reliable because
   reporting may not be completely consistent across groups. Trends show
   that: ! real total revenue per student rose for all groups of
   institutions, as did gross tuition and fee revenue; ! real revenue per
   student from State and local government appropriations dropped for all
   groups of institutions except SUNY's community colleges, where they
   rose slightly; and ! real student-related expenditures per student rose
   in all groups except CUNY's community colleges. Results: How New York
   compares On selected indicators of student participation and progress
   in higher education, New York appears to perform at least as well as
   the nation as a whole. (Table 1) ! We have the highest college going
   rate for high school graduates in the nation. ! Our
   freshman-to-sophomore persistence rates appear to be lower than the
   nation's at four-year institutions. If this finding is correct, it may
   be caused by high transfer rates within a system that offers more
   options to students than most other states. However, we caution against
   drawing conclusions from the data because 27 SUNY units did not provide
   persistence data in Fall 1997, the first year of the persistence rate
   survey. ! Our graduation rate compares favorably to NCAA Division I and
   Division II institutions for students seeking bachelor's degrees. ! We
   have a larger percentage of our population with college degrees than
   the nation as a whole. 3 Figure 1 FY 99-00 State Appropriations for the
