   » Category A Diseases/Agents

     The U.S. public health system and primary healthcare providers must be
     prepared to address varied biological agents, including pathogens that
     are rarely seen in the United States. High-priority agents include
     organisms that pose a risk to national security because they
       * can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person;
       * cause high mortality, and have the potential for major public
         health impact;
       * might cause public panic and social disruption; and
       * require special action for public health preparedness.

   » Category B Diseases/Agents

     Second highest priority agents include those that
       * are moderately easy to disseminate;
       * cause moderate morbidity and low mortality; and;
       * require specific enhancements of CDC's diagnostic capacity and
         enhanced disease surveillance.

   » Category C Diseases/Agents

     Third highest priority agents include emerging pathogens that could be
     engineered for mass dissemination in the future because of
       * availability;
       * ease of production and dissemination; and
       * potential for high morbidity and mortality and major health impact.
