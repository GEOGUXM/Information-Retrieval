   As a result of legislative changes to the Public Accountancy Act,
   effective July 1, 2001 all firms established in Washington state and
   performing attest services or using "Certified Public Accountant" or
   "CPA" in the firm title must license with the Board of Accountancy.

   CPAs may only perform attest services in a CPA firm licensed by the
   Board - this includes sole practitioners, partnerships, professional
   service corporations, and limited liability companies.

   The amendments to the Public Accountancy Act provide for non-licensee
   minority ownership of CPA firms.  The Board is currently developing
   rules to provide for non-licensee ownership and registration of
   resident non-licensee owners.

   All licensed CPA firms must participate in the Quality Assurance Review
   (QAR) Program. For more information see QAR and/or WAC 4-25-820.

   To license a CPA firm: A licensee may contact the Board to obtain a CPA
   Firm License Application form. After acceptance of the initial
   application, CPA firms must renew every three years. Renewal forms and
   fees are due by April 30.

   To learn more about CPA firm licensing, see Firm Licensing Commonly
   Asked Questions and Answers and/or RCW 18.04.195, RCW 18.04.205, and
   WAC 4-25-661 and 750.

   Temporary Practice in Washington: The amendment to the Public
   Accountancy Act provides authority for practice privileges to CPAs
   whose principal place of business is outside of Washington state.  The
   Board is currently developing rules to provide for practice privileges.
