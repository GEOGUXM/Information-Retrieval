   Exploring Mars: Blowing in the Wind


   The inflatable rover, and the big yellow "tires" that gave rise to a
                     new concept for a possible device to explore Mars.

      One answer to roving across the surface of Mars may be blowing in the
      wind. Literally.

      Researchers exploring different methods to deliver scientific
      instruments to various Martian locales are studying the potential for a
      giant, lightweight, two-story tall beach ball. Equipped with scientific
      instruments, the so-called "tumbleweed ball" conceived by JPL
      researchers, could potentially explore vast tracts of planetary
      terrain, blown by the wind.

      The wind blowing across the face of the red planet would be the only
      engine needed to move the giant tumbleweed ball from place to place,
      said Jack A. Jones, who is leading JPL's research into various
      inflatable machines for exploring space. JPL's Inflatable Technology
      for Robotics Program aims to create rugged, all-terrain vehicles and
      other devices with low mass and low-packing volume.

      A scientific payload, carrying instruments such as magnetometers or
      water-seeking radar, would be held in place by tension cords at the
      tumbleweed's center. Cameras mounted inside the ball would peer out at
      the local terrain. When scientists identify a promising spot and want
      the tumbleweed to put down roots and sit for a spell, the ball could be
      partially deflated. Then, when it's time to move along again, the ball
      could be reinflated to roll on toward new frontiers.

      "This is preliminary work," Jones admonishes as he prepares for more
      field tests. But he is enthusiastic about the promise this technology
      may hold for the exploration of Mars and other solar system bodies.

      Much of Mars' terrain is sloping and littered with boulders, which
      makes tough going for most vehicles. But researchers were excited by
      the results of tests this summer of a 1.5 meter-tall version of the
      tumbleweed. The tests confirmed that 6-meter diameter (about 20-feet)
      balls should be able to climb over or around one-meter rocks and travel
      up slopes 25-degrees and higher in the thin, but breezy martian air.
