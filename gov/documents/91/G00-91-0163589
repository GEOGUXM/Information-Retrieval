                                    EMLIB

Introduction

   EMLIB is intended for the free distribution of electromagnetics (EM)
   software and related information. The EMLIB staff actively encourages
   anyone with appropriate material to deposit it here so that it can be
   shared (and perhaps even improved) by the greater community of EM
   workers. Appropriate material includes (but is not limited to):
    1. EM analysis codes (for antennas, propagation, scattering, microwave
       devices, etc.)
    2. demonstration codes that document how a given numerical method
       works (providing more detail than can be found in a typical
       published paper)
    3. codes that implement analytic solutions for benchmark problems
    4. math functions/subroutines (e.g. special functions, matrix
       utilities) of particular interest to the EM community
    5. functions or modules for use with commercial analysis or
       visualization codes such as Mathematica, MATLAB, AVS, etc.
    6. mesh generators/pre-processors which could be used with EM analysis
       codes
    7. graphics utilities with EM applications
    8. numerical or experimental results for benchmark problems
    9. educational software
   10. meeting announcements
   11. reports
   12. TeX, LaTeX, troff, etc. macros and style guides for journals and
       conferences of interest
   13. e-mail directory of EM workers
   14. pointers to other sources of software (other relevant anonymous ftp
       sites)

   Future expansion could include a bulletin board or mailing list for
   discussion of EM-related topics.

Procedures for Retrieving Software from EMLIB

   Files may be retrieved via the WWW.

Policies for Depositing Software on EMLIB

   All donated software must be either in the public domain or protected
   via instruments such as the GNU Public License (this legal instrument
   is known as a "copyleft"; it permits free public distribution while
   (essentially) retaining copyright and prohibiting unauthorized
   commercialization and subsequent restrictions on the code's
   distribution).

   It is the donor's responsibility to obtain permission for widespread
   software distribution from their employer and/or sponsor. Any software
   deposited on EMLIB will be presumed to be in the public domain unless
   otherwise noted. Software deposited in EMLIB which contains
   distribution restrictions will be deleted. The EMLIB staff, their
   employers, and their sponsers are not liable for any damage caused by
   the inadvertent release of proprietary or classified software or
   information.

   All software deposited on EMLIB should contain:
    1. source code in a standard language (Fortran, C, etc.)
    2. documentation - a manual, a unix man page, or something similar
       that tells how to build the code and how to use it
    3. sample inputs and outputs (if appropriate)

   Binary executable and object files are prohibited.

   Donations of shareware (a distribution mechanism whereby software is
   distributed freely while requesting that active users send a fee to the
   developer, perhaps to get updates or a manual) and teaserware
   (stripped-down, demo versions of commercial codes) are prohibited.

   The EMLIB staff retains the right to delete any donated material at any
   time.

   There are a variety of ways to organize your contribution. At a
   minimum, we request at least two files:
   The source file program.f or program.c or program.C or program.matlab
       ...
       and the documentation file program.txt

   where the source file contains source code for the specific application
   (including all subroutines and libraries) and the documentation file
   contains both the documentation and sample input and output data sets.

   An example documentation file can read as follows:
    PROGRAM: program.f computes fields radiated from a half wave
             dipole using Pocklington's equation and entire-domain
             sinusoidal basis functions.

    LIBRARIES USED: none

    PRECISION NECESSARY: complex*16, real*8 when more than 5000 expansion
                         functions used.

    REFERENCES:

    SAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT SET:

   More complicated, multi-file contributions are also accepted. If you
   choose to do this, we encourage you to organize your code,
   documentation, and data in a sensible directory structure

   For example, one might organize the code above as:
        dipole/README          - brief description, installation info
              /src/program.f   - source for the main program
                  /sub1.f        "   "   "  a subroutine
                  /sub2.f        "   "   "  another subroutine
                  /Makefile      Makefile for compiling the code
              /doc/program.man - unix man page
                  /program.tex - user's manual in TeX format
              /demo/input      - sample input
                   /output     - sample output

   and then bundle up the files, along with their directory structure,
   using the unix tar command into a single file. For the example above,
   this might be called dipole.tar. This practice ensures that related
   files stay together and that potential users get the entire package.
   Compression via the unix compress utility is encouraged to minimize
   disk space use and transfer time.

   Alternate archiving and compression mechanisms may be considered (e.g.
   shell archives), but we prefer using just tar and compress.

   When you have files you wish to deposit on EMLIB, please send mail to
   emstaff@emlib.jpl.nasa.gov and we will set up a convenient method to
   tranfer your files.

Remarks

   Reduce duplication of effort! Stop reinventing the wheel! Tell your
   colleagues! Put a little polish on your codes and share them with the
   community!
