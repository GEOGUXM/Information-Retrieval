   On the NPDMS Home Page, there are four viewing options for each sale in
   the database:
   spreadsheet prints a plain-text, comma-delimited file containing all
   the information in the database for the specified sale. This function
   allows users to load the information into their favorite spreadsheet
   program and to perform different sort on the file without waiting for
   the information to download over and over.
   items generates a list of all the items in the specified sale, with
   limited information about each item available in list form. The list
   can be sorted on any field. Clicking on a case number in the list
   produces a page about the single item selected, with all the
   information the database contains pertaining to that item.
   lots generates a list of all the lots in the specified sale. Clicking
   on a lot number in the lots screen produces a list of all the items in
   that lot.
   catalog prints a semi-formatted, plain-text, catalog listing sorted by
   lot number. If the listing contains sale prices, the listing is a
   retail sale. Otherwise, it is an auction catalog listing.
                            ______________________________________________

   futuresales generates a list of all future retail sales or auctions.
   The up and coming sales will be displayed with a green background. Past
   sales and auctions during the current month will be displayed with a
   gray background.
