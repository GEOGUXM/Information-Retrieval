   This part of our website contains Significant Weather Charts for
   Alaska, Yukon Territories and British Columbia. On these charts you
   will find color coded station plots which show: temperature, dew point,
   ceiling, visibility and wind direction/speed. A key to the station
   plots are found on each map. The data will first appear at about 10
   minutes past the hour, with a second update at about 25 minutes past
   the hour. Please remember to use your browser's Reload or Refresh
   button if the data doesn't seem to be updating in a timely manner for
   you.
