   Overview

   USGS Coastal and Marine Geology Program investigates the extent and
   causes of coastal impacts of hurricanes and extreme storms on the
   coasts of the United States. Our overall objective is to improve the
   capability to predict coastal change that results from severe tropical
   and extra-tropical storms. Such a capability will facilitate locating
   buildings and infrastructure away from coastal change hazards.

   Extreme storm investigations have three integrated components:
   USGS-NASA-NOAA Lidar Surveys Scanning Airborne Laser Altimetry (Lidar):
   With our partners in NASA and NOAA, USGS acquires laser altimetry
   surveys that are providing unprecedented data to investigate the
   magnitude and causes of coastal change.
   Before and after photos - Hurricane Fran, North Carolina Oblique Aerial
   Video & Photography:
   USGS acquires GPS-controlled pre- and post-storm oblique imagery to
   document coastal changes and to assist in interpreting the laser
   altimetry data.
   Tilting beach house Ground Surveys:
   USGS deploys ground crews to document coastal changes in detail and to
   acquire high resolution GPS ground surveys to verify the laser
   altimetry data.
