                                  FX-Linux

   To demonstrate a technology path for evolution of the National Weather
   Service's (NWS) Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS),
   FSL began an effort to port the D2D (Display 2-Dimensions) code to run
   under Linux on a commodity PC in 1999. In late 2000, the NWS fielded
   the first demonstration systems, and plans to have one PC-based Linux
   system in each of its field offices by early 2002.

   FSL has continued its Linux development work, including porting the
   data ingest/decoding subsystem. An updated description of this work was
   prepared in mid 2001. Elsewhere, PRC Inc., under contract to NWS, has
   developed a Linux version of the communications processor that provides
   the interface between the satellite broadcast and FSL's decoders. This
   is currently being tested at PRC, NWS headquarters, and FSL. The
   diagram below (prepared by NWS) approximates the current test
   configuration.

   Current work at FSL includes exploration of new network technology,
   including a multicast of the data to the user workstations, and some
   experiments with a high-availability cluster for failover management.

   Currently at FSL, we have only one preprocessor (PP1), and only
   satellite images are being processed by it. All other data are still
   being ingested by the old HPRT Communications Processor.

   The following notes are provided by NWS, keyed to the numbers on their
   diagram.
    1. acq_client feeds incoming grid data to instances of acqserver
       running on both PP1 and PP2.
    2. Grid acquisition and storage processes (from acqserver (acqdata) to
       GribDecoder) run in parallel on both PP1 and PP2. Grid data stored
       redundantly in netCDF format on local disks on each node.
    3. The /data/fxa hierarchy is visible to software on both DS nodes,
       both AS nodes, and all workstations. The /data/fxa/Grid
       subhierarchy actually resides on PP1 and PP2 (duplicate copies).
       Details for implementing this remain TBD.
    4. Issue: To limit the interruption of operations that might be caused
       by the failure of one of the PPs, we have the grid ingest processes
       running in parallel on both. That will cause the notification
       server to receive two notifications of each incoming product, one
       from each GribDecoder.
