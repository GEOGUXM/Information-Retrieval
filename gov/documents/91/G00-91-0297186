   SBA U.S. Small Business Administration Guidelines for Nominations Small
   Business Week 2000 Administrator's Message Welcome to the 37th National
   Small Business Week! With a new century and millennium upon us, this
   year's annual celebration promises to be one of our most memorable
   ever. The President sets aside National Small Business Week each year
   to formally recognize the crucial role America's small business
   community plays in the economy. That community is more vibrant than
   ever, with more than 24 million small businesses employing about half
   the American workforce. They've helped create more than 18 million new
   jobs over the last seven years. One of my favorite highlights of
   National Small Business Week is the recognition it gives to our best
   and brightest entrepreneurial talent. That's where you come in. You can
   be a part of this celebration by nominating an outstanding small
   business owner or small business advocate in your community for one of
   several different awards. These include the Small Business Person of
   the Year, Advocate of the Year, and special award categories. This
   brochure gives you a ``how-to'' guide on preparing and submitting a
   nomination package. It also includes a detailed description of each
   award. I cordially invite you to help us celebrate America's thriving
   small business owners and advocates by sending us your nominations.
   Take advantage of this opportunity to thank them for a job well done!
   Sincerely, Aida Alvarez Administrator U.S. Small Business
   Administration Introduction to Small Business Week In recognition of
   the small business community's contributions to the American economy

   partnership with public- and private-sector small business supporters,
   will sponsor special activities honoring the nation's entrepreneurs at
   the local, state and national levels. The presentation of the
   prestigious awards will highlight National Small Business Week
   activities. At the district, state, and national levels, these awards

   states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin
   Islands, and national winners in the Disaster Recovery Award, Small

   be invited to Washington, D.C., during National Small Business Week for
   a series of special events in their honor. A national Small Business
   Person of the Year will be selected from among the state award winners
