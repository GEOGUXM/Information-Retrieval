   Sustainable Seas Expeditions:
   The Sanctuary Perspective

   [sse_jellylogo.gif] The Sustainable Seas Expeditions is a five-year
   project of underwater exploration and discovery of the marine world
   with special emphasis on the national marine sanctuaries of the United
   States. The expeditions are the brainchild of Dr. Sylvia Earle, scholar
   and Explorer -In-Residence of the National Geographic Society. Led by
   Dr. Earle, the expeditions are a project of the National Geographic
   Society in cooperation with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA) and other government agencies, industry, and
   private institutions, made possible by a grant from the Richard and
   Rhoda Goldman Fund. The world renowned National Geographic Society, an
   institution recognized for over a century of achievement in exploration
   and conservation, has project oversight. Ship and staff support are
   provided by NOAA, the federal agency responsible for managing the
   National Marine Sanctuary Program and known for its extensive
   experience in marine research, exploration, data acquisition, and
   product development.

   Project Goals

   The expeditions have four goals: exploration and discovery, scientific
   research, use of cutting edge underwater technologies, and public
   awareness of the marine environment with an emphasis on protection of
   marine species and ecosystems.

   1. Exploration and discovery. Exploration and discovery are the
   centerpiece of the expeditions. As Dr. Earle has said: "The submerged
   part of the continent is less well known now than the western United
   States was to explorers Lewis and Clark when they set out across North
   America nearly 200 years ago." How can we begin to protect these areas
   and the life that inhabits them for future generations when we know so
   little about them? With the assistance of new technologies, the
   expedition team will explore areas never, or only rarely, visited
   before. These explorations will be documented by the observations of
   the pilots and video and still imagery.

   2. Scientific research. In the years ahead, humanity faces many
   challenges in the ever-expanding and complex world of ocean management
   and resource protection. The marine science community will be called
   upon as never before to provide insights to complex questions on
   ecosystem health, economic impacts and tradeoffs, and long term trends.
   The expedition team will conduct many scientific investigations, such
   as habitat characterization, predator-prey relationships, and
   productivity assessments.

   3. New Technologies. The ocean is a challenging and hazardous work
   environment. Effective exploration and research require the right
   tools. Pressure and absence of breathable air make the sea an
   inhospitable place for humans. Technologies to explore the depths can
   be expensive and require considerable logistical support. SSE will
   employ the DeepWorker, a compact, one-person submersible capable of
   diving to 2,000 feet, well beyond the depth achievable with SCUBA gear.
   Other technologies that will be used include compact ROVs, new camera
   systems, shipboard tracking systems, navigational tools, and geographic
   information systems.

   4. Raising Public Awareness. The spirit of adventure inherent in the
   exploration of an uncharted and dangerous world is captivating to young
   and old alike. The compelling nature of the expeditions focuses public
   awareness on the marine world, its wonder and fragility, its special
   nature and importance to human survival. Throughout every field season
   and at every site, numerous educational and outreach events are
   offered. Young people are provided opportunities to participate.
   National and local media are engaged. And the story of the expeditions
   is chronicled daily to the entire world on this Web site and on the
   official site of the expeditions at National Geographic.

   The National Marine Sanctuaries

   Sylvia Earle explained how she decided to focus the Sustainable Seas
   Expeditions on the U.S. national marine sanctuaries:

     "It was tempting to undertake something global -- exploration of
     coral reefs worldwide, a thoughtful mission of polar research or a
     much-needed effort to evaluate the status of deep sea fish and
     creatures that live in the open sea. But after some thought, it
     seemed to me that the best way to use this extraordinary opportunity
     to make a difference would be to focus attention on this nation's
     aquatic backyard-- the underwater part of the United States, from
     the shore to the edge on the Exclusive Economic Zone -- and to build
     on the nation's 27 year old National Marine Sanctuary Program.
     Presently, there are twelve sanctuaries that loosely ring the
     continental U.S. with additional sites in Hawaii and American Samoa.
     The need to explore and protect these special areas is urgent."

   Taken together, the twelve national marine sanctuaries provide a wealth
   of exploration possibilities. From Stellwagen Bank in the northeast to
   the stressed coral reefs of the Florida Keys to the canyons of Monterey
   Bay to humpback whale populations in Hawaii, the sanctuaries represent
   much of this nation's marine diversity.

   NOAA embraced the idea of focusing the Sustainable Seas Expeditions on
   the sanctuaries and welcomed the opportunity to enhance the research
   and educational dimensions of the sanctuary program. NOAA offered
   support for the project from the outset, providing research vessels,
   scientific expertise, and its organizational network. In partnership
   with the expedition team, sanctuary staff have devoted themselves to
   planning and supporting the expeditions.

   Year One -- 1998

   The first year of the project was dedicated to essential planning and
   preparation. Everyone knew at the outset that this project would be
   complex, technically challenging, and fraught with the uncertainties
   that are ever present in ocean exploration and research. Much had to be
   done: logistics, training, safety protocols, advisory committees,
   submersible engineering, scientific review, and more. Without this
   essential preparation, the critical field work conducted in 1999 and
   beyond could not have been undertaken.

   Year Two -- 1999

   The second year of the project was the first field season. April 1999
   marked the inauguration of the at-sea phase of the project. In total,
   the expedition team completed nine missions last year, a very ambitious
   schedule that rigorously tested the team's abilities. The nine visited
   sanctuaries were:

     Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (April 16-26)
     Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary (April 27-May 6)
     Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (May 9-22)
     Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (May 26-June 3)
     Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (June 17-30)
     Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (July 9-15)
     Grays Reef National Marine Sanctuary (July 26-August 6)
     Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (August 16-27)
     Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (Sept. 1-13)

   Throughout the field season, activities were taking place at sea and on
   land. 138 successful DeepWorker dives were completed; there were 12
   open houses, over 30 educational events, eight student summits, and two
   teacher workshops.

   Year Three -- 2000

   This year the expedition team has already visited a tenth sanctuary,
   the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary for two
   weeks in January.

   The major work of 2000, the summer season, will see the team return to
   three sanctuaries for extended periods: Channel Islands (June 3-24),
   Monterey Bay (June 25 - July 20), and the Florida Keys (August). In
   addition the team will conduct work in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, in
   an area known as the Florida Middle Grounds, a possible candidate for
   designation as a national marine sanctuary. The thrust of these
   expeditions will be research and exploration with emphasis on habitat
   characterization assessment of important threatened species, and
   evaluation of the effectiveness of marine protected areas.

   In the Channel Islands, the research team will examine the relationship
   of fish species distributions to the geologic character of the sea
   floor, explore deep-water benthic habitat, and gather information on
   krill abundance and blue whale feeding behavior. In Monterey Bay, SSE
   scientists will compare species abundance and composition in pristine
   places versus areas of high human impact. Other studies will include
   observations of mid-water species in and around the Monterey Canyon and
   continuation of the blue whale work started in the Channel Islands. In
   the Florida Keys, the expedition will focus on deep-water habitats with
   particular emphasis on identifying unstressed and stressed environments
   that could serve as natural comparisons for long term study. During
   work in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, scientists will investigate
   potential prehistoric sites of human habitation along the relict stream
   channels, explore fish population dynamics in the Florida Middle
   Grounds, and examine drowned coral reefs north of the Dry Tortugas.

   SSE's exploration and research activities will be wedded to numerous
   education and outreach programs through events and activities in all of
   the national marine sanctuaries, and others independent of the
   sanctuary program. The National Geographic Society is developing a
   wealth of outreach and education materials, and has launched a world
   class Web offering to bring SSE to the world. Student summits, open
   house events and museum exhibits will provide direct contact between
   students and other members of the general public, and the explorers and
   scientists of the SSE team.

   Although exploration and research are the focus of this year, numerous
   education events will also take place, both at these three sanctuaries
   and at other sanctuaries in the system. A wealth of education and
   outreach events are planned including student summits, open houses,
   museum exhibits, and others. The entire expedition team is looking
   forward to this year's work. A successful year will be a significant
   step towards preserving these special marine areas as our legacy to
   those who will follow.
