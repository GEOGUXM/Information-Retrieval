   Northern District of California U.S.B.C.
   Guidelines
   Rule 9019-1 of the Bankruptcy Local Rules allows the judges of the
   district, or any division, to promulgate Guidelines that inform the bar
   and the public how the judges will normally handle particular matters
   such as the form and content of requests for compensation under 11
   U.S.C. §§ 330 and 331; cash collateral and financing stipulations under
   11 U.S.C. §§ 363 and 364, and Fed. R. Bankr. P 4001(d); and the
   activities of bankruptcy petition preparers under 11 U.S.C. §110. The
   Guidelines are exactly that: they are not local rules, and they do not
   have the force and effect of such rules. Any judge of the district may
   authorize a departure from any Guideline as the judge deems
   appropriate. The following are the Guidelines in effect throughout the
   district or in division indicated.
