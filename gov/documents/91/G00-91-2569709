   PROJECT ABSTRACT

   THE ROLE OF SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY IN FOREST ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS

   The Forest Ecosystem Dynamics (FED) Project at GSFC is concerned with
   modeling and monitoring ecosystem processes and patterns in response to
   natural and anthropogenic effects. The project uses coupled ecosystem
   models and remote sensing models and measurements to predict and
   observe ecosystem change. An important consideration in the
   northern/boreal forest ecosystems that we are addressing is the
   influence of spatial heterogeneity on process scaling and the
   expression of that heterogeneity in remote sensing imagery. The overall
   objective of the FED Project is to use models of forest dynamics, soil
   processes and canopy energetics to understand how ecosystem response to
   change affects patterns and processes in northern and boreal forests
   and to assess the implications for global change. The approach is to
   use coupled submodels of forest, soils, and energy processes to predict
   ecosystem response in terms of forest growth (e.g., biomass, LAI, NPP
   attributes ) and development (i.e., species composition change over
   time). There is also a significant role in the project for remote
   sensing research to relate ecosystem response to observable scene
   attributes.
   The project presently is focused on high latitude areas including
   northern hardwood and evergreen Boreal forests. These forests are
   susceptible to climate change, are under increasing harvesting pressure
   for lumber and paper, and are widely disturbed by wildfires. Climate
   change could have potentially large effects in these areas by driving
   changes in forest composition and structure and soil properties which,
   in turn, could alter carbon balance and albedo across the circumpolar
   boreal forest. Complicating the understanding of how northern forests
   would respond to change is the large variability in forest composition
   and structure across the landscape. This variability is largely the
   result of variations from soil properties and local topography, but
   also occur from wildfire and human activities...MORE
