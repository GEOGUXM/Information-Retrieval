   The Earth is constantly bombarded with a stream of accelerated
   particles arriving not only from the Sun, but also from interstellar
   and galactic sources. Study of these energetic particles, or cosmic
   rays, contributes to our understanding of the formation and evolution
   of the solar system, as well as the astrophysical processes involved.
   The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft carries six
   high-resolution sensors and three monitoring instruments to sample
   low-energy particles of solar origin and high-energy galactic
   particles.

   From a vantage point approximately 1/100 of the distance from the Earth
   to the Sun, ACE performs measurements over a wide range of energy and
   nuclear mass, under all solar wind flow conditions and during both
   large and small particle events including solar flares. ACE provides
   near-real-time solar wind information over short time periods. When
   reporting space weather, ACE can provide an advance warning (about one
   hour) of geomagnetic storms that can overload power grids, disrupt
   communications on Earth, and present a hazard to astronauts.

   ACE orbits the L1 libration point which is a point of Earth-Sun
   gravitational equilibrium, about 1.5 million km from Earth and 148.5
   million km from the Sun. The elliptical orbit affords ACE a prime view
   of the Sun and the galactic regions beyond.
