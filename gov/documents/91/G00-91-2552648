   Privacy Policy

   Thank you for visiting the OEO web site and for reviewing our Privacy
   Policy. Our policy is as follows:

   Information Automatically Collected and Stored:

   We automatically collect and store the following information about your
   visit:
     * the name of the domain you use to access the Internet (for example,
       aol.com, if you are using an American Online account, or
       stanford.edu, if you are connecting from Stanford University's
       domain);
     * the date and time of your visit;
     * the pages you visited;
     * and the Internet address of the web site from which you
       direct-linked to our site.

   We use this information to measure the number of visitors to the
   various sections of our site and to help us make our site more useful
   to visitors. Unless it is specifically stated otherwise, no additional
   information will be collected about you.

   Personally Provided Information:

   You do not have to give us personal information to visit our web sites.

   If you choose to provide us with additional information about yourself
   through an e-mail message, form, survey, etc., we will only maintain
   the information as long as needed to respond to your question or to
   fulfill the stated purpose of the communication.

   However, all communications addressed to the OEO Director or the OEO
   Webmaster are maintained, as required by law, for historical purposes.
   These communications are archived on a monthly basis, but are also
   protected by the Privacy Act which restricts our use of them, yet
   permits certain disclosures.

   Disclosure:

   OEO does not disclose, give, sell or transfer any personal information
   about our visitors, unless required for law enforcement or statute.
   Intrusion Detection:

   This site is maintained by the U.S. Government. It is protected by
   various provisions of Title 18, U.S. Code. Violations of Title 18 are
   subject to criminal prosecution in federal court.

   For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
   available to all users, we employ software programs to monitor traffic
   to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or
   otherwise cause damage. In the event of authorized law enforcement
   investigations, and pursuant to any required legal process, information
   from these sources may be used to help identify an individual.

   Systems of Records:

   Information originally collected in traditional paper systems can be
   submitted electronically, i.e., electronic commerce transactions and
   information updates about eligibility benefits. Electronically
   submitted information is maintained and destroyed pursuant to the
   Federal Records Act, and in some cases may be subject to the Privacy
   Act. If information that you submit is to be used in a Privacy Act
   system of records, there will be a Privacy Act Notice provided.

   Questions about NIH privacy policies should be sent to the NIH Privacy
   Act Officer: wheelest@od.nih.gov.
