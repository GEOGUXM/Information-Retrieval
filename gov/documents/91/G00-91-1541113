   About the NEPP Electronic Packaging (EPAC) Project
     __________________________________________________________________


   The objective of the NEPP Electronic Packaging Project (EPAC) is to
   stay ahead of Mission project requirements by 18-24 months. The primary
   goal of the Project is to expedite cutting-edge technology into
   missions andinstruments during the Mission Formulation phases and to
   obtain electronics packaging information and to sustain the
   availability of that information for broad usage the Agency, industry,
   academia, and other government agencies. Specifically, the NEPP
   Electronic Packaging Project Objectives are to:
    1. Assess the reliability of newly available electronic packaging
       technologies for usage on NASA projects through validations,
       assessments, characterizations and the development of test
       methods/tools.
    2. Expedite infusion paths for advanced (emerging) electronic
       packaging technologies by evaluations of readiness for
       manufacturability and project usage consideration.
    3. Provide NASA projects with technology selection, application and
       validation guidelines for electronic packaging hardware and
       processes.
    4. Utilize the Information Management and Dissemination Project of the
       NEPP Program to retain and disseminate electronics packaging
       quality assurance, reliability validations, tools and availability
       information to the NASA community
