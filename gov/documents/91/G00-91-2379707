     The National Ocean Conference was a major U.S. contribution to the
     celebration of the International Year of the Ocean. It was held in
     Monterey, California, June 11 & 12.
     The conference highlighted the important role the ocean plays in the
     daily lives of people. The attendance of President Bill Clinton and
     Vice President Al Gore demonstrates the Administration's commitment
     to addressing critical ocean issues.

     Organized by Commerce Secretary William Daley and Navy Secretary
     John Dalton, the conference included representatives of academia,
     environmental groups, business and industry, and local, state and
     federal government.

     Oceans sustain life on Earth and provide us with many vital
     resources. They are a source of food, energy, commerce, medicine,
     and recreation. They shape our weather, link us to other nations,
     and are critical to our national security. In the 21^st century, we
     will look increasingly to the ocean to meet our everyday needs.
     Our lives are inextricably linked to the ocean. One of every six
     jobs in the United States is marine-related, and one-third of our
     Gross Domestic Product is produced in the coastal zone through
     fishing, transportation, recreation and other industries. Our
     national security and foreign trade are dependent on preserving
     freedom of navigation on the high seas for military and commercial
     vessels worldwide.
