                           Special Projects (IIS)

   Program Scope
   This program supports research activities exploring new relationships
   between computing, communication and digital content from human
   centered perspectives in order to support communities of users in
   scholarly, social and work contexts. The program promotes
   interdisciplinarity and topical fusion. In particular, it manages the
   Digital Libraries Initiative, a multi-agency research program to create
   large knowledge bases, the technology needed to access them, and the
   means for improving their usability in a wide range of contexts.
