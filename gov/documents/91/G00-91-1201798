   Scientist tests water with new process.

   SHORTCUT TO CLEAN -- Environmental scientists test water at Argonne
   using an innovative process developed with 3M and IBC Advanced
   Technologies. The technology eliminates up to 90 percent of the steps
   previously needed to test water at DOE sites and nuclearpower plants.
