                                  Contractor ID Cards

      Contractors obtain ID cards by presenting an ID Card Application form
     to the Key and ID Office in WH0. The form must be filled out by the lab
      contact for the contractor. A contractor's ID card expiration date is
        set to the Contract Ending Date on the form. When a contractor is
      renewed, the ID card expiration date must also be revised to reflect
       the new End Date. We have been receiving messages from the Lab that
     some contractors no longer work here, when in fact, we know they still
     do. We have tracked this down to the fact that some contractors are not
     renewing their ID cards after their contracts have been extended. When
        this happens, the contractor is removed from the Lab's Contractor
                   database and the Name and Address database.

     It is the responsibility of the contractor's lab contact to fill out a
     new ID Card Application form and the contractor take it to the Key and
      ID Office to get a new card. When a contractor terminates, it is the
      responsibility of the lab contact to return the contractor's ID card
                     and gate pass to the Key and ID Office.

       You can check on your contractors by going to the Lab Directory at
     http://www-tele.fnal.gov/telephone/ and seeing if the person exists in
                the database. If not, their ID card is expired. .
