      ________________________________________________________________

   From time to time, the Bankruptcy Administrator's office will hire
   personnel to fulfill its mission.  Unlike many other federal agencies,
   the office does not use the Office of Personnel Management to meet its
   human resources' needs.  The entire employment process is handled
   "in-house".  In addition to the official posting of positions, we will
   post here any available positions, requisite qualifications and
   application procedures.

                      NO POSITIONS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE
