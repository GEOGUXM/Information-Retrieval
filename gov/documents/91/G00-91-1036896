   By exploring the solar system, new technologies have helped not only to
   further space missions, but have also assisted scientists in unrelated
   local endeavors. Currently, several technology development initiatives
   support the Solar System Exploration missions.

   Transportation and Mobility [dot-blue.gif]
   [whitedot.gif]

   Transportation and Mobility Transportation and Mobility details
   technologies used to impel and maneuver spacecraft. It examines such
   criteria as aerocapture, descent onto a surface, mobility at the
   destination (as in the case of rovers), and sample return.
