 ALEX ZUNGER TO WIN THE AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY (APS) "RAHMAN AWARD" FOR THE
                            YEAR 2001 (OCTOBER 2000)

   Three months after The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society (TMS)
   named NREL's Research Fellow, Alex Zunger, as the recipient of its year
   2001 John Bardeen Award, the President of the American Physical Society
   (APS) declared Zunger as the winner of its year 2001 Rahman prize. This
   award is given annually to a single person "to recognize outstanding
   achievement in computational physics research." The citation to
   Zunger's award reads:

     "For his pioneering work on the computational basis for
     first-principles electronic structure theory of solids."

   This award, centering on a different aspect of Zunger's work than the
   Bardeen Award, focuses on Zunger's development of first-principles
   methodologies for predicting properties of solids. These include: (i)
   The early development of first-principles LDA atomic pseudopotentials
   [Topiol, Zunger, Ratner, Chem. Phys. Lett. 49, 367 (1977) and Zunger
   and Cohen, Phys. Rev. B 18 5449 (1978)]; (ii) the pseudopotential total
   energy and force methods [Ihm, Zunger and Cohen, J. Phys. C 12, 4409
   (1979); (iii) the strategy of simultaneous relaxation of atomic
   positions and electronic charge densities, a precursor to
   Car-Parrinello [Bendt and Zunger, Phys. Rev. Lett. 50 , 1684 (1983)];
   (iv) accurate exchange-correlation functional; (v) the self-interaction
   correction (Perdew and Zunger, Phys. Rev. B 23, 5048 (1981)], and; (vi)
   mixed-basis cluster expansion for prediction of ground state crystal
   structures and the temperature-composition phase-diagram of alloys.
   Other areas of interest of A. Zunger include photovoltaic materials,
   spontaneous ordering in solids (the subject of the year 2001 Bardeen
   Award) and quantum nanostructures and. Zunger's research at NREL is
   funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Basic
   Energy Science, Division of Materials Science, and by DOE's
   Photovoltaic Program.

   Previous recipients of this award include Ken Wilson (1993), John
   Dawson (1994), Roberto Car and Michele Parrinello (1995), Steve Louie
   (1996), Donald Weingarten (1997), David Ceperley (1998), Michael Klein
   (1999) and Michael Creutz (2000).

   This award will be presented to A. Zunger at the annual APS meeting in
   Boston, MA, on June 25, 2001. The announcement will appear in the March
   2001 issues of the APS News.
