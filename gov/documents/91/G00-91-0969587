Spacebased Photometric Performance

     Reliable detection with a >8 sigma statistical significance with >3
     transits (four sigma, single transit) of terrestrial planets
     requires relative photometry of 2x10^-5 on time scales of 2 to 16
     hours. The brightness change due to a transit is proportional to the
     the ratio of the planet's area to that of the star. When observing
     stars the size of the Sun, the decrease in brightness for giant
     planets, such as Jupiter, Saturn or the planet orbiting HD209458,
     etc., is approximately 1%. For planets like Uranus and Neptune it is
     about 0.1%. For Earth-size planets it is about 0.01%. Obstacles to
     achieving the necessary precision are:
     * Variations in seeing and extinction (for ground based observing)
     * Photon shot noise
     * Intrinsic variability of the target stars and
     * Instrument instabilities.

     Variations in seeing and extinction are eliminated by using a
     spaceborne photometer. Shot noise is reduced to an acceptable level
     using Kepler's moderate-aperture photometer. The Sun's brightness
     variations on time scales of a few hours are small compared to the
     necessary precision and, by extension, so are those of most stars of
     similar spectral type and age. The principal challenge in attaining
     adequate photometric precision therefore lies in using a stable
     method of photometry. This is done using the techniques of
     differential ensemble photometry.

     The key factors used to achieve the required differential
     performance for the Kepler Mission are:
     * Differential spatial photometry: The brightness of each target star
       is normalized to the average of all nearby stars, providing
       common-mode rejection in the measuring system.
     * Differential temporal photometry: Transit durations are a few hours
       to less than a day. Brightnesses are compared to data just shortly
       before and after the test interval, so there is no need for long
       term stability.
     * Decorrelation of image motion: Motion due to the image drifting
       over time scales long compared to a transit produce highly
       correlated amplitude variations that can be removed.
     * Optimal weighting of pixels: The individual pixels that comprise
       each star image can be weighted to maximize the SNR.
     * Keeping each star image on the same pixels for three months:
       Eliminates effects of inter- and intra-pixel quantum-efficiency
       variations.
     * Operating the CCDs near full well capacity: Read noise and dark
       current are negligible.
     * Selection of an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit: Stable thermal
       environment and negligible scattered light background.

Proper Photometer Design

     In a well-designed experiment, the total of all controllable noise
     sources should be similar to that of the uncontrollable noise. For
     Kepler, stellar variability is the limiting uncontrollable noise
     source. By design the shot and instrument noises are of the same
     magnitude. Given Kepler's aperture, bandpass and optical efficiency,
     the number of detected photoelectrons, N[e], from a G2 dwarf star of
     magnitude m[v] is given by:

                   N[e] = 7.8x10^8x 10^-0.4 (mv-12) e^-/hr

     For a typical target star with m[v]=12 and an integration time of
     6.5 hours, N[e]=5x10^9, giving a relative Poisson noise of
     1.4x10^-5. Instrumental noise is suppressed because the photometric
     measurements are differential with respect to nearby stars and
     differential with respect to time. By measuring the ratio of the
     brightness of each star to the average of its neighbors on the same
     CCD detector, the Kepler photometry is largely immune to temperature
     variations, drifting amplifier gains and zero-point offsets, as well
     as changes in the focus, alignment and transmission of the optical
     system. This technique of "ensemble normalization" or "common-mode
     rejection" was applied to ground-based photometry of the cluster M67
     by Gilliland et al. 1993. They found that a precision of 8x10^-4
     could be attained at transit time scales, limited by the (often 50%)
     variations in seeing and transmission imposed by the Earth's
     atmosphere. Absolute, not differential, HST photometry of the
     transiting planet HD209458b has also achieved near-Poisson-limited
     precision (6x10^-5 in ten min) with the largest non-random errors
     resulting from rapidly changing environmental conditions related to
     HST's low-Earth orbit.

     Several noise sources are not addressed by differential photometry,
     notably noise arising from spacecraft LOS motion and from some kinds
     of variation of the stellar Point Spread Function (PSF). These occur
     because neighboring stars fall at different fractional-pixel
     displacements relative to the CCD's pixel grid. Also, different
     stars sit on differing distributions of stray light from neighboring
     and background stars. If the position and PSF variations are
     suitably small, this kind of noise can be nearly eliminated by
     decorrelating the time series of relative brightness against the
     accurately measured star positions and PSF parameters. The Kepler
     technology demonstration clearly shows that by applying these
     methods to realistic laboratory measurements, an instrument
     precision of <1x10^-5 was maintained for weeks at a time well at the
     same time detecting transit signals equivalent to Earth-size
     planets.

     In summary, the noise sources limiting Kepler's photometry are known
     and understood. Methods for suppressing them have been proven in
     circumstances ranging from laboratory demonstrations to ground-based
     observations at large telescopes to spaceborne photometry. Applied
     to intrinsically stable time series data from Kepler's benign
     Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit, these same methods can perform
     even better. No new technology is required for Kepler to produce the
     photometric precision necessary for this mission.

Technology Demonstration

     During the past year, an end-to-end laboratory simulation was
     conducted to demonstrate that the technology to do differential
     ensemble photometry at the precision required to detect Earth-size
     planets was ready. The simulation reproduced the important features
     of a spaceborne system including the on-orbit noise sources that
     limit system performance. When software was used that compensated
     for both jitter and drift motions of the images, the measured
     precision routinely produced the required value. A comprehensive
     discussion is further on.
