   [Tropical Meteorology:plane in storm image] AOML's hurricane
   research aims to improve forecasts and advance the basic physical
   understanding of hurricanes and tropical meteorology. A key aspect
   of AOML's hurricane research is its annual program of research
   flights aboard reconnaissance aircraft (two WP-3D turboprops and a
   new Gulfstream IV SP jet) flown by NOAA's Aircraft Operations
   Center.
