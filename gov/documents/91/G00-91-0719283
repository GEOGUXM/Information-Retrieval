   On January 11, 1962, the U.S. Agency for International Development
   (USAID) opened its Mission in the Dominican Republic, making it one of
   the first countries in which USAID was active.  Early aid focused on
   projects in savings and loan associations, irrigation and private
   investment activity.  Today, USAID programs in the Dominican Republic
   (DR) focus on three areas:

     1) Economic Growth and Environment

     2) Population, Health and Nutrition

     3) Democracy and Governance

   In addition, USAID/DR is currently implementing a short-term emergency
   aid, humanitarian assistance program in response to Hurricane Georges,
   which struck the Dominican Republic in September 1998.  The Hurricane
   Georges Recovery and Reconstruction Program is in its final stage and
   is comprised of approximately 50 projects.  This emergency assistance
   program is scheduled to end in December 2001.
