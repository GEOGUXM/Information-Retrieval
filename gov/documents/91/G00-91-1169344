                           INDEPENDENCE DAY, 2000

     I am pleased and proud to join my fellow Americans across the nation
     and around the world in celebrating Independence Day.

     When our Founders set their hands to the Declaration of Independence
     in 1776 and gave life to the United States of America, they took an
     enormous leap of faith. They placed a great trust not only in their
     fellow citizens, but also in all Americans who would follow in their
     footsteps. That trust has been passed from generation to generation,
     and it has been honored by millions of men and women whose hard
     work, sacrifice, generous spirit, and love of country have seen us
     safely through more than two centuries of great challenge and
     change.

     As we come together once again to celebrate the birth of our great
     nation, we reflect on the remarkable achievements that have placed
     us in a position of unparalleled world leader-ship. For the peace
     and prosperity we enjoy today, we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude
     to the great patriots who have come before us. As 21st century
     Americans, we are not only the beneficiaries of their courage and
     vision --- we are also the stewards of their sacrifice.

     It is up to us to preserve the freedom that so many brave Americans
     risked their lives to secure. It is up to us to realize our
     country's highest ideals of justice, equality, and human dignity. It
     is up to us to reject the forces of hatred that would seek to divide
     us and instead embrace our common humanity and the values, history,
     and heritage we share as Americans. Our nation's journey to form a
     more perfect union is far from over; but, strengthened by our
     Founders' vision and inspired by our children's dreams, we are sure
     to reach our destination.

     On this Independence Day, as we celebrate the past, present, and
     future of America, Hillary joins me in sending best wishes to all
     for a wonderful Fourth of July.

     WILLIAM J. CLINTON
