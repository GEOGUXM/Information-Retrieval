   Huntington Botanical Gardens Deployment
   Joint JPL/Huntington Gardens effort We are presently fielding Sensor
   Webs at the Huntington Botanical Gardens in San Marino, CA. The
   gardens, with their wide variety of plant life and microclimates, are
   an ideal site for showing the capabilities of Sensor Webs. Click here
   to view current conditions in the greenhouses at the gardens (see the
   map).

   Lancaster Farms Deployment
   Pod in a field at Lancaster Farms We are presently fielding Sensor Webs
   at the Lancaster Farms in Suffolk, Virginia. This nursery represents an
   entirely new environment for the Sensor Web technology. Click Here to
   see current, real-time conditions at the Lancaster Farms. Refresh the
   browser (click "reload") to update the data (see the map).

   Kennedy Space Center Aquatic Deployment
   Future location of Aquatic Sensor Web We have plans to deploy Sensor
   Web technology at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The lagoons
   around the Space Shuttle launch pads are an ideal site to explore with
   Sensor Webs.
