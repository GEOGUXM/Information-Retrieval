    Antiretroviral therapy may reduce facilitating effects of STDs on HIV
                                transmission

   NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - By reducing levels of HIV in semen,
   antiretroviral therapy can often reduce the HIV transmission risk
   associated with sexually transmitted infections in men, British
   investigators report. However, this is not a fool-proof strategy, their
   findings show.

   In the January 25th issue of AIDS, Dr. S. Tariq Sadiq, of University
   College in London, and associates describe their findings after
   measuring blood and semen HIV levels in 24 HIV-infected men with
   urethritis and 16 HIV-infected men without urethritis (controls). All
   subjects had been taking at least three antiretroviral drugs for a
   minimum of 3 months.

   Seminal viral levels were undetectable in 18 of the 24 men with
   urethritis and 13 of the controls, the investigators found.

   Among men whose blood viral load was undetectable, HIV was detected in
   the semen of one patient with gonococcal urethritis and one with
   non-gonococcal urethritis. In these two cases, levels in semen were
   5928 and 1512 copies/mL at the first visit. After 1 week of treatment,
   seminal viral load dropped to below detectable levels.

   In four patients with gonococcal urethritis whose blood levels were
   poorly controlled, semen levels were also high. In three, the levels
   were lower in semen than in blood and did not change significantly
   following treatment for gonorrhea. The fourth patient had semen levels
   exceeding those in blood, but these were reduced 20-fold after
   treatment.

   Thus, when antiretroviral therapy failed to control blood viral levels,
   the potential risk of transmitting both wild-type and drug-resistant
   strains of HIV-1 was elevated, the research team concludes.
