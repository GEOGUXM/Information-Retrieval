      The Natural Resource Trustees have scheduled no public meetings,
    workshops, or public comment periods at this time. Contact Greg Baker
                      to obtain additional information.

    Contact EPA at 1-800-424-4EPA or at EPA's Region 10 web site to learn
     more about the EPA's remedial process and its public participation
      activities, including forming a Community Advisory Group, public
         meetings, and other public input activities for the Elliott
                             Bay/Duwamish River.

     A public meeting on the Sediment Characterization Study was held on
   October 7, 1998. You may download a black/white copy of the meeting
   handouts. A set of the five color figures (793KB) is also available.

     Hard copies of the final report describing NOAA's interpretation of
   the analytical results of the sampling effort may be obtained by
   contacting Greg Baker.

   The appendices to the report have been divided into three files:
   Appendix A (1,417KB), The Analytical Chemistry and Sample Location
   Data, App. A, cont. (2,207KB), Appendices B and C, (917KB) the Data
   Validation Report and Rectifications to Station Locations.

                         SUMMARY OF SITE ACTIVITIES

   NOAA/NMFS ACTIVITIES:

   In 1998, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
   initiated a sediment characterization study in the lower Duwamish
   River. The study focused on determining levels of polychlorinated
   biphenyls(PCBs) and polychlorinated terphenyls (PCTs) found in river
   sediments in the study area. The study area extends from near the south
   tip of Harbor Island, upstream to river mile 7, which is about a mile
   upstream of the upper navigational turning basin.

   The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), part of NOAA, issued a
   listing under the Endangered Species Act which may affect how natural
   resource issues are addressed in Elliott Bay and the lower Duwamish
   River. Further information is available from the NMFS-NW Region web
   site.

   The Environmental Conservation Division of the Northwest Fisheries
   Science Center, NMFS, has conducted other investigations related to
   salmonids and sediment quality thresholds for various PAHs, PCBs, and
   tributyltin.

   EPA/ECOLOGY REMEDIAL ACTIVITIES:

   On March 19, 1998, NOAA petitioned EPA to conduct an assessment of the
   lower Duwamish River. The assessment process is used to determine which
   sites qualify for the National Priorities List (NPL). The NPL
   prioritizes sites for full scale environmental investigation and
   possible cleanup. See: EPA fact sheet: EPA Sampling. In August 1998,
   EPA issued another fact sheet (EPA Sampling, 8/98 fact sheet)
   describing their planned sampling activities and announcing the
   availability of the sampling plan. In August 2000, EPA and the
   Department of Ecology issued a news release announcing a public meeting
   and public comment period on the Lower Duwamish Waterway Site. In
   December 2000, EPA issued a public notice proposing to add the Lower
   Duwamish Waterway to the National Priorities List. Contact EPA Region
   10 for further information on EPA's remedial activities in the Elliott
   Bay/Duwamish River environment.
