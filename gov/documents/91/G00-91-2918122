   Making quality health care more accessible and affordable for America
   is among Congress' top goals-and the Health Policy Subcommittee's
   mission. Patients' rights, prescription drug benefits, better
   treatments, fewer medical errors, and healthier Americans require
   thoughtful policy leadership--the Health Subcommittee provides it.
