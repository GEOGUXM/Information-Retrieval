     ESRI Contract Information

     Teale's contract with Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc.
     (ESRI), for GIS products is in effect until September 30, 2001. The
     contract was extended to make sure that clients had a way to renew
     maintenance on ESRI software while the DGS Multiple Award Contracts
     were being procured. Now that the MACs are in place and ESRI has its
     separate contract under CMAS clients have numerous ways to procure
     GIS software.

     On May 30, 2001, ESRI was awarded a CMAS contract by the California
     Department of General Services (CMAS No. 3-01-70-1444A) for its
     software licenses, installation kits, documentation, data, software,
     maintenance, training, installation, and implementation services.
     Consulting services are specifically excluded from the CMAS
     contract. The new ArcGIS 8.1 software is included in the CMAS
     contract.

     If you wish to purchase any of the above-identified ESRI items under
     the CMAS contract, please contact ESRI's California Regional Office
     in Redlands, California. They can be reached by fax at (909)
     307-3025, by voice telephone at 909-793-2853 at the following
     extensions, or by e-mail:

     CMAS contract be sent to you. The CMAS contract contains ESRI
     product pricing and support policies.

     Alternate sources for GIS consulting

     Clients who require GIS consulting services after July 1 may want to
     consider these alternatives:

     * Use or develop in-house GIS expertise. There may already be GIS
       expertise in your Department or Agency that can meet your GIS
       needs.
     * Use the services of consultants and other vendors of GIS consulting
       services. There are non-governmental consultants and vendors who
       have long-standing expertise in GIS. These services are available
       both on and off CMAS. The following service providers are listed as
       examples only; their inclusion here does not imply endorsement by
       the State of California:

          + Vestra (CMAS vendor)
          + Psomas
          + ESRI
          + Geo Insight International, Inc.
          + Pacific Meridian (CMAS contract # 3-01-70-1415A)

     * Other State agencies with GIS expertise may be willing to provide
       GIS consulting services. For additional information, please contact

     Teale GIS Data Library

     Information Officer (GIO). Most of the library data became freely
     available on June 29, 2001 at www.gis.ca.gov.

     Digital Raster Graphics (DRGs)

     California DRGs (TIFF images of quad maps) and CD-writing services
     are no longer available from Teale.

     Please check www.gis.ca.gov for information on the public
     availability of California DRGs.

     Teale has informed the United States Geodetic Survey (USGS) that
     effective July 1, 2001, Teale is no longer supplying California
     DRGs.

     Governmental agencies who have a need for DRGs on CD may want to
     consider a different 17-CD statewide set produced for the Natural
     Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and cooperating government
     agencies. These are not exactly the same DRGs currently available
     from Teale; they differ in scan resolution and projection.

     Governmental agencies (only), please contact:
