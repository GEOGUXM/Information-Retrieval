       This is your source for information on up-coming auction sales and
       bid leases of both SWP and Rec Bd lands.  Feel free to browse
       through our listing. Information will be updated periodically, so
       please check.
       All excess property must be declared so and disposed of in
       accordance with Government Codes ยง54220, et seq., and  ยง11011, et
       seq.
       All auctions are open to the public and normally conducted either
       by an oral or sealed bid format.  In most cases a minimum bid
       amount is set before the auction based upon an approved Fair Market
       Appraisal.  Credit terms are available under certain
       circumstances.  All sales are subject to final approval by
       Department of General Services, taking into account any Exemption
       Notices (Delegations of Authority) in effect at the time of sale.
       We hope you enjoy our site. Your comments would be greatly
       appreciated.
