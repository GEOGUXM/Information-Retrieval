   Amendment Process

   Seven editions in 35 years. Obviously, the MUTCD is a dynamic
   publication that has adapted to changes in travel patterns, needs, and
   emerging technologies and materials. Over the years those changes have
   resulted from research, experimentation, and practical experience, with
   the best and most effective devices and practices being implemented.

   Because of the potential for change, FHWA officials continually review
   and consider requests for interpretations, experimentations, and
   changes to the information contained in the MUTCD. This section
   examines the process by which decisions are made to revise, amend, or
   create MUTCD standards.

   Amendment Process for Revising the MUTCD

   When the FHWA assumed responsibility for updating the MUTCD in 1979,
   the agency announced that it would process all future changes to the
   MUTCD through notices in the Federal Register. This means that before
   any suggested revision is accepted, it must go through the 2-step
   Federal Register rulemaking process, a process designed to ensure
   public involvement:
    1. Notice of Proposed Amendments (NPA) FHWA publishes requests for
       changes to the MUTCD in the Federal Register to give the public an
       opportunity to provide comments. These public comments are
       considered in making a Final Rule.
    2. Final Ruling (FR) The Final Rule describes the FHWA's final
       decision concerning requests for changes to the MUTCD. This
       decision can include the following: adopt a change, defer the
       change, pending further research, or adopt a modification to the
       change. Based on docket comments and or other additional
       information received.

   This above process is important because it ensures that all parties
   have the opportunity to offer opinions and concerns about proposed
   changes to the MUTCD. The FHWA considers all comments (whether from
   private individuals, trade organizations, or the NCUTCD) before issuing
   a Final Rule, which is also published in the Federal Register.

   Request an Interpretation

   If you are unclear about an existing standard, or would like
   clarification or interpretation or a proposed or adopted amendment,
   submit your written request to: Federal Highway Administration, Office
   of Transportation Operations (HOTO), 400 7th Street SW, Washington, DC
   20590.

   Change or Update an MUTCD Standard

   If you feel that a change should be made to an existing standard in the
   MUTCD, or you believe that there should be a new standard added, submit
   your written request for changes for MUTCD standards to Federal Highway
   Administration, Office of Transportation Operations (HOTO), 400 7th
   Street SW, Washington, DC 20590. If the FHWA concludes that the change
   has merit, it will begin the Rulemaking Process outlined above.

   For additional information, refer to the wording of MUTCD Section IA.6
   (Manual Changes, Interpretations, and Authority to Experiment)

   To Conduct an Experimentation

   If you think you have an idea for a new traffic control device or a
   different application of an existing device that will improve driver
   safety, but the device hasn't been included in the MUTCD, it is
   possible to experiment with the device or its use. This experimentation
   is conducted in a controlled setting.

   All requests for experimentation should originate with the State/local
   highway agency or toll operator responsible for managing the roadway or
   controlled setting where experiment will take place. That organization
   forwards the request to the FHWA - with a courtesy copy to the FHWA
   Division Office. The FHWA must approve the experiment before it begins.
   Requests may also be forwarded directly to the FHWA Division Office,
   and the Division Office can submit the request to the FHWA Headquarters
   Office. All requests must include:
    1. A statement of the nature of the problem, including data that
       justifies the need for a new device or application.
    2. Describe the proposed change, how it was developed, how it deviates
       from the current standard.
    3. Any illustration(s) that enhance understanding of the device or its
       use.
    4. Supporting data that explains how the experimental device was
       developed, if it has been tried, the adequacy of its performance,
       and the process by which the device was chosen or applied.
    5. An agreement to restore the experimental site to a condition that
       complies with the provisions of the MUTCD within 3 months following
       completion of the experiment. The agreement must also provide that
       the sponsoring agency will terminate the experiment at any time if
       it determines that the experiment directly or indirectly causes
       significant safety hazards. If the experiment demonstrates an
       improvement, the device or application may remain in place as a
       request is made to update the MUTCD and an official rulemaking
       action occurs.
    6. An agreement to provide semiannual progress reports for the
       duration of the experimentation and to provide a copy of the final
       results to the Office of Transportation Operations (HOTO) within
       three months of the conclusion of the experiment. HOTO may
       terminate approval of the experimentation if these reports are not
       provided on schedule.

   A successful experiment is one where the research results show that the
   public understands the new device or application, the device or
   application generally performs as intended, and the device does not
   cause adverse conditions. The "experimenter" must evaluate conditions
   both before and after installation of the experimental device and
   describe the measurements of effectiveness (MOEs) of the safety
   benefits and traffic benefits (e.g., better visibility, reduced
   congestion).
