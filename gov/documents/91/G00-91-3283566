   The Delta

   The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is an important natural resource,
   providing a unique habitat for wildlife, prime agricultural land,
   opportunities for recreational activities, and the source of water for
   two-thirds of California's population. Located south of Sacramento and
   east of the San Francisco Bay, the Delta has historically received 47
   percent of the State's runoff, flowing through the Sacramento, San
   Joaquin, Mokelumne, Cosumnes, and Calaveras rivers. The map in Figure 1
   shows the Delta's drainage area, stretching from the northern border
   with Oregon, to the mountains bordering the southern edges of the
   Central Valley.

   The Delta is a flat, low-lying region of rich mineral and peat soils.
   Originally lush wetland surrounded by riparian woodlands, the
   development of the Delta to its present form began in the late 1850's
   with the Swamp and Overflow Land Act. This act transferred ownership of
   all swamp and overflow land from the federal government to the State of
   California. The State sold these lands, using the proceeds to fund
   reclamation of the swamplands. The marshes were diked and drained,
   creating islands for agricultural development. Today, the levees
   provide multiple purposes including protecting the islands from
   flooding, defining the channels used for commercial and recreational
   navigation, contributing to regional flood control, protecting upland
   habitat areas on the islands, and protecting Delta water quality
   through reduced saltwater intrusion.

   The Delta was given a legal boundary in 1959 with the passage of the
   Delta Protection Act (Section 12220 of the Water Code). Figure 2 shows
   the boundaries of the legal Delta, which include the shaded primary and
   secondary zones.

   Table 1 provides some essential information about the Delta. In 1990
   the Delta area, including parts of Alameda, Contra Costa, Sacramento,
   San Joaquin, Solano and Yolo counties, supported a population of
   410,000. The Delta extends over 738,000 acres, of which 538,000 acres
   are presently used for agriculture, and 64,000 acres support cities and
   towns.

   Waterways interlace the entire area, while 1,100 miles of levees
   protect the islands from flooding. The Pacific Flyway passes directly
   over the Delta, and some of the smaller unimproved islands provide
   suitable habitat for birds and other wildlife. These include 230
   species of birds, 45 species of mammals, 52 species of fish, 25 species
   of reptiles and amphibians, and 150 species of flowering plants.

   Recreation in the Delta

   The Delta provides a variety of recreational opportunities including
   fishing, hunting, boating, camping, picnics, and viewing nature. With
   700 miles of channels, nearly all of which are navigable, it is one of
   the largest waterway complexes in the western United States. The Delta
   also offers secluded, meandering sloughs cloaked with overhanging
   riparian vegetation. Even in drought years when reservoirs throughout
   the State were very low and unable to attract as much recreation, the
   Delta provided the same water-based recreational opportunities as in
   other years.


   The 1996 Delta Boating and Fishing Surveys

   In order to quantify the extent of recreational activities, and to
   identify future development needs of recreation facilities, the Delta
   Protection Commission contracted in 1996 with the Department of Parks
   and Recreation to study recreation uses of the Delta, in particular,
   those related to boating and fishing. The study provides current
   recreation use figures for the Delta for use by the Commission as well
   as by other federal, State and local agencies in their planning
   processes.

   The survey involved two separate mail-out questionnaires. The first
   questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 10,000 registered boat
   owners and 10,000 licensed anglers throughout California, followed by a
   second questionnaire sent to approximately 1,500 people in each group.
   These questionnaires asked a variety of questions such as whether they
   recreated in the Delta or not and why, how often they participated in
   specific recreation activities, when and where these activities occur,
   how much money they spend while visiting the Delta, the adequacy of
   existing recreation facilities, and recent changes in their level of
   participation in these activities.

   According to the surveys, 23.5 percent of registered boat owners and 23
   percent of licensed anglers in California recreated in the Delta in
   1996. For those who did not recreate there, the primary reasons given
   for not doing so was that the Delta was too far from home (53 percent
   of respondents), and that they were unfamiliar with the recreation
   opportunities in the Delta (43 percent of respondents).


   Boater and Angler Characteristics and Activities

   Located near the large population centers of the greater San Francisco
   Bay area and Sacramento, the Delta serves a growing urban and rural
   population. Table 2 shows the top ten counties of origin for the
   boaters and anglers. The list reveals how important proximity of
   residence to the Delta is in the decision of boaters and anglers to
   recreate there. While many of the top counties of origin are the same
   for both activities, they differ in their ranking for visiting the
   Delta.

   Table 2 also lists the main boating and fishing activities, as well as
   the alternative activities, in which the recreators participated. The
   top activity for both boaters and anglers was fishing from the boat,
   with 77 percent of boaters and 88 percent of anglers saying they fished
   from boats. For boaters, the other boating activities in descending
   order of frequency were cruising, swimming from the boat, water skiing,
   sleeping in the boat, sailing and hunting from the boat. For anglers,
   fishing from shore was the second most popular activity and fishing in
   tournaments is third.

   The next top ten activities that the boaters and anglers engaged in are
   also given in Table 2. Sightseeing and viewing wildlife are the top two
   activities for both boaters and anglers. Other popular activities for
   both groups include picnicking, swimming, walking, photographing
   nature, attending special events, RV camping, and visiting cultural or
   historical sites.

   The map in Figure 3 gives the location of recreational facilities in
   the Delta, most of which are located along the waterways. Most of the
   recreation facilities are provided through private marinas. Of the
   public facilities, Brannan Island State Recreation Area provides boat
   launching, camping, swimming, nature interpretation and wind surfing,
   and the Department of Fish and Game owns five fishing access/launching
   facilities that are managed by Sacramento and Yolo Counties. Other
   public facilities include a Department of Parks and Recreation trail
   and access behind Locke, limited access to the US Fish and Wildlife
   Service Stone Lakes Refuge, several East Bay Regional Park District
   sites, San Joaquin County parks, fishing access at Clifton Court
   Forebay (Department of Water Resources) and many urban recreational
   sites in Antioch, Pittsburg, Rio Vista, Sacramento, West Sacramento,
   and Stockton.

   Boater and Angler Recreation in the Delta

   Table 3 provides the survey estimates of boating and angling
   activities, including their duration and frequency. The activities are
   counted in terms of group (e.g., family or friends) trips and days
   spent recreating in the Delta. An estimated 186 thousand groups boated
   on the Delta. These boaters spent an average 26.1 days in the Delta
   during the year. Therefore a total of 4.9 million group days were spent
   on boating recreation. The average size of a group was 3 people,
   implying a total of 14.4 million person days of recreational boating in
   the Delta per year.

   An estimated 169 thousand groups go fishing per year in the Delta.
   These anglers spent an average of 24 days per year in the Delta.
   Therefore a total of 4.1 million group days were spent on recreational
   fishing. Since the average group size was 2.9 people, this implies a
   total of 11.8 million person days of recreational fishing per year.

   The boating activities in Table 3 represent only boating by those who
   owned registered boats (boats with motors). Since people who do not own
   registered boats may also boat in the Delta with canoes, kayaks,
   rowboats or rented boats, this represents a lower bound for boating
   activities. In the same sense, activities connected with fishing in the
   Delta may be underestimated if people fish there without a licensed
   angler in the group.

   We can not estimate combined fishing and boating activities in the
   Delta from the data. Adding the two activities together would lead to
   double-counting since many people would be both registered boaters and
   licensed anglers.

   The Economy of the Delta Region

   The Delta economy, in 1994, represented 1.5 percent of personal income
   in California and 1.8 percent of employment (Table 4). The region
   provides a variety of opportunities for employment. Table 5 gives the
   interindustry transactions in the Delta economy in 1994. Reading the
   numbers as columns, the values represent the amount purchased by an
   industry from different sectors, including value added (essentially
   labor and profits), as inputs used to produce/provide the industry's
   goods or services. For example, in order to produce $911 million worth
   of agricultural goods, the Delta's agricultural industry purchased $77
   million worth of inputs from local agricultural producers and $21
   million of inputs from the local manufacturing sector, while $584
   million went to labor, farm income, and land leases. Reading the
   numbers as rows, the values represent the amount sold by an industry to
   other sectors, exported, or sold as final demand. For example, the
   Delta's agricultural sect or sold $77 million to its own producers and
   $80 million to local manufacturers, and exported $686 million (or 75
   percent) of its output. Total industry outlay (total inputs into
   production) always equals total industry output (total sales).

   Manufacturing is the largest sector, producing $4.5 billion worth of
   goods in the Delta. This is followed by trade (wholesale and retail),
   generating $3 billion in output, and services, creating $2.9 billion in
   output. Agriculture contributes a little under $1 billion to the
   region. The entire Delta generates $21.2 billion in output.

   The transactions tables reflect the fact that the Delta is an open
   economy which relies greatly on trade with surrounding regions. Exports
   from the region are $5.6 billion, while intermediate sales to local
   industries are $4.8 billion.

   Recreation Expenditures

   Table 6 provides average and estimated group expenditures for boating
   and fishing. Although the recreational activity occurs within the
   Delta, many of the expenditures occur outside of the Delta. For
   example, much of the food and supplies may be purchased outside of the
   Delta, and even lodging and recreation occur outside of the Delta if
   recreators stay in or visit other sites outside of the Delta. While the
   majority of boating expenditures occur inside the Delta, anglers spent
   more outside.

   On an average trip, boaters as a group spent $139 within the Delta and
   $96 outside of the Delta, while anglers spent $111 within, and $123
   outside. A general breakdown of these expenditures into lodging, food,
   supplies and recreation is given in Table 6. Annually, boaters are
   estimated to spend $247 million inside the Delta and $171 million
   outside, totaling $418 million. Anglers spend an estimated $186 million
   inside the Delta and $206 million outside, totaling $392 million.

   The Input-Output Model

   Economists have long been interested in estimating the total economic
   impact generated by an activity. In this case we are interested in the
   economic impacts of boating and fishing on the Delta region. These
   recreational activities generate expenditures (see the previous
   section) in the local economy. The local businesses that received these
   funds in turn hire a certain proportion of the local labor and pay for
   local services. The local recipients turn around again and spend a
   portion of their receipts in the local economy. Therefore every dollar
   spent in the region will have multiplier effects that reflect not only
   the direct impact of boating and angling expenditures within the
   economy, but also the ripple effects that these expenditures create as
   businesses and employees spend the money they receive on other
   businesses within the region, to either provide the services necessary
   for their operation or to consume final goods.

   The more that people and institutions buy and sell within the given
   economy, the greater the multiplier effects. In this report we are
   concerned with the impacts of these recreational activities on the
   immediate Delta region. Their impacts on the state of California will
   obviously be much larger since, as shown in Table 6, many of the
   recreational expenditures are made outside of the Delta, and in
   addition, many of the economic ripple effects of the within-Delta
   expenditures will occur outside of the immediate Delta region.


   Economic Impacts of Recreational Boating and Fishing in the Delta

   The IMPLAN (IMpact analysis for PLANning) system, was designed by the
   United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture,
   for the purpose of estimating economic input-output models for any
   county, or group of counties, in the United States. It does this with a
   large database, and software and algorithms to estimate regional
   input-output models from this secondary published data. The system has
   comprehensive and detailed data on every area of the United States, and
   the ability to turn this data into dollar flows or transaction tables
   (e.g., Table 4). In turn, these transactions tables can be transformed
   into multipliers for the region so that the total regional impact of
   increasing or reducing economic activity in one industry (or sector)
   can be estimated.

   Zip-code areas were used to identify the region to be covered in this
   economic analysis. While the area covered does not exactly match the
   official Delta area, the zip-codes were chosen to best designate the
   population that lives within the Delta area, thus representing the
   economically productive portion of the Delta.

   Economic impacts are measured in terms of: (1) total Delta output
   (sales) impacts, (2) Delta income impacts, (3) Delta value-added*
   impacts, and (4) Delta employment impacts. An input-output multiplier
   is the sum of the direct, indirect, and induced effects of
   expenditures. The direct effect occurs when the recreators purchase
   goods and services (i.e., their expenditures). The indirect effect
   occurs when the industries that recreators purchase from must purchase
   inputs and supplies from services and manufacturers within the Delta.
   The induced effect occurs as workers in the Delta receive income from
   those purchases and then spend the income on consumer goods and
   services produced in the regions. Together, these three effects make up
   the total impact on the economy.

   To illustrate these concepts, every dollar spent on lodging in the
   Delta generates a total of $1.87 of economic output (sales) in the
   region, which includes a direct impact of $1, and indirect and induced
   effects of $0.87. It also generates $0.75 in income, and $1.14 in
   value-added. Every million dollars spent on lodging generates 31 local
   jobs.

   Table 7 gives the impacts of recreational expenditures (boating and
   fishing) on the Delta region economy. The first column of figures gives
   the expenditures for boating and fishing in each category estimated in
   Table 6. Because of the multiplier effects, the total boating
   expenditures of $247 million generate $445 million in total output,
   $183 million in income, $279 million in value added, and 8,058 jobs
   within the Delta region. For fishing, expenditures of $186 million
   generate $336 million in total output, $138 million in income, $209 in
   value-added, and 6,152 jobs.

   These values represent 1.7 percent of total Delta income and 3.2
   percent of employment in the Delta for boating recreation. Fishing
   recreation impacts represent 1.3 percent of total Delta income and 2.5
   percent of employment.

   These estimated participation rates and impacts represent a lower bound
   for these activities, since the surveys measured only participation by
   registered boat owners and licensed anglers. To the extent that boaters
   recreate in the Delta without registered boats (e.g., in rowboats,
   canoes, kayaks or rented boats), or people fish without a licensed
   angler in their party, the estimates will understate these recreational
   activities.

   The above analysis suggests that recreational boating and fishing are
   an important part of the Delta economy. The fact that 23 percent of
   boaters and anglers in California recreate here every year further
   demonstrates that the Delta provides an important outlet for water
   recreation in California.

   * Value-added is made up of wages and salaries, dividends, interest,
   and indirect business taxes.
