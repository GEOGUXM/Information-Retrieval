   "Honoring the dead, by serving the living"
     __________________________________________________________________

  Our Mission

   The O.C. County Veterans Service Office will actively pursue the rights
   of veterans and dependents of the United States Armed Forces to receive
   Department of Veterans Affairs benefits. We will work collaboratively
   with nationally chartered veterans organizations, the Department of
   Veterans Affairs and others to assure that veterans and their
   dependents receive the entitlements they have earned for their military
   service.

  Our History

   The veterans service program was established in 1929. The Orange County
   Board of Supervisors under County Ordinance established the County
   Veterans Service Office as an independent program on August 17,1945.
