         [Exterior of FutureFlight Central Building] The NASA FutureFlight
      Central is a full scale airport operations simulator that has the "look
         and feel" of an actual air traffic control tower cab. It supports
          cost-benefit studies, provides a stable platform from which new
      requirements can be derived, enables information sharing among multiple
       users, and tests software performance, safety, and reliability under
       realistic conditions. The FutureFlight Central consists of five major
                                    components:
       1. Two story physical structure replicating a full-scale, air traffic
          control tower including work areas to support pilots, ramp
          controllers, airport operators, FutureFlight Central simulation
          engineers, software developers and researchers
       2. Air traffic control simulation software components and digital
          voice, simulated radio/telephone/intercom system
       3. Computer, data communication network and audiovisual equipment to
          support the simulator, simulation engineers, software developers
          and researchers
       4. Programmable user displays
       5. Virtually seamless, visual display system (screens and projectors)
          of the 360-degree out-the-window field of view driven by the air
          traffic control simulation software and image generators (computer
          hardware)

       The FutureFlight Central can be configured to support subsystems that
        may exist in some airport facilities but not in others. The various
          operational uses of the FutureFlight Central are enabled by the
          flexibility of its modular design and adherence to open systems
       architecture. Using an open architecture allows technology insertion
      during design iterations and throughout life cycle upgrades. It allows
      upgrades to new computation systems and image generators, enabling the
      FutureFlight Central to leverage future simulation technology that will
                            offer improved performance.

      As part of a total simulation environment, the FutureFlight Central has
      the capability to provide spatially related audio background sound for
      context and aural cues coupled with the out-the-window visual display.
      The main source for the background audio will be the image generators.
        Levels and spectral content of the audio to be reproduced will vary
       based on the simulation environment and on readings and measurements
        collected from typical air traffic control facilities. Other audio
      sources will include the BetacamÂ™ VCR, VHS VCRs, multiple disc player
                        and Vid-net (NASA Ames television)

                                     Features
      The FutureFlight Central is unique when compared to typical air traffic
      control training simulators for many reasons. One unique feature is the
       use of glass and mullions in the Tower Cab. Using 1/4 inch, tempered
        glass significantly enhances the visual reality of the facility by
        enclosing it in the same manner as a real air traffic control tower
                                       cab.

         The FutureFlight Central has full size consoles with functionally
          accurate computer displays that replicate controllers' position
       specific equipment. Equipment such as radar, wind indicators, clocks
          and altimeters are simulated using graphical user interfaces on
      16-inch, flat panel touchscreens. The perimeter console design is based
      on existing FAA standards and air traffic control tower configurations.
        The center console design is modular and can be configured to match
                              most tower cab layouts.

        The FutureFlight Central has a highly sophisticated audiovisual and
          data communications infrastructure that supports the real-time,
      computer generated out-the-window visual simulation and all its related
          support functions. The audiovisual infrastructure supports data
      projectors, spatially related and coordinated audio, distributed access
        command and control of equipment and signal paths, and a timecoding
       capability to act as a common reference point for all systems related
        to the simulations. Remote viewing of the simulation in progress is
        done using ceiling mounted cameras in the tower cab. Researchers or
       managers can choose to see single or quad-split images on the screen
        located in the Briefing room. Video recording/playback and editing
           equipment is used for post simulation playback and analysis.

                                  Tower Positions
        The FutureFlight Central supports multiple, simultaneous positions
        inside the air traffic control tower cab on the second floor of the
      facility. The positions supported in the FutureFlight Central represent
      typical commercial air traffic control towers including multiple local
        controllers and ground controllers, flight data/clearance delivery,
      traffic management coordinator, tower cab coordinator, and supervisor.
        Twelve positions can be supported simultaneously in the Tower Cab.

                                 Support Positions
      On the first floor, multiple simultaneous support positions outside the
             tower area are supported. These positions include 5 ramp
          controllers/managers, 13 pseudo-pilots, 3 airport operators, 3
                simulation engineers, 2 software developers, and 2
                            researchers/experimenters.

           The FutureFlight Central's real-time, interactive simulation
           environment consists of several integrated systems. A digital
           communications system (e.g., radios, headsets, telephones and
        interphones) is used by all simulation participants to interact in
      real-time. The computer displays in the Pseudo-pilot, Ramp Control and
       Test Engineer rooms are programmable to accommodate different airport
           configurations and new technologies as they become available.

                                Simulation Software
      MaxSim is the ATC simulation software provided by Adacel Technologies.
         MaxSim is a fully interactive, integrated software with advanced
       research and development capabilities to produce the aircraft flight
       dynamics and highly realistic, complex airport test environments. The
       software is integrated with the FutureFlight Central image generators
       and Intel-based workstations to support both radar and out-the-window
                                visual simulation.

                                 Image Generators
      An important component of the visual simulation is the image generator.
           The FutureFlight Central image generator is Silicon Graphics,
       Incorporated (SGI) Onyx 2 Reality monster configured with 6 graphics
       engines (pipes), and 16 processors. The image generators provide a 60
       Hz screen update rate and a full 360-degree field-of-view with a high
              level of scene complexity (1280x1024) using a combined
          polygon/photo-textured approach to scene rendering, weather and
        environmental/seasonal effects. Photographic quality 3-D models of
      airports based on digitized photographs and other available terrain and
      architectural data are supported. These images can be accompanied with
         fully digitized audio effects to provide a high level of realism.

                                  Record/Playback
         The FutureFlight Central has the capability of recording all data
      elements available in the air traffic control simulation. Data elements
          include, but are not limited to, static and dynamic, simulation
      environment data, static and dynamic aircraft data, all key-ins, button
       presses, and personal identification of air traffic controllers, ramp
       controllers, pseudo-pilots and airport operators. Data elements also
      include all forms of communication over the voice communication system.
       Playback of the visual display is viewable from any eye-point such as
      ramp tower, cockpit or ground vehicle and not limited to the view from
                    the tower or to a 360-degree presentation.

                               Statistical Analysis
         Recorded data may also be used for statistical analyses and other
      reporting requirements. The FutureFlight Central has the capability to
         output data in a format compatible with COTS relational database
       format. Data generated during a simulation is capable of being stored
      and retrieved using a COTS database application package such as Oracle.

                          Audio-Video Recording/Playback
         The FutureFlight Central provides unobtrusive video monitoring of
      activities in the Tower Cab during simulations. This system may be used
       for real time viewing by the staff, visitors, and researchers. Tower
      Cab activities during simulations may also be recorded to videotape for
                      post simulation playback and analysis.

       A general purpose "ambient" microphone provides audio context for the
       visual activities recorded by the subject video monitoring system in
         the Tower Cab. Microphone placement is done to minimize pickup of
                          signals from background noise.

       A centralized and consistent means to synchronize the different media
         and systems supporting simulations and research is provided. This
       capability enhances data analysis and it assures that events and data
      are recorded and reviewed in synchrony with a timeline fidelity of +/-
          1/10 (one tenth) second accuracy across all platforms including
                       computers, video, and audio systems.


   [first floor isometric view] First Floor
   The support positions (ramp controllers/managers, pseudo-pilots,
   airport operations, simulation engineers, researchers, and software
   developers) are located in separate work areas on the first floor of
   the two-story structure. These work areas are equipped with computer
   displays, communication links and access to all the information needed
   to realistically simulate a fully operational airport. The computer
   displays in the Pseudo-pilot, Ramp Control and Test Engineer rooms are
   programmable to accommodate different airport configurations and new
   technologies.

                                   Briefing Room
         The Briefing Room is used for pre- and post-simulation meetings,
      presentations and remote viewing of simulations in progress. This room
      is furnished with 4 tables and 12 chairs that can be easily configured
      to accommodate either formal or informal meetings. The room is equipped
       with a PC workstation, modem and a teleconferencing unit that can be
                         used to connect to remote sites.

          Also located in the Briefing Room is a high resolution, ceiling
         mounted, CRT projector that accepts data/graphics and video input
        signals from a variety of sources. It may be used to project data,
      graphics and video from NASA ARC Vid-net and from the VCRs, multi-disc
      player and BetacamÂ™ recorder/player located in the Test Engineer room.
       The projector may also be used to display quad-split images from the
       cameras located in the Tower Cab. Two full range, stereo speakers are
      installed in the Briefing Room to provide audio context to the visuals
        being displayed. A wall mounted fully integrated access command and
         control panel providing limited signal (audio video and computer)
       selection and equipment control is provided for selecting audiovisual
                                  input sources.

                      [test engineer room] Test Engineer Room
       The Test Engineer room is the master control room for the audiovisual
          and simulation systems. The FutureFlight Central accommodates 3
          simulation engineer positions. The Test Engineer room will also
       accommodate researchers/principal investigators, software developers
       and graphics programmers. The simulation engineer has the ability to
          command and control the dynamics of the simulation environment,
        including initiation, monitoring, suspension and test coordination.

        Two of the simulation engineer positions are equipped with a voice
        communications system that is interconnected with the tower's main
      voice communication system. A 16-inch flat panel touchscreen is used as
      the communication control/status panel. A dual headset jack is located
      under the work-surface at these positions. The simulation engineer has
      the ability to listen and talk to a specific position without affecting
                               the other positions.

                     Ramp/Operations Room [ramp control room]
        The FutureFlight Central supports up to 8 ramp control and airport
          operation positions in the Ramp Control Room. Each position has
       displays that may consist of an out-the-window view as seen from the
       ramp tower and/or a 2-D, top-down view of the airport and surrounding
      airspace. The views are displayed on a 21-inch, color, high-resolution
         (1600x1280-pixel) monitor. Additional workstations equipped with
      21-inch color monitors are available for simulating other displays used
                               by ramp controllers.

        Each ramp control position is equipped with a voice communications
      system that is interconnected with the tower's main voice communication
         system. Two-way radio communications between ramp controllers and
      pseudo-pilots are provided. A 16-inch flat panel touchscreen is used as
      the communication control/status panel. A dual headset jack is located
                     under the work-surface at each position.

                       [pseudo pilot room] Pseudo-pilot Room
        The Pseudo-pilot Room supports up to 13 pseudo-pilot positions. The
      pseudo-pilot positions include a 2-D, top-down plan view of the airport
           and surrounding airspace on a 21-inch, color, high-resolution
         (1600x1280-pixel) monitor. The pseudo-pilot position also uses a
       graphical user interface for entering aircraft control instructions.

       The pseudo-pilot's voice communications system is interconnected with
      the tower's main voice communication system. Each pseudo-pilot has the
      ability to transmit and receive simulated radio transmissions from both
      the tower and the ramp controllers. A 16-inch flat panel touchscreen is
      used as the communication control panel. A dual headset jack is located
               under the work-surface at each pseudo-pilot position.

           [Computer area and a Data Communications area] Computer/Data
                                Communications Area
        This area is divided into a Computer area and a Data Communications
      area. The Computer area contains the rack mounted SGI image generators,
       audiovisual equipment and the Intel-based computers required for the
      D-BRITE displays located in the Tower Cab. The Data Communication area
      has 4 standard, 19-inch equipment racks with space for additional racks
                                    as needed.

                                   Second Floor
           The second floor of the FutureFlight Central accommodates the
       projection display system and the full size air traffic control tower
         cab environment. The Tower Cab portion of the second floor has an
            approximate diameter of 25 feet of operational floor space.

                                     Tower Cab
       [tower cab] The FutureFlight Central Cab has full-scale consoles and
         functionally accurate computer displays that replicate controller
      position specific equipment. There is 1/4 inch, tempered glass windows
       installed in mullions around the Tower Cab to separate the occupants
      from the screens and projectors that provide the out-the-window visual
        display. The FutureFlight Central Cab supports a full complement of
         Level V, air traffic controller, flight data/clearance delivery,
       traffic management coordinator, tower cab coordinator and supervisor
        positions. Up to 12 positions can be supported in the FutureFlight
                                   Central Cab.

      There are many different configurations and types of equipment found in
      air traffic control towers. Some towers may have some unique equipment
       items that are not found in other towers. The FutureFlight Central's
      controller positions are interchangeable to accommodate any air traffic
       control tower configuration. This flexibility is provided through the
       programmable displays that replicate the displays and equipment found
      at each position. Sixteen-inch flat panel, LCD touchscreen monitors are
       installed in the consoles to replicate the displays and equipment for
       each position. Programmable graphical user interface software is used
        to simulate the functional characteristics of the position-specific
                                    equipment.

              [projection room/tower isometric view] Projection Room
       The visual display system consists of 12 rear, projection units. The
       units include first-surface glass mirrors, custom fresnel/lenticular
      acrylic screens and high brightness (260 ANSI lumens), high-resolution
      (2000x2000 pixels) CRT projectors. Each mirrored rear projection screen
       unit displays a horizontal field-of-view of 30 degrees and a vertical
           field-of-view of approximately 52 degrees. Each screen has an
      approximate 375mm (150-inch) diagonal dimension with an aspect ratio of
      3:4. The screens distribute light in a 180-degree viewing cone and are
      high gain, high contrast and high resolution. The screens are installed
                        just outside the Tower Cab windows.
