Overview

   The National Institutes of Health (NIH) will convene a
   State-of-the-Science Conference on Symptom Management in Cancer: Pain,
   Depression and Fatigue, on July 15-17, 2002.

   This two-and-a-half-day conference will examine the current state of
   knowledge regarding the management of pain, depression and fatigue in
   individuals with cancer and identify directions for future research.

   During the first day-and-a-half of the conference, experts will present
   the latest research findings on cancer symptom management to an
   independent non-Federal panel. After weighing all of the scientific
   evidence, the panel will draft a statement, addressing the following
   key questions:
     * What is the occurrence of pain, depression, and fatigue, alone and
       in combination, in people with cancer?
     * What are the methods used for clinical assessment of these symptoms
       throughout the course of cancer, and what is the evidence for their
       reliability and validity in cancer patients?
     * What are the treatments for cancer-related pain, depression, and
       fatigue, and what is the evidence for their effectiveness?
     * What are the impediments to effective symptom management in people
       diagnosed with cancer, and what are optimal strategies to overcome
       these impediments?
     * What are the directions for future research?

   On the final day of the conference, the panel chairperson will read the
   draft statement to the conference audience and invite comments and
   questions. A press conference will follow, to allow the panel and
   chairperson to respond to questions from the media.
