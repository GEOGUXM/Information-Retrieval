   Architect of the Capitol


   The Architect of the Capitol is responsible to the United States
   Congress for the maintenance, operation, development, and preservation
   of the United States Capitol Complex, which includes the Capitol, the
   congressional office buildings, the Library of Congress buildings, the
   Supreme Court building, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Power
   Plant, and other facilities.
     * Responsibilities of the Architect of the Capitol
     * The Architects of the Capitol Since 1793

   Until 1989 the position of Architect of the Capitol was filled by
   Presidential appointment for an indefinite term. Legislation enacted in
   1989 provides that the Architect is to be appointed for a term of ten
   years by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, from
   a list of three candidates recommended by a congressional commission.
   Upon confirmation by the Senate, the Architect becomes an official of
   the Legislative Branch as an officer and agent of Congress; he is
   eligible for reappointment after completion of his term. Mr. Alan
   Hantman, FAIA, the present Architect of the Capitol, is the first
   Architect to be appointed under the procedure established by this
   legislation.

   Dr. William Thornton, whose design for the Capitol was selected by
   President George Washington after a national architectural competition,
   is honored as the first Architect of the Capitol. Dr. Thornton's
   assignment was limited to designing and supervising the construction of
   the new Capitol, under the direction of the Commissioners of the
   Federal District and the President of the United States. However, the
   role and responsibilities of the Architect have changed and grown as
   additional activities have been assigned to the office by Congress.
   Today, in light of the widespread activities under the jurisdiction of
   the Architect of the Capitol, the administrative function competes
   heavily with the architectural and engineering functions of the office.
