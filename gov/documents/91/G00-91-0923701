              Technology and Applications Programs Directorate

     Enable JPL to meet NASAs future needs by providing new capabilities


    Missions
   Current JPL TAP Arrow Future Missions
                         Future JPL

     * Provide stable funding for long-term technology development
     * Develop, grow, and sustain core competencies necessary to ensure
       JPLs future
     * Provide technology products for JPLs missions
     * Promote and enable technologies to and from other sources including
     * NASA Centers, Government agencies, Universities, U. S. industry
     * Capture and exploit JPLs Intellectual Property (IP)
     * Communicate to and engage:
          + JPL and its customers to foster a shared vision of JPL's
            technology capabilities
          + the public and educators to share JPLs technical discoveries
            and spin-offs
     * Provide strategic thinking for JPL leading to appropriate
       investment of resources in technology to achieve our vision and the
       vision of our customers
     * Generate and maintain the TAP Directorate Implementation Plan:
          + Quantifies TAPs goals and strategies
          + Defines accountability from all TAP offices to the plan
     * Lead the Technology Program Integration Working Group:
          + JPLs technology council consisting of technology program
            managers, technology users, and technology developers across
            JPL
     * Lead the process team for "Develop Needed Technology" one of JPLs
       principal business processes
     * Maintain the process for alignment of JPLs technology work and its
       projects, and keep metrics on alignment and infusion for the
       Laboratory
     * Make regular reports to JPLs Future Programs Council (FPC) on the
       status of JPLs technology investments
     * Assist the TAP Director and JPL as needed on technology issues
     * Maintain cognizance of all technology work at JPL
     * Collect information on all technology tasks into databases for
       analysis:
          + Serve as the JPL center representative for the NASA Technology
            Inventory
          + Serve as the collection point and reviewer for Office of Space
            Science for the NASA Technology Inventory
          + Collect information on JPLs reimbursable technology work
     * Determine JPLs progress in achieving its "change goal" for
       technology
     * We will rapidly develop and infuse cutting-edge technology into
       flight missions and instruments
          + Accelerate the infusion of technology through systematic
            alignment, rapid development and maturation, and proactive
            incorporation in flight design;
          + Invest in long-term technologies and processes that enable
            breakthrough capabilities in flight and ground systems;
          + Provide leadership in establishing a national space technology
            collaboration among NASA centers and with other federal
            laboratories, universities, and industry
     * The technology Change Goal metrics consist of the following:
          + JPL Technology Investment
          + Technology Development Partnerships
          + Technology Infusion
          + Internal Customer Care-Abouts
          + NASA Customer care-Abouts
          + Technology transfer and Commercialization
     * Led the NASA Space Technology Working Group (Code R team comprising
       technology directors from the NASA centers) in analysis and
       recommendations on applying 7120.5a to low-TRL technology programs
          + Activity resulted in a draft handbook and recommended
            modifications to 7120.5a both are in review now at the centers
     * Developed analyses of technology health at JPL for use at JPL EC
       focused sessions
     * Serving as co-chair of the Huygens Recovery Task Force to find
       solutions to the probe relay radio anomaly
          + Dealing with spacecraft operational anomalies often involves
            applying either new technology or the same kind of creative
            thought process used in technology work
          + The Galileo S-Band recovery mission is a good example of
            applying significant new technology to solve such a problem
