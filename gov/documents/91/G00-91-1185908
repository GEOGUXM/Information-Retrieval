   About EDWelcome
   Roderick R. Paige

   Welcome to the U.S. Department of Education (ED) web site.

   This award-winning site is designed to help pursue the President's
   initiatives, including No Child Left Behind, and advance our mission as
   a Departmentto ensure equal access to education and to promote
   educational excellence for all Americans. It also supports the work of
   ED offices, led by senior ED officials.

   We've redesigned this site to make finding information easier:
     * The search is improved. When you search, you'll see results that
       are more relevant.
     * Information is presented in multiple ways, including in five
       categories: grants and contracts, financial aid for students,
       education resources, research and statistics, and policy.
     * Audience pages provide selected ED information for teachers,
       principals, parents and families, students, higher education
       administrators and institutions, and grantees and technical
       assistance providers.
     * My.ED.gov lets you personalize the site, so you'll see the latest
       information about your favorite topics each time you visit.

   If you frequented our previous web site, you'll find on the new site
   familiar information about ED:
     * publications and productsreports and studies, research syntheses,
       and the ED Pubs online ordering system.
     * The Guide to ED Programsdescriptions of programs, who may apply,
       and whom to contact for more information.
     * budgethow much the President has requested for federal education
       programs, how much Congress has appropriated for those programs,
       and how much has been allocated for programs.
     * organizational structure - offices at ED, their purposes, programs,
       staffs, and web sites, our organizational directory, and a phone
       directory for contacting ED staff.
     * job openings and more.

   You can still search not only the ED web site, but all ED-funded web
   sitesERIC clearinghouses, regional labs, research centers, special
   education and rehabilitative services organizations, and hundreds of
   others. A-Z Index offers an alphabetical index of the best "starting
   points" on our site for finding out about a topic, and our site map
   provides a bird's-eye view of our entire site.

   You'll find links to ...
     * other government Internet resources for education and libraries
     * colleges and universities, K-12 schools, school districts, and
       state departments of education
     * librariesincluding lists of Internet-accessible library catalogs
       and services
     * education associations and organizations.

   To keep up with breaking ED news, in addition to visiting the news
   page, you may want to subscribe to some of our newsletters and
   services, such as ...
     * EDInfoa free information service that provides two email messages
       each week on new reports, new initiatives, funding opportunities
       from ED, and more.
     * NewsFlashan email-based alert service that announces new
       publications and news from the National Center for Education
       Statistics (NCES).
     * Community Updatea newsletter designed to help communities learn
       from each other as they improve their schools.
     * Satellite Town Meetinga monthly TV program that features national
       experts and local educators discussing improvements in teaching and
       learning.

   Thanks for visiting our web site. If you have comments or questions
   about the site, the Department, or our programs, please let us know.
