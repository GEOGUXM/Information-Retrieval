    The purpose of the Environmental Restoration Project's Communications
                          and Outreach Team is to:
     * provide a framework for presenting understandable and consistent
       information to interested parties during the investigation and
       cleanup of areas that may have been contaminated in Los Alamos
       County.
     __________________________________________________________________

          Goals for the Communications and Outreach Effort include:
     * Broaden the base of involved individuals and groups;
     * Continue to build trust by focusing on personal contact, dialogue,
       and mutual education;
     * Obtain meaningful public input in decisions regarding cleanup
       issues;
     * Learn a better, more cost-effective way of involving the public
       early in the Environmental Restoration Project process;
     * Promote sustainability within the Environmental Management Program
       and the Laboratory by incorporating sustainability principles into
       Environmental Restoration Project activities and programs whenever
       possible; and
     * Ensure that all Environmental Restoration Project activities comply
       with all Department of Energy and New Mexico Environment Department
       requirements for public participation.

                     Programmatic and Regulatory Drivers
   The community outreach and involvement activities of the Environmental
    Restoration Project are governed in part by the Department of Energy
    policies and orders; the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to the
         Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, implemented by the
       Environmental Protection Agency and the New Mexico Environment
     Department, as contained in Module 8 of the Laboratory's Hazardous
   Waste Facility Permit; and by provisions of Appendix F in the contract
   between the University of California and the Department of Energy. The
       Environmental Management Program issues directives that require
                            specific activities.

                               Our Key Publics
    "Public" means the general public, Laboratory employees not directly
    involved in the Environmental Restoration Project, representatives of
     government agencies and elected bodies, and others interested in or
    affected by the Environmental Restoration Project. The Communications
   and Outreach Team believes that University of California employees and
      subcontractors are a valuable asset in informing their families,
    friends, and neighbors and have designed an extensive inreach program
                        to inform this key audience.

   The governing bodies of San Ildefonso, Santa Clara, Jemez, and Cochiti
      Pueblos are involved through a separate government-to-government
     process established under recent cooperative agreements between the
    Department of Energy and those pueblos. Members of all Indian Pueblos
    and Tribes are regularly encouraged to participate in the activities
                           described in this plan.

                              Trends and Issues
   The Environmental Restoration Project began its public outreach program
     in 1991. In 1994, members of the public were invited to brainstorm
     informally on ways to obtain more effective public involvement and
   resolve historic problems of lack of trust and the traditional, one-way
      manner of providing technical information. Three concepts emerged
                            during that session:
    1. Involving the public in a dialogue is more valuable than presenting
       draft information and asking for "public comment";
    2. Reviewing what has worked at other facilities avoids "reinventing
       the wheel"; and
    3. Sending teams of Environmental Restoration Project technical staff
       and experienced interviewers into the community to listen and
       respond can provide helpful suggestions to resolve problems related
       to trust, honesty, and openness.
