                On-board 3D model generation of rock surfaces

      This project focuses on optimizing the use of the bandwidth available
      on a mission in situations where it is desired to retrieve valuable
      geological information from a remote site. We are presently focusing on
      two areas.
       1. To establish a priority on the scientific relevance of images
          available for downloading. During any given mission, due to
          bandwidth constraints, the number of images taken by a robotic
          vehicle (e.g., rover, lander, satellite, etc.) is much larger than
          the number of images that can be returned to earth. Thus, there is
          great interest to establish, automatically, a priority on those
          images that increases the likelihood of sending to earth only the
          images of the rocks or scenes that are interesting.
          The following image shows a prioritization between two images using
          the number of different types of rocks in the image as the sole
          selection criteria.

       2. To reduce the bandwidth requirements on retrieving 3D information
          of a rock formation that has been identified as scientifically
          relevant. A straightforward approach to get such information is to
          transmit various stereo pairs of the formation obtained from
          different positions to permit the 3D reconstruction of the
          formation on earth. Our approach is to use the stereo pairs to
          reconstruct the 3D shape, on board, and the transmit only the
          reconstructed shape and its corresponding texture. In essence, we
          are providing a trade-off between resources: on-board computation
          vs. bandwidth.
          The following images show some steps of the process, i.e., image
          acquisition, single-view range estimation, multiple-view range
          integration and 3D structure encoding. Other steps of this process
          are texture generation, compression / decompression, visualization
          and end-to-end integration.
