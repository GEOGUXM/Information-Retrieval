   Designation Branch

   up-to-the-minute data.

   Shortage designations are based on the evaluation of criteria
   established through regulation to identify geographic areas or
   population groups with a shortage of primary health care services.
   There are two types of shortage designations, each linked to a HRSA
   activity or function. The shortage designations are:
     * Health professional shortage area (HPSA) designation, which is a
       prerequisite to apply for National Health Service Corps recruitment
       assistance. The HPSA designation criteria includes primary medical
       care, mental health, and dental care.
     * Medically underserved areas/populations (MUA/Ps) designation, which
       is a prerequisite to requesting grant awards to plan, develop, and
       operate a community health center under section 330 of the Public
       Health Service Act.

   Other Federal programs also use these shortage designations.

   MISSION

   The Shortage Designation Branch (SDB) is responsible for developing and
   implementing criteria and procedures for designating areas and
   populations having a shortage of primary health care services.

   ACTIVITIES
     * Review and process requests for designation of HPSAs and MUA/Ps.
     * Review governors' requests to certify eligible areas under the
       Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services's (CMS (formerly HCFA))
       Rural Health Clinics Program.
     * Conduct annual review of HPSAs to determine if they continue to
       have a shortage.
     * Provide information about designations for review to each State's
       Primary Care Office and to other interested parties.

   ACCOMPLISHMENTS
     * Publish an annual list of designated HPSAs in the Federal Register.
     * Maintain and disseminate quarterly statistics on the number of
       HPSAs, the number of people residing in HPSAs, and the number of
       practitioners needed to remove the designation.

   COLLABORATIVE LINKAGES

   SDB collaborates with Federal, State, and local organizations that use
   designations in conducting their program activities.

   FUTURE CHALLENGES

   A key challenge is to use available technologies to improve the
   designation process, in effect, easing the flow of data and improving
   response time for reviewing designation requests.
