   The water resources of Minnesota consist of numerous streams, springs,
   lakes, and aquifer systems. The USGS collects and archives water-
   resources data including: streamflow, ground-water levels, and
   water-quality data at hundreds of locations throughout Minnesota. These
   hydrologic data are used in research and hydrologic studies to describe
   the quantity, quality, and location of Minnesota's water resources. The
   collection, analysis, and interpretation of these data are done in
   cooperation with other Federal, State and local agencies, tribal
   governments, universities, and research centers.
