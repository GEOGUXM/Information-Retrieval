   * Introduction

      Electronic public access services have rapidly expanded throughout the
      federal judiciary in the past few years. Currently 187 courts,
      consisting of 205 databases, offer electronic public access services
      through the PACER Service Center. The 187 courts consist of 9
      appellate, 89 district, 89 bankruptcy courts and the Court of Federal
      Claims. The public demand for these services has increased, both in
      terms of the number of registrants and the amount of actual usage, now
      exceeding over 2.5 million calls per annum. Several hundred registrants
      regularly review large numbers of cases in many jurisdictions. Some of
      these registrants, in particular organizations tracking regional or
      national bankruptcy, civil or criminal litigation have requested more
      efficient methods to retrieve case information from multiple court
      jurisdictions. In response to this need, the Judiciary has created the
      U.S. Party/Case Index.
        __________________________________________________________________

   * What is the U.S. Party Case Index?

      The U.S. Party/Case Index is a national index for U.S. district,
      bankruptcy, and appellate courts. A small subset of information from
      each case is transferred to the U.S. Party/Case Index machine each
      night located in San Antonio, Texas at the PACER Service Center. The
      system serves as a locator index for PACER. You may conduct nationwide
      searches to determine whether or not a party is involved in federal
      litigation.
        __________________________________________________________________

   * Are All Courts Available on the U.S. Party/Case Index?

      Not all federal courts participate in the U.S. Party/Case Index. The
      non-particpating courts are listed under option #8 on the dial-up main
      menu and the "Courts not on Index" option on the web main menu. These
      courts do not have data available on the U.S. Party/Case Index. For a
      complete nationwide search, those courts need to be searched
      individually. The list of non-particpating courts found on this site is
      updated nightly.
        __________________________________________________________________

   * Types of Searches

      The U.S. Party/Case Index will allow you to search nationwide by name
      or social security number in the bankruptcy index, name or nature of
      suit in the civil index, defendant name in the criminal index, and
      party name in the appellate index. Each hit produced from your searches
      will give you the party name, the court where the case is filed, the
      case number, and the filing date. In addition, for bankruptcy searches
      you will receive the chapter and for civil searches you will receive
      the nature of suit.
        __________________________________________________________________

          A receipt is displayed at the bottom of the screen indicating the
          number of billable pages and cost for the data on the current

   * How Do I Get More Information on Each Case?

      If you would like access to more information on a particular case you
      have found while searching the U.S. Party/Case Index, such as a copy of
      the docket, you will need to dial into the particular court's PACER
      machine where the case you are interested in is located. If you have
      pre-registered with each court, the login and password you have been
      issued for the U.S. Party/Case Index should work on each court's PACER
      machine. If you experience trouble or want to register for additional
      courts, contact the PACER Service Center.
      If you are using the web version of the U.S. Party/Case Index and the
      data is available on an Internet PACER court, the Case Number will be a
      link to the case summary information at that court. In this case, all
      you need to do is click the case number.
