   Advancing the AFV Choice

      Advancing the Alternative Fuel Vehicle (AFV) Choice events are taking
      place in cities across the nation. AFV Choice events take the
      "one-stop" shopping approach by bringing fleet managers together with
      vehicle manufacturers, dealers, fuel providers, and equipment
      suppliers, in an effort to familiarize the fleet managers with the
      range of vehicles and alternative fuel options available to them. To
      aid coalitions in planning events the Clean Cities Program has
      developed a series of planning documents listed below.

   Advancing the Choice Events Script

     This script provides a short explanation of each document in the
   attendee packet. Events should include an agenda item for Coordinators
   to walk attendees through the packet contents.
