   The Chesapeake Bay was listed as an "impaired water body" under the
   Clean Water Act due to excess nutrients and sediment. Improvements in
   the water-quality conditions must be made by 2010, or regulatory
   approaches to achieve these standards will be implemented.

   Many variables effect the water quality in the Chesapeake Bay..

   [w_spacer.gif]   white image spacer Additionally, toxic constituents
   threaten the living resources of the Bay and it's watershed. The USGS
   is addressing sources and delivery of sediment, nutrients, and toxics
   to the Bay. The USGS also measures stream flow and ground water, which
   transports the nutrients, sediment and toxics from the watershed to the
   Bay.
