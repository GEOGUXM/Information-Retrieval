     "Lung cancer presents a series of unique problems related to the
     virulence of the cancer itself and the response of the medical,
     scientific, and lay communities to its devastating impact on
     society. The lung defines our ability to breathe, and the loss of
     this capacity is one of the most frightening of all medical
     symptoms. Because it is a disease primarily of older patients who
     have smoked, lung cancer's negative impact on breathing compounds
     the concurrent effects of chronic smoking-related obstructive
     pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease. Lung cancer is the
     leading cause of death for both men and women and kills more
     patients than the next five most common cancers combined. Fully 85
     percent of the patients who develop lung cancer die from it."

     "Ultimately, progress against lung cancer will depend on a
     concerted, multidisciplinary effort. The priorities outlined in the
     Report of the Lung Cancer PRG provide a framework for such an
     effort. It is hoped that, by fully addressing these priorities, we
     will effect a marked improvement in the understanding, prevention,
     detection, and treatment of lung cancer."
