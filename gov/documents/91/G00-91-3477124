   which plaintiff contends entitle plaintiff to relief. The brief shall
   contain under the appropriate headings and in the order here indicated:
   (a) A statement of the issues presented for review, set forth in
   separate numbered paragraphs. (b) A statement of the case. This
   statement should indicate briefly the course of the proceeding and its
   disposition at the administrative level and should set forth a general
   statement of the facts. The statement of the facts shall include
   plaintiff's age, education, work experience and a summary of other
   evidence of record. Each statement of fact shall be supported by
   reference to the page in the record where the evidence may be found.
   (c) An argument. The argument may be preceded by a summary. The
   argument shall be divided into sections separately treating each issue
   and must set forth the contentions of plaintiff with respect to the
   issues presented and reasons therefor. Each contention must be
   supported by specific reference to the portion of the record relied
   upon and by citations to statutes, regulations, and cases supporting
   plaintiff's position. Cases from other districts and circuits should be
   cited only in conjunction with relevant cases from this jurisdiction or
   if authority on point from this jurisdiction does not exist Citations
   to unreported district court opinions must be accompanied by a copy of
   the opinion. (d) A short conclusion stating the relief sought. The
   issue before the Court are limited to the issues properly raised in the
   briefs. 2 (2) Within forty-five (45) days after service of plaintiff's
   brief, defendant shall serve and file a brief which responds
   specifically to each issue raised by plaintiff. Defendant's brief shall
   conform to the requirements set forth above for plaintiff's brief,
   except that a statement of the issues and a statement of the case need
   not be made unless defendant is dissatisfied with plaintiff's statement
   thereof. No party shall file or serve a brief that exceeds twenty-five
   (25) pages in length, double spaced, unless leave of the judge hearing
   the appeal is obtained prior to filing the brief. All briefs shall be
   in the form proscribed by Local Rule 10.1(a) and shall contain a table
   of contents and, wherever possible, parallel citations. IT IS FURTHER
   ORDERED, that upon the receipt of the defendant's Brief as provided
   herein, the Clerk shall forward the entire file to the assigned
   Magistrate Judge. The Magistrate Judge will treat the proceeding as if
   both parties had accompanied their briefs with a motion for judgment on
   the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12 (c) of the Federal Rules of Civil
   Procedure, and it is further ORDERED that when a plaintiff wishes to
   support an appeal with new evidence, such evidence must be accompanied
   by a legal memorandum setting forth an argument for the acceptance of
   the new evidence based upon the three-part showing required by the
   regulations. First, a plaintiff must show that the evidence he or she
   wishes to submit is "new" and not simply restating information that is
   already in the record. Second, a plaintiff must show that the new
   evidence is "material." In other words, it must be shown that the
   evidence is relevant to the plaintiff's condition during the time
   period for which 3 benefits were denied and that the evidence helps to
   prove that the plaintiff is in fact entitled to benefits. Third, the
   memorandum must include a statement setting forth good cause for the
   failure to present the evidence earlier. Tirado v. Bowen, 842 F.2d 595,
   597 (2d Cir. 1988). See also 42 U.S.C. ยง 405(g) (1995). The new
   evidence and accompanying memorandum shall be filed and a copy shall be
   served upon the counsel for the Commissioner of Social Security, the
   United States Attorney. Upon receipt, the United States Attorney will
   have THIRTY (30) DAYS to file opposition papers. And it is further
   ORDERED, that generally no oral argument will be heard. If, however, an
   oral hearing is requested and scheduled before the assigned Magistrate
   Judge, notice of same will be sent to the parties, and at said hearing
   counsel should be fully prepared to argue the facts, issues, and legal
   contentions in this case, and it is further ORDERED, that the Clerk
   shall serve a copy of this Order upon counsel for the parties herein
   upon the filing of the complaint, and it is further ORDERED, that the
   Clerk shall notify the parties of the name of the Magistrate Judge
   assigned to their proceeding. ORDERED, that this General Order shall
   apply to all United States Magistrate Judges in the Northern District
   of New York. 4 NOTIFICATION OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF FAILING TO FILE A
   BRIEF AS REQUIRED BY PARAGRAPH (1)(a-d) PLAINTIFF'S BRIEF IS THE ONLY
   OPPORTUNITY FOR PLAINTIFF TO SET FORTH THE ERRORS PLAINTIFF CONTENDS
   WERE MADE BY THE COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL SECURITY THAT ENTITLE PLAINTIFF
   TO RELIEF. THE FAILURE TO FILE A BRIEF AS REQUIRED BY THIS ORDER WILL
   RESULT IN THE CONSIDERATION OF THIS APPEAL WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF
   PLAINTIFF'S ARGUMENTS AND MAY RESULT IN A DECISION HEAVILY INFLUENCED
   BY THE COMMISSIONER'S VERSION OF THE FACTS AND SUBSEQUENT DISMISSAL OF
   YOUR APPEAL. DATED January 24, 2002
