   Section B. Information Collected and How it is Used

   If you do nothing during your visit to our website but browse, read
   pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain
   information about your visit. This information does not identify you
   personally. We automatically collect and store the following
   information about your visit:
    1. The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used. The Internet
       Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your
       Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the
       Internet Protocol Address to direct Internet traffic to you. This
       address can be translated to determine the domain name of your
       service provider (e.g. company.com or yourschool.edu).
    2. The type of browser and operating system you used.
    3. The date and time you visited this site.
    4. The web pages or services you accessed at this site.
    5. The website you visited prior to coming to this website.

   The information we automatically collect or store is logged and used by
   EFSEC only to improve the content of our web services and to help us
   understand how people are using our services. EFSEC analyzes the
   website logs to determine how our website is being used, so that we may
   continually improve the site's usefulness to the public.

   What we collect if you volunteer information.

   If during your visit to our website you participate in a survey, send
   an Email, or perform some other transaction on-line, the following
   additional information will be collected:
    1. The Email address and contents for those who communicate with us
       via Email.
    2. Information volunteered in response to a survey.
    3. Information volunteered through an on-line form for any other

   Section C. Personal Information and Choice

   You may choose whether to provide personal information on-line.

   "Personal information" is information about a person that is readily
   identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information includes
   such things as an individual's name, address, and phone number. A
   domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal
   information.

   We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily
   provide it to us by sending us Email, participating in a survey, or
   completing an on-line form. You may choose not to contact us by Email,
   participate in a survey or to provide any personal information using an
   on-line form. Instead you may call us at 360-956-2121 or send us a
   letter (EFSEC, PO Box 43172, Olympia, WA 98504-3172). Your choice not
   to participate in these activities will not impair your ability to
   browse the EFSEC website and read or download any information provided
   on the site.

   If personal information is requested on the website or volunteered by
   the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it.
   However, this information becomes a public record once you provide it
   and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by
   federal or state law.

   If you believe your personal/private information is being used for a
   purpose other than what was intended when submitted, you may contact
   EFSEC as shown in the Contact Information Section of this statement.

   Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information
   requested from or volunteered by children on-line or by Email will be
   treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject
   to public access.

   Section D. Public Access to Information

   In the state of Washington, laws exist to ensure government is open and
   the public has a right to access appropriate records and information
   possessed by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions
   to the public's right to access public records that serve various needs
   including the privacy of individuals. Both state and federal laws
   provide exceptions.

   All of the information collected at this site becomes public record
   that may be subject to inspection and copying by members of the public,
   unless an exemption in law exists. RCW 42.17. 260(1) states that

   Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available
       for public inspection and copying all public records, unless the
       record falls within the specific exemptions of subsection (6) of
       this section [RCW 42.17.260(6)], RCW 42.17.310, 42.17.315, or other
       statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific
       information or records. To the extent required to prevent an
       unreasonable invasion of personal privacy interests protected by
       RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315, an agency shall delete identifying
       details in a manner consistent with RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315
       when it makes available or publishes any public record; however, in
       each case, the justification for the deletion shall be explained
       fully in writing.

   In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and the Public
   Records Act or other law governing the agencyÂ’s disclosure of records,
   the Public Records Act or other applicable law will control.

   Section E. Non-disclosure of Certain Personal/Private Information

   EFSEC may request/require you to provide certain personal/private
   information in order to conduct certain on-line transactions. The
   information is requested/required in order to complete such a
   transaction. You may choose not to provide this information, but if you
   choose not to provide it, we will be unable to process a transaction,
   and you will have to contact EFSEC to accomplish the same function
   either in person or by mail.

   Section F. Review and Correction of Personally Identifiable Information

   You can review any personally identifiable information we collect about
   you by using the information in the Contact Information section at the
   end of this notice. You may recommend changes to your personally
   identifiable information you believe to be inaccurate by submitting an
   Email or written request that credibly shows the inaccuracy. We will
   take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or
   making corrections. (RCW 43.105.310)
