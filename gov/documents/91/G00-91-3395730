   We are currently developing a search engine for our site, but in the
   mean time, to search much of the FSL web site, you can go to AltaVista
   and enter your search phrase in quotes, followed by host:fsl.noaa.gov .
   For example, to find FSL documents in which "mesoscale model" occurs,
   enter:

   "mesoscale model" host:fsl.noaa.gov

   You can limit other search expressions to a particular host in this
   way.

   However, AltaVista appears not to index all documents in any given
   site, so you may miss some information. We suggest that you ask the
   authors of documents found in the AltaVista search whether they have
   other information available that may also be helpful.
