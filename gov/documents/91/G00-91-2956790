                          Science Exploration Camp

                             A Vision Statement

   We would like to provide an environment rich in science and diversity
   of thought for children.

   We would like to foster a greater understanding and appreciation of the
   practical principals of science.

   We would like the children to work and practice the behavioral and
   mental approach required of scientists.

   We would like the children to gain insight into the workplace of their
   parents.

   The goal of the program is for the children to experience:
   enlightenment, introspectiveness, wonderment, challenge,excitement and
   fun.

   In order to accomplish the above goals, we require the following:
     * Encouraging children to wear the "scientist's hat" (or lab coat?)
       when approaching problem solving or observation.
     * Daily Science Journal entries based on their experiences and what
       they have observed throughout their day.
     * Staff and volunteers should be role models for the children.
     * Children should be aware of their surroundings, rules of behavior
       for certain locations and appreciation and respect for one another.
