   The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) maintains the Commerce
   Control List (CCL), which identifies items subject to Department of
   Commerce export controls. This final rule revises certain entries
   controlled for national security reasons in Categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
   Part I (telecommunications), 6, 7 and 9 to conform with changes in the
   List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies maintained and agreed to by
   governments participating in the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export
   Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies
   (Wassenaar Arrangement). The Wassenaar Arrangement controls strategic
   items with the objective of improving regional and international
   security and stability.

   The purpose of this final rule is to make the necessary changes to the
   Commerce Control List to implement revisions to the Wassenaar List that
   were agreed upon in the December 1, 2000 meeting and to make necessary
   revisions to reporting requirements. The majority of the changes that
   affected Category 4 items will be published in a separate rule.

   This rule amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to remove
   two Russian Entities from the Entity List found at Supplement 4 to part
   744 of the EAR. These entities were added to the list on July 29, 1998
   (63 FR 40363). The Bureau of Export Administration maintains the Entity
   List to notify the public of license requirements for exports to
   entities listed on it.

   India and Pakistan: Lifting of Sanctions, Removal of Indian and

   On September 22, 2001, President George W. Bush waived sanctions placed
   on India and Pakistan in May 1998, including those sanctions
   implemented by regulations issued on November 19, 1998 (63 FR 64322).
   This rule implements the waiver of these sanctions by removing the
   policy of denial for exports and reexports of items controlled for
   Nuclear Proliferation (NP) and Missile Technology (MT) reasons to India
   and Pakistan and restoring the use of License Exceptions for these
   items for entities not listed on the Entity List. In addition, this
   rule removes the supplementary measures taken in connection with the
   sanctions by removing a large number of Indian and Pakistani entities
   from the Entity List. The license requirements and review policy for
   the entities that remain on the list are set forth on the list itself.

   Revisions and Clarifications to the Export Administration Regulations
   -- Chemical and Biological Weapons Controls: Australia Group; Chemical
   Weapons Convention
   Download this information in a Word Perfect 6.1 || PDF || ASCII ||
   Format
   The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is amending the Export
   Administration Regulations (EAR) to implement the understandings
   reached at the October 2000 plenary meeting of the Australia Group
   (AG). This final rule amends the Commerce Control List (CCL) and the
   corresponding export licensing provisions in the EAR to authorize
   exports, without a license, to State Parties to the Chemical Weapons
   Convention (CWC) of medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing
   kits containing small quantities of AG-controlled chemicals that are
   also identified on CWC Schedule 2 or 3, provided that they meet certain
   criteria. An export license for these kits is still required for
   anti-terrorism (AT) reasons or for other reasons specified in the EAR
   (e.g., embargoes). This rule also amends the CCL to implement a new AG
   policy on mixtures containing certain AG-controlled chemicals. Mixtures
   containing less than 30 percent by weight (previously 25 percent or
   less) of any single AG-controlled chemical generally may be exported
   without a license, unless the controlled chemical is also: (1) a CWC
   Schedule 1 chemical or (2) a CWC Schedule 2 chemical destined for a
   State not Party to the CWC. However, exports of these mixtures to
   certain destinations continue to require a license for AT reasons or
   for other reasons specified in the EAR (e.g., embargoes).

   In addition, this final rule amends the CCL to clarify controls on
   certain graphite-lined chemical manufacturing equipment, to revise
   controls on centrifugal separators, and to establish a new minimum size
   threshold for the control of heat exchangers and condensers.
   Furthermore, this rule amends the EAR by adding Cyprus and Turkey to
   Country Group A:3, which identifies the countries that participate in
   the Australia Group, thereby eliminating license requirements for
   exports and reexports of certain AG-controlled items to these two
   countries.

   This rule also amends the CWC-related provisions in the EAR to clarify
   the export license requirements and policies for certain toxic
   chemicals and precursors listed in the Schedules of Chemicals contained
   within the Annex on Chemicals to the CWC. Specifically, this rule
   revises certain CWC-related provisions in the EAR to clarify BXA's
   export license requirements and policies in light of the CWC
   prohibition on retransfers of Schedule 1 chemicals to third countries
   and the CWC prohibition on exports of Schedule 2 chemicals to States
   not Party to the CWC that took effect on April 29, 2000.

   Finally, this rule updates the list of countries that are currently
   States Parties to the CWC by adding the following countries:
   Azerbaijan, Colombia, Dominica, Eritrea, Gabon, Jamaica, Kazakhstan,
   Kiribati, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, Mozambique, Nicaragua, San Marino,
   the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
   (Serbia and Montenegro), and Zambia.

   This interim final rule amends the Export Administration Regulations
   (EAR) by revising Country Group E:1 to include all terrorist-supporting
   countries, and replacing references to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North
   Korea, Sudan and Syria with Country Group E:1 where appropriate. This
   rule also expands the scope of eligible countries for License Exception
   TMP for exhibition and demonstration to all countries except the new
   Country Group E:1, with certain restrictions.

   definitions will be incorporated into other regulations of the EAR as

   Exports of Agricultural Commodities, Medicines and Medical Devices

   This rule amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to
   implement certain provisions of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export
   Enhancement Act (TSRA) of 2000. The TSRA requires the President to
   terminate existing U.S. unilateral agricultural and medical sanctions
   and also provides that the export of agricultural commodities,
   medicines and medical devices to designated terrorist countries be made
   in accordance with the licensing regime described in that Act. The
   Department of Commerce is implementing TSRA as it relates to exports of
   agricultural commodities to Cuba. This rule establishes License
   Exception Agricultural Commodities (AGR) to permit exports and
   reexports to Cuba of agricultural commodities that are not specifically
   identified on the Commerce Control List (CCL) and are classified as
   EAR99. The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets
   Control (OFAC) is implementing TSRA as it relates to exports to Iran,
   Libya, and Sudan of agricultural commodities, medicines and medical
   devices that are not specifically identified on the CCL and are
   classified as EAR99.

   The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) provide that the Bureau of
   Export Administration (BXA) may inform exporters, individually or
   through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for exports or
   reexports to certain entities. The EAR contain a list of such entities
   called the Entity List. This rule adds to the Entity List twelve
   entities located in the People's Republic of China (PRC). This rule
   also modifies three Russian entity listings and one Chinese entity
   listing, and makes one correction to an Israeli entity.

   The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) maintains the Commerce
   Control List (CCL), which identifies those items subject to Department
   of Commerce export controls. The CCL also reflects multilateral
   national security controls established by the Wassenaar Arrangement on
   Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods (the Wassenaar
   Arrangement), of which the United States is a founding member.In this
   regard, on December 1, 2000, the Wassenaar Arrangement agreed to
   implement several changes in its List of Dual-Use Goods and
   Technologies. This final rule revises the CCL to implement certain
   recently agreed changes in Category 3 (Electronics) and Category 4
   (Computers) of the Wassenaar List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies,
   specifically in the areas of microprocessors, graphic accelerators, and
   external interconnects. This change is being implemented to reflect
   rapid technological advances and controllability factors. Additional
   changes in the Wassenaar Dual-Use List will be implemented in the CCL
   in supplemental regulations.

   As a result of the admission of Brazil, Latvia, and Ukraine to the
   Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), this rule adds Brazil, Latvia, and
   Ukraine to Country Group A, Column A:4 (Nuclear Suppliers) and to the
   definition of "Nuclear Suppliers Group". On February 12, 1997 (62 FR
   6683), BXA published a regulation which removed the license requirement
   symbol for Brazil and Ukraine from the Commerce Country Chart, NP
   Column 1 (Nuclear Nonproliferation). This rule removes the license
   requirement symbol for Latvia from the Commerce Country Chart, NP
   Column 1. The Nuclear Supplies Group member countries have agreed to
   establish export licensing procedures for the transfer of items
   identified on the Annex to the "Nuclear-Related Dual-Use Equipment,
   Materials, and Related Technology List," which is published by the
   International Atomic Energy Agency.

   In addition, Austria, Finland, Ireland and Sweden are added to
   "Countries Not Subject to Certain Nuclear End-Use Restrictions in
   §744.2(a)", because of their commitment to nuclear non-proliferation.

   1999. However, a license is required for all exports and reexports by
   U.S. persons of any item subject to the EAR to persons listed pursuant
   to Executive Order 13088, as amended by Executive Order 13192 of
   January 17, 2001. The persons subject to sanctions under amended
   Executive Order 13088 include Slobodan Milosevic, his family, his close
   associates, and those indicted for war crimes. These sanctioned persons
   are identified on the list of specially designated nationals and
   blocked persons maintained by the Department of the Treasury's Office
   of Foreign Assets Control and identified by the bracketed suffix
   initials [FRYM]. Controls are maintained under the EAR on arms and
   related matériel to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
   Montenegro) consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolution
   1160 of March 3, 1998.

   The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is amending the Export
   Administration Regulations (EAR) by revising License Exception CTP to
   reflect rapid technological advances in computing capability. This rule
   implements the President's sixth revision to U.S. export controls on
   high performance computers (HPCs), announced January 10, 2001. License
   Exception CTP is revised by removing Computer Tier 2 and merging its
   countries into Computer Tier 1. All HPCs continue to be eligible for
   export to a Computer Tier 1 country under License Exception CTP.
   Additionally, HPCs with CTP up to 85,000 MTOPS can be exported to
   Computer Tier 3 countries under License Exception CTP, and beginning
   March 20, 2001, exporters will no longer be required to submit National
   Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) advance notifications for HPCs with
   CTP exceeding 85,000 MTOPS. The NDAA advance notification will not be
   required for these computers, because exporters will be submitting a
   license for exports to Computer Tier 3 countries of HPCs with CTP
   exceeding 85,000 MTOPS. This rule also moves Lithuania from Computer
   Tier 3 to Computer Tier 1, effective May 19, 2001. The President's
   action will promote our national security, enhance the effectiveness of
   our export control system and ease unnecessary regulatory burdens on
   both government and industry.

   On November 16, 2000, Shaykh Hamad bin Ali bin Jaber Al-Thani delivered
   to Baghdad, Iraq, a Boeing 747 aircraft to Iraqi President Saddam
   Hussein as a gift. This action violated the United Nations Security
   Council resolution restricting trade with Iraq. To guard against
   further such diversions to Iraq, BXA published this rule which imposes
   a license requirement for exports and reexports of all items subject to
   the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) that are on the Commerce
   Control List destined to or for Shaykh Hamad bin Ali bin Jaber Al-Thani

   treatment of products incorporating short-range wireless technologies,
   open cryptographic interfaces, beta test software, encryption source
   code, and U.S. content (de minimis) requirements. This rule also
   allows, for the first time, exporters to self-classify unilateral
   controlled encryption products (that fall under Export Control
   Classification Numbers (ECCNs) 5A992, 5D992 and 5E992) upon
   notification to the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA). Restrictions

   Performance Computers (HPCs) with a composite theoretical performance
   (CTP) of up to 45,000 millions of theoretical operations per second
   (MTOPS) can be exported to Computer Tier 2 countries under License
   Exception CTP, and HPCs with a CTP up to 28,000 MTOPS can be exported
   Computer Tier 3 destinations under License Exception CTP. The
   civil-military distinction for computer Tier 3 end-users and end-uses
   is removed. Effective February 26, 2001, this rule also raises the
   advance notification level for HPC exports to Computer Tier 3 countries
   to 28,000 MTOPS. As required by the National Defense Authorization Act
   of 1998 (NDAA), changes in the advance notification level for HPC
   exports to Tier 3 destinations are only effective 180 days following
   the submission by the President of a report to Congress. The President
   sent the report to Congress on August 30, 2000. This rule moves

   Accordingly, High Performance Computers (HPCs) with a composite
   theoretical performance (CTP) of up to 33,000 millions of theoretical
   operations per second (MTOPS) can be exported to Computer Tier 2
   countries, and HPCs with a CTP up to 20,000 MTOPS can be exported to
   civilian end-users and end-uses in Computer Tier 3 destinations under
   License Exception CTP. For military end-users and end-uses in Computer
   Tier 3 countries, the CTP limit remains at 6,500 MTOPS until August 14,
   2000, when it is raised to 12,500 MTOPS. This coincides with the date
   this rule raises the advance notification level for HPC exports to
   Computer Tier 3 countries to 12,500 MTOPS. As required by the National
   Defense Authorization Act of 1998 (NDAA), changes in the advance

   On August 3, 1999, the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) amended
   the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by raising the performance
   parameters for those computers which can be exported and reexported
   under License Exception CTP. The upper threshold of the Composite
   Theoretical Performance (CTP) parameter for Computer Tier 2 countries
   is raised from 10,000 millions of theoretical operations per second
   (MTOPS) to 20,000 MTOPS. The upper threshold for Computer Tier 3
   countries is raised from 7,000 MTOPS to 12,300 MTOPS for civilian
   end-users and end-uses. For military end-users and end-uses in Computer
   Tier 3 destinations the CTP parameter remains at 2,000 MTOPS for the
   immediate future. The upper parameter for military end-users and
   end-uses to Computer Tier 3 countries will be raised from 2,000 MTOPS
   to 6,500 MTOPS on the same date the threshold for advance notification
   for high performance computers (HPC) exports to Tier 3 countries is
   raised from 2,000 MTOPS to 6,500 MTOPS. The threshold for advance
   notification for exports of HPCs to Tier 3 countries is raised to 6,500
   MTOPS, effective approximately 180 days following the submission of a
   statutorily mandated report to Congress. The President sent this report
   to Congress on July 26, 1999. In addition, the following countries are
