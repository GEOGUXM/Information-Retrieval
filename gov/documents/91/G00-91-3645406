   This performs a case-insensitive search using a number of keywords.

   You can use the booleans and, or, or not in searching. Without these
   booleans, the search will assume you're anding the words together.
   Evaluation takes place from left to right only, although you can use
   parentheses to force the order of evaluation.

   You can also use wildcards (asterisks) to search for matches to the
   beginnings of words only - you can't put asterisks at the front or in
   the middle of words.

  example 1: john and doe or jane
  example 2: john and (doe or not jane)
  example 3: not (john or jane) and doe
  example 4: j* and doe

    1. This search evaluates the expression from left to right.
    2. This search will also be evaluated from left to right, although the
       operation in parentheses will be evaluated as a whole first.
    3. john or jane will be evaluated first, a not operation will be
       performed on that, then everything will be anded with doe.
    4. This will search for all files that contain words starting with the
       letter j and that also contain doe.
