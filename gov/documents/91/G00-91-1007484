   Summary

   From 1947 to 1981, the Stauffer Chemical Company in Tarpon Springs,
   Florida, made elemental phosphorus from phosphate ore. While the plant
   was in operation, phosphorus slag was transported off the site and used
   as aggregate in road bedding, road and driveway paving, and in concrete
   structures. Residents in the area are concerned about possible adverse
   health effects resulting from exposure to gamma radiation from
   phosphorus slag that was used in nearby roads, buildings, and homes.
   Gamma radiation, or gamma rays, consists of bundles of electromagnetic
   energy and is the same type of radiation as medical x-rays.

   In 1999, at their request, residents of the community surrounding the
   former Stauffer chemical plant were given thermoluminescent dosimeters
   (TLDs) by the Pinellas County Health Department to monitor their
   individual gamma radiation dose measurements for a 30-day period. As a
   follow-up to the previous public health assessment addendum for the
   site issued in June 1999 and to a draft public health response plan for
   the site released in June 2001, the Agency for Toxic Substances and
   Disease Registry (ATSDR) reviewed the individual dose measurements
   recorded by the Pinellas County Health Department for the residents of
   this Tarpon Springs, Florida, community.

   Background, or naturally occurring radiation, varies by location in the
   United States and is measured in one-thousandth of rem, or millirem
   (mrem). Background gamma radiation dose rates for the United States
   average anywhere from 44 to 133 mrem per year. The average dose to the
   residents monitored in Pinellas and Pasco counties was 92 mrem per
   year, although it was not possible to quantify the contribution from
   slag. Those monitored residents in homes near the Stauffer site had an
   average annual dose of 91 mrem, which was not statistically different
   from the average dose of 95 mrem per year to those monitored residents
   living farther from the site.

   These measurements show that the combined gamma radiation doses from
   homes and pavement with phosphorus slag are not elevated and do not
   pose a health threat.

   Background and Statement of Issues

   As a follow-up action to the previous public health assessment addendum
   for the Stauffer Chemical Company site and Vicinity Properties in
   Tarpon Springs and Holiday, Florida, which was issued in June 1999, and
   to a draft public health response plan for the site released in 2001,
   the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) evaluated
   the gamma radiation doses measured by the Pinellas County Health
   Department for residents near the site who had requested this
   assessment. The Pinellas County Health Department, responding to public
   demand, provided thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) to persons who
   wanted their radiation dose measured and who lived near the former
   Stauffer chemical plant in Tarpon Springs, Florida. TLDs are made of
   crystalline material (solid state) that emits light in proportion to
   the ionizing radiation absorbed, when the device is heated.

   Dose measurements performed at the residents' request were purely
   voluntary. TLDs were distributed to residents of the communities
   surrounding the former plant, regardless of whether they had phosphorus
   slag on their property. These residents were asked to wear the TLDs all
   day for a 30-day period, but not during medical procedures (e.g.,
   x-rays), and measurements were extrapolated, or projected, to yearly
   doses. The measurements were taken during the last few months of 1999.
   The Pinellas County Health Department assumed that participants were
   exposed to slag, based on the distance of their homes from the former
   Stauffer site. Those participants living closer to the site were
   assumed to be more exposed to radiation from the slag. Table 1 displays
   the doses for persons living near the Stauffer Superfund site and who
   were assumed to have slag in their homes. Table 2 shows the doses for
   persons who did not live near the site and who were assumed to not have
   slag in their homes^ (1). Use of phosphorus slag is widespread in this
   part of Florida, and most people are, to some degree, exposed to gamma
   radiation from the slag.

   The average dose for those living in homes assumed to contain slag was
   91 mrem per year and 95 mrem per year for those living in homes assumed
   not to contain slag. A simple two-sample t-test and Welch modified
   two-sample t-test both showed no statistically significant difference
   in means at the 95% confidence level. The 95% confidence intervals were
   nearly identical, being 56 - 125 mrem/year for residents near the
   Stauffer site and 69 - 121 mrem/year for residents farther from the
   site. Graphs of the dosimetry data are presented in Figures 1 and 2,
   with Figure 1 depicting data for those in homes near the Stauffer site
   and Figure 2 showing data for those not near the site.

   The average dose rate to all participants was 92 mrem per year. All but
   one of the doses measured were within the range of normal background
   doses for the contiguous United States. Average background doses from
   terrestrial and cosmic gamma radiation for cities in the United States
   range from 44 to 133 mrem per year^ (2).

                               [stauffer2.jpg]

   The average dose to those residents assumed to have no slag in their
   homes was 4.5 mrem higher than the dose to those with slag in their
   homes. There was no statistical difference in average doses. Moreover,
   these measured doses are consistent with published values for
   background doses from external ionizing radiation in this area^ (3).

   In Figure 1, the block at 166 mrem is based on a single individual dose
   for subject #49 and is outside the normal range of background doses.
   According to Chauvenet's criterion^ (4), this measurement is clearly an
   outlier and is more than four standard deviations above the mean.

   Conclusions

   1. The combined gamma radiation doses from homes and pavement with
   phosphorus slag measured for residents near the former Stauffer
   chemical plant are consistent with background and do not pose a health
   threat to the community. Because assumptions were made about which
   homes contained slag and which homes did not contain slag, the
   contribution to annual radiation doses from phosphorus slag at this
   location cannot be quantified. The average dose to monitored residents
   in homes assumed to contain slag (91 mrem) was statistically similar to
   the average dose to those evaluated in homes assumed not to contain
   slag (95 mrem).

   2. The individual that received 166 mrem dose is outside the normal
   range of background. According to Chauvenet's Criterion, this
   measurement is clearly an outlier and is more than 4 standard
   deviations above the mean, although not of sufficient magnitude to
   warrant concern from a health standpoint.

   Recommendation
     * Pinellas County or the State of Florida should re-measure the dose
       and perform a radiation survey at the location where the 166 mrem
       level was observed.
     * If the initial measurement is validated, explore what, if any,
       ALARA measures might be appropriate.
