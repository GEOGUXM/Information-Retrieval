   For Release: January 2, 2002

   FTC Broadens Warnings to Marketers of Bioterrorism Defense Products

   E-mails Focus on Questionable Claims for Bioterrorism Protection
   Devices

   A month after sending out 50 warnings to promoters of purported
   medicinal cures or treatments for anthrax and other bioterrorism
   agents, the Federal Trade Commission staff has sent out 71 more
   e-mails, this time focusing on promoters of such dubious protection
   devices as air filters, gas masks, protective clothing, and ultraviolet
   light mechanisms. In its recent letters, the FTC warned marketers that
   stringent standards and rigorous tests are required before products can
   be touted as truly capable of deterring biological and chemical
   threats. Web sites that make these claims were warned that if their
   assertions cannot be supported by competent and reliable scientific
   evidence, they must be removed from the Web.

   The e-mail warnings stem from a coordinated Internet "surf" by the FTC
   with the help of the Food and Drug Administration, more than 30 state
   attorneys general, and the California Department of Health Services.
   The Internet search turned up more than 200 sites marketing
   bioterrorism-related products and now has resulted in a total of 121
   warnings sent by the FTC. The initial wave of warnings in mid-November
   was sent primarily to promoters of medicinal products, while the latest
   round of letters sent in mid-December, targeted devices ostensibly
   providing protection from nuclear, biological, or chemical
   contaminants. So far, more than 25 of the initial 50 warned sites have
   eliminated suspect claims to satisfy the FTC's concerns; others that
   have not yet complied face potential prosecution.

   "This recent round of e-mails demonstrates our continuing concern about
   questionable claims for bioterrorism protection products," said FTC
   Consumer Protection Bureau Director J. Howard Beales. "We, along with
   other participants in the surf, are prepared to follow up with legal
   actions if the recipients of these and our earlier letters do not come
   into compliance."

   The letters warned that FTC staff will follow up by revisiting the
   targeted sites to determine whether changes have been made. Operators
   who make deceptive or misleading claims face possible prosecution for
   violating the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act). Firms or
   individuals who violate the FTC Act could be subject to a federal
   district court injunction, enforceable through civil or criminal
   contempt proceedings; or an administrative cease and desist order,
   enforceable through civil penalties of up to $11,000 per violation.
   Sellers also could be ordered to make consumer refunds.

   Additionally, the FTC is referring suspect sites to state and other
   federal agencies with appropriate enforcement authority. Recent
   referrals made by the FTC to the Environmental Protection Agency
   resulted in orders to two companies to stop immediately the marketing
   of products claiming to protect the public from anthrax. The companies
   have since removed the promotion for these products from their Web
   sites.

   Consumer Education

   As noted in an FTC press release announcing the mid-November warnings,
   the FTC offers the following advice for consumers who visit Web sites
   or receive e-mails claiming to sell products to protect against,
   detect, prevent, or treat anthrax, small pox, or other biological or
   chemical health hazards:
     * Be wary of unscrupulous marketers who use cyberspace to peddle
       "miracle" treatments and cures. Many of the ads and Web sites,
       which feature exotic potions and pills, special curative diets,
       strange magnetic or electrical devices, or newly discovered
       treatments, contain questionable claims about the effectiveness and
       safety of these products or services. The only known effective
       treatments for biological agents like anthrax or smallpox are
       approved prescription drugs and vaccines.
     * Be a savvy Internet shopper. For additional information, visit:

   For consumers who visit Web sites and receive e-mails claiming to sell
   Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and other antibiotics to treat anthrax, the FTC
   recently issued a Consumer Alert titled "Offers to Treat Biological
   Threats: What You Need to Know," produced in conjunction with the
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA. The Alert
   advises consumers to:
     * Talk to your health care professional before you use any
       medications.

     * Know that some Web sites may sell ineffective drugs.

     * Know from whom you are buying.

     * Don't do business with Web sites that don't give you access to
       pharmacists to answer questions.

     * Avoid sites that don't provide their name, physical business
       address, and phone number.

     * Don't purchase drugs from foreign Web sites.

   In addition to the FTC, partners in this bioterrorism surf included the
   FDA, and offices of the attorneys general of Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas,
   California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland,
   Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New
   Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon,
   Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia,
   Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The District of Columbia Office of
   the Corporation Counsel, and the California Department of Health
   Services also participated in the surf.
