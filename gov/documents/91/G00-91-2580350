   HEATED-COLUMN CALPASTATIN 1. Extract 10 grams of the sample in 3 x
   volume of extraxction buffer (in a waring blendor) plus the following
   inhibitors: 2mM PMSF, 6 mg/liter leupeptin, and 100 mg/liter ovomucoid.
   2. Centrifuge at 16,500 rpm for 1.5 hours. (Beckman JA-17 rotor) 3.
   Dialyze against 1X elution buffer (minus MCE) overnight. 4. Transfer
   dialyzed sample into 35 ml centrifuge tubes.(We use a 10 ml pipet) 5.
   Heat in 95 C water bath. Stirring with a glass rod and checking sample
   temperature every 5 minutes until it is up to 95 C. Heat for 15 minutes
   after 95 C is reached. 6. Cool in ice bath for 10 minutes. Stir sample
   with a glass rod and centrifuge for 1 hour.(JA-17 16,500 rpm). Filter
   through glasswool. 7. Load on 10 ml DEAE-Seph. column equilibrated to
   1X(-MCE). 8. Wash with 100 ml of 1X + 25 mM NaCl. 9. Elute with 1X +
   200 mM NaCl. Collecting 9 X 5ml fractions. 10. Screen the fractions for
   activity by assaying and using 0.5 ml of each fraction. Assay for 30
   min. and record visual activity. (active, partial activity, no
   activity) 11. Pool partially active, and active fractions. Measure
   volume while pooling. 12. Assay pooled fractions for calpastatin.
   (.1-.5 ml with Ca++, and 1.0 ml with EDTA) 13. Sequentially add the
   following: -Appropriate volume of sample + 1X elution to make total
   volume of 1 ml + sufficient volume of m-calpain having net activity of
   0.30-.40, vortex and then add 1.0 ml of assay media and then 100 ul of
   100 mM CaCl2. Vortex. Incubate at 25 C for 60 min. Stop the reaction
   with 2 ml of 5% TCA (Trichloroacetic acid). Centrifuge for 30 min. at
   2000 rpm. Read A278. Reference : Koohmaraie, M., S.D. Shackelford, T.

   Transfer remaining buffer into large mouth Ehrlenmeyer flask. Gradually
   add Casein-Hammerstein. Allow this to stir for 1-2 hours after all of
   the casein is added. Using a 50 ml syringe and 14 gauge needle, slowly
   drip in 130 ml of 1N acetic acid. Allow this to stir for 1-2 hours
   after all of the acetic acid is added. Check the pH and adjust, if
   necessary, to 7.5 with 1 N acetic acid. Store at 4oC. Add 4Âµl/ml MCE
   right before use. 5% Trichloroacetic Acid(TCA) Make 50% TCA by
   dissolving 1 kg of TCA crystals in 2 liters of DD H2O. Store in the
   refigerator. To make 5% TCA: Dilute 50% stock TCA 1:10 (10 ml of 50%
   TCA in 90 ml of DDH2O). Make fresh daily.
