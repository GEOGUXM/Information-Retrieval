Summary

   There are a number of policies and procedures which apply to users of
   the NERSC High Performance Computing Facility. These policies and
   procedures originate from a number of sources, such as DOE regulations,
   DOE and NERSC management, and user requests. Regardless of their
   origin, they are intended to facilitate efficient and secure use of the
   shared resources for computational science found at NERSC.

   Account Policies must be accepted and followed by all NERSC users.
   There are also Operational and Security Procedures related to the
   secure and efficient use of shared resources.

   Account Management Web Forms are for use by PI's and Account Managers,
   and a set of general User Request and Report Web Forms is provided to
   facilitate communication between users and NERSC.
